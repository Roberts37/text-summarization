       "      <td>As a data enthusiast, exploring a new dataset is an exciting endeavour. It allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the data and lays the foundation for successful analysis. Getting a good feeling for a new dataset is not always easy, and takes time. However, a good and thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) can help a lot to understand your dataset and get a feeling for how things are connected and what needs to be done to properly process your dataset. Infact, you probably will spend 80% of your time in data preparation and exploration and only 20% in actual data modelling. For other types of analysis, exploration might take an even larger proportion of your time. Exploratory Data Analysis, simply put, refers to the art of exploring data. It is the process of investigating data from different angles to enhance your understanding, exploring patterns, establishing relationships between variables and if required enhancing the data itself Its like going on a ‘blind’ date with your dataset, sitting across the table from this enigmatic collection of numbers and texts, yearning to understand it before embarking on a serious relationship. Just like a blind date, EDA allows you to uncover the hidden facets of your dataset. You observe patterns, detect outliers, and explore the nuances before making any significant commitments. It’s all about getting acquainted and building trust with the numbers, ensuring you’re on solid ground before drawing conclusions. We as analysts and data scientists are supposed to best understand the data. We must become the experts when it comes to understanding and interpreting the data. Whether it is machine learning models, experimentation frameworks or simple analytics — the outcome is as good as the data on which it is based.</td>\n",

Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing…</td>\n",

       "      <td>Exercise is often recommended for mental well-being, but in my experience, intense activities like hurling and running can sometimes make my mania symptoms worse. I used to play hurling, but now I stick to running because I enjoy the feeling of completing a run. Looking back two years, I made a risky choice to stop taking my medication and started running four times a week. I even signed up for the Clontarf half marathon, aiming to finish in under 1 hour and 30 minutes. I also took on the Clondalkin half marathon. I pushed myself hard during training, and the excitement after each run became addictive. Despite some awareness that I might be pushing too far, the thrill of setting personal records, like finishing the Clondalkin half marathon in 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 21 seconds, kept me going. Things took a turn after completing a 5k parkrun in under 19 minutes. I started feeling overly confident, signalling potential danger. With the Clontarf half marathon approaching, I had irrational thoughts of breaking the world record with a 56-minute finish. How crazy is that? On race day, my delusions peaked, believing I embodied an ancient Irish ancestor. Realising I wasn't well, a voice urged me to seek help. My wife, waiting at the finish line, got worried when I didn't show up. At home, the situation escalated, and neighbours called the police due to my erratic behaviour. After this challenging time, a moment of clarity allowed me to function again. I resumed my medication, vowing not to stop again. While I still crave the positive feeling running gives me, I recognise the importance of staying on my medication for mental health. After a year without running, I've cautiously reintroduced it into my routine, making sure to stay committed to my medication to protect against the unpredictable challenges of mania.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Despite never receiving my BA in Agenting from the prestigious East West School of Agenting in North Hollywood, I’ve worked at a talent agency for over a decade. Learning how to “agent” isn’t something taught in schools and most of the educational process is through firsthand experience. I find every agent’s backstory incredibly refreshing because agents (and those in the representation field) all have a different journey to the same destination. Throughout my career, I’ve worked alongside agents who once were casting directors, PAs, producers, baristas, publicists, lawyers, bakers, flight attendants and, of course, actors who all found their own unique way into representation. And while each background shapes their entry into representation, continuing education is essential to growing as an agent. As an avid reader, I turned to literature to help shape my perspective and process for advising clients from both a creative and business perspective. What I found was that a lot of these books also had applicable perspectives to help actors in their career journey as well. Here are eight books that helped shape my own knowledge of the entertainment industry and provided business insight on how to help actors stand out from the crowd while avoiding professional burnout. A new release, Burn It Down highlights many historic problems in Hollywood and how to address them moving forward. While Hollywood has experienced a lot of change in the last few years with the #MeToo, #PayUpHollywood and #OscarsSoWhite movements, Hollywood has a long way to go in removing players and practices that are detrimental to the industry. Agents and managers are in representation because we want to advocate for actors. This does not just mean finding them work opportunities. It also includes–to the best of our abilities–making sure those are safe sets with other employees who are respectful and courteous. It’s irresponsible to be working in a position of power in the entertainment industry in 2023 and not want to make the industry better than how we found it. This book provides a blueprint of how to restructure Hollywood’s structure moving forward.</td>\n",

It allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the data and lays the foundation for successful analysis. Getting a good feeling for a new dataset is not always easy, and takes time. However, a good and thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) can help a lot to understand your dataset and get a feeling for how things are connected and what needs to be done to properly process your dataset. Infact, you probably will spend 80% of your time in data preparation and exploration and only 20% in actual data modelling. For other types of analysis, exploration might take an even larger proportion of your time. Exploratory Data Analysis, simply put, refers to the art of exploring data. It is the process of investigating data from different angles to enhance your understanding, exploring patterns, establishing relationships between variables and if required enhancing the data itself Its like going on a ‘blind’ date with your dataset, sitting across the table from this enigmatic collection of numbers and texts, yearning to understand it before embarking on a serious relationship. Just like a blind date, EDA allows you to uncover the hidden facets of your dataset. You observe patterns, detect outliers, and explore the nuances before making any significant commitments. It’s all about getting acquainted and building trust with the numbers, ensuring you’re on solid ground before drawing conclusions. We as analysts and data scientists are supposed to best understand the data. We must become the experts when it comes to understanding and interpreting the data. Whether it is machine learning models, experimentation frameworks or simple analytics — the outcome is as good as the data on which it is based.   \n",

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing…   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Exercise is often recommended for mental well-being, but in my experience, intense activities like hurling and running can sometimes make my mania symptoms worse. I used to play hurling, but now I stick to running because I enjoy the feeling of completing a run. Looking back two years, I made a risky choice to stop taking my medication and started running four times a week. I even signed up for the Clontarf half marathon, aiming to finish in under 1 hour and 30 minutes. I also took on the Clondalkin half marathon. I pushed myself hard during training, and the excitement after each run became addictive. Despite some awareness that I might be pushing too far, the thrill of setting personal records, like finishing the Clondalkin half marathon in 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 21 seconds, kept me going. Things took a turn after completing a 5k parkrun in under 19 minutes. I started feeling overly confident, signalling potential danger. With the Clontarf half marathon approaching, I had irrational thoughts of breaking the world record with a 56-minute finish. How crazy is that? On race day, my delusions peaked, believing I embodied an ancient Irish ancestor. Realising I wasn't well, a voice urged me to seek help. My wife, waiting at the finish line, got worried when I didn't show up. At home, the situation escalated, and neighbours called the police due to my erratic behaviour. After this challenging time, a moment of clarity allowed me to function again. I resumed my medication, vowing not to stop again. While I still crave the positive feeling running gives me, I recognise the importance of staying on my medication for mental health. After a year without running, I've cautiously reintroduced it into my routine, making sure to stay committed to my medication to protect against the unpredictable challenges of mania.   \n",

Disclaimer: This is my personal story and view on social anxiety.. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or provide professional advice for anyone with this condition. If you think you may have social anxiety or any other mental health issue, please consult a therapist or doctor. I hope this helps you learn more about social anxiety and its impact on people’s lives. It is absolutely okay to feel overwhelmed by social anxiety. It’s a mental trap and it can be incredibly challenging to deal with. It’s not just about feeling socially shy or nervous, but an actual debilitating sense of fear and discomfort that can make the simplest interactions feel impossible. Shyness is a mild discomfort or awkwardness, while Social anxiety is a full-blown storm of physical and psychological symptoms, including sweating, trembling, rapid heart rate, and panic attacks. It can be hard to express just how challenging these symptoms can be, and it’s important to recognize the strength it takes to live with social anxiety every day. can involve many things, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Anti-anxiety medication can provide relief for some people, but it is not a universal fix and should always be discussed with a mental health professional. Therapy is an important addition to treatment, and it helps people such as myself, to develop coping skills, challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, and gradually increase our social exposure.   \n",
       "4  Despite never receiving my BA in Agenting from the prestigious East West School of Agenting in North Hollywood, I’ve worked at a talent agency for over a decade. Learning how to “agent” isn’t something taught in schools and most of the educational process is through firsthand experience. I find every agent’s backstory incredibly refreshing because agents (and those in the representation field) all have a different journey to the same destination. Throughout my career, I’ve worked alongside agents who once were casting directors, PAs, producers, baristas, publicists, lawyers, bakers, flight attendants and, of course, actors who all found their own unique way into representation. And while each background shapes their entry into representation, continuing education is essential to growing as an agent. As an avid reader, I turned to literature to help shape my perspective and process for advising clients from both a creative and business perspective. What I found was that a lot of these books also had applicable perspectives to help actors in their career journey as well. Here are eight books that helped shape my own knowledge of the entertainment industry and provided business insight on how to help actors stand out from the crowd while avoiding professional burnout. A new release, Burn It Down highlights many historic problems in Hollywood and how to address them moving forward. While Hollywood has experienced a lot of change in the last few years with the #MeToo, #PayUpHollywood and #OscarsSoWhite movements, Hollywood has a long way to go in removing players and practices that are detrimental to the industry. Agents and managers are in representation because we want to advocate for actors. This does not just mean finding them work opportunities. It also includes–to the best of our abilities–making sure those are safe sets with other employees who are respectful and courteous. It’s irresponsible to be working in a position of power in the entertainment industry in 2023 and not want to make the industry better than how we found it. This book provides a blueprint of how to restructure Hollywood’s structure moving forward.   "

       "      <td>Exercise is often recommended for mental wellbeing but in my experience intense activities like hurling and running can sometimes make my mania symptoms worse I used to play hurling but now I stick to running because I enjoy the feeling of completing a run Looking back two years I made a risky choice to stop taking my medication and started running four times a week I even signed up for the Clontarf half marathon aiming to finish in under 1 hour and 30 minutes I also took on the Clondalkin half marathon I pushed myself hard during training and the excitement after each run became addictive Despite some awareness that I might be pushing too far the thrill of setting personal records like finishing the Clondalkin half marathon in 1 hour 27 minutes and 21 seconds kept me going Things took a turn after completing a 5k parkrun in under 19 minutes I started feeling overly confident signalling potential danger With the Clontarf half marathon approaching I had irrational thoughts of breaking the world record with a 56minute finish How crazy is that On race day my delusions peaked believing I embodied an ancient Irish ancestor Realising I wasnt well a voice urged me to seek help My wife waiting at the finish line got worried when I didnt show up At home the situation escalated and neighbours called the police due to my erratic behaviour After this challenging time a moment of clarity allowed me to function again I resumed my medication vowing not to stop again While I still crave the positive feeling running gives me I recognise the importance of staying on my medication for mental health After a year without running Ive cautiously reintroduced it into my routine making sure to stay committed to my medication to protect against the unpredictable challenges of mania</td>\n",

       "4  Despite never receiving my BA in Agenting from the prestigious East West School of Agenting in North Hollywood Ive worked at a talent agency for over a decade Learning how to agent isnt something taught in schools and most of the educational process is through firsthand experience I find every agents backstory incredibly refreshing because agents and those in the representation field all have a different journey to the same destination Throughout my career Ive worked alongside agents who once were casting directors PAs producers baristas publicists lawyers bakers flight attendants and of course actors who all found their own unique way into representation And while each background shapes their entry into representation continuing education is essential to growing as an agent As an avid reader I turned to literature to help shape my perspective and process for advising clients from both a creative and business perspective What I found was that a lot of these books also had applicable perspectives to help actors in their career journey as well Here are eight books that helped shape my own knowledge of the entertainment industry and provided business insight on how to help actors stand out from the crowd while avoiding professional burnout A new release Burn It Down highlights many historic problems in Hollywood and how to address them moving forward While Hollywood has experienced a lot of change in the last few years with the MeToo PayUpHollywood and OscarsSoWhite movements Hollywood has a long way to go in removing players and practices that are detrimental to the industry Agents and managers are in representation because we want to advocate for actors This does not just mean finding them work opportunities It also includesto the best of our abilitiesmaking sure those are safe sets with other employees who are respectful and courteous Its irresponsible to be working in a position of power in the entertainment industry in 2023 and not want to make the industry better than how we found it This book provides a blueprint of how to restructure Hollywoods structure moving forward  "

       "      <td>Despite never receiving my BA in Agenting from the prestigious East West School of Agenting in North Hollywood Ive worked at a talent agency for over a decade Learning how to agent isnt something taught in schools and most of the educational process is through firsthand experience I find every agents backstory incredibly refreshing because agents and those in the representation field all have a different journey to the same destination Throughout my career Ive worked alongside agents who once were casting directors PAs producers baristas publicists lawyers bakers flight attendants and of course actors who all found their own unique way into representation And while each background shapes their entry into representation continuing education is essential to growing as an agent As an avid reader I turned to literature to help shape my perspective and process for advising clients from both a creative and business perspective What I found was that a lot of these books also had applicable perspectives to help actors in their career journey as well Here are eight books that helped shape my own knowledge of the entertainment industry and provided business insight on how to help actors stand out from the crowd while avoiding professional burnout A new release Burn It Down highlights many historic problems in Hollywood and how to address them moving forward While Hollywood has experienced a lot of change in the last few years with the MeToo PayUpHollywood and OscarsSoWhite movements Hollywood has a long way to go in removing players and practices that are detrimental to the industry Agents and managers are in representation because we want to advocate for actors This does not just mean finding them work opportunities It also includesto the best of our abilitiesmaking sure those are safe sets with other employees who are respectful and courteous Its irresponsible to be working in a position of power in the entertainment industry in 2023 and not want to make the industry better than how we found it This book provides a blueprint of how to restructure Hollywoods structure moving forward</td>\n",
