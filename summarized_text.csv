its widespread use and economic significance Copper isotopes particularly Copper63 and Copper65 have industrial and scientific importance while in the digital realm cryptocurrencies like Edelcoin represent the new frontier of asset tokenization This article delves into the intersection of these seemingly disparate worlds exploring how they are becoming increasingly interconnected Copper is a cornerstone of the industrial economy and is essential in electrical wiring plumbing telecommunications and renewable energy systems Its properties such as high conductivity malleability and resistance to corrosion make it indispensable in modern technology The metal exists naturally in two stable isotopic forms Copper63 and Copper65 with natural abundances of approximately 69 and 31 respectively According to the latest data from the US Geological Survey global mine production of copper reached about 20 million metric tons in 2021 The price of copper is subject to minor market fluctuations due to its industrial demand and mining outputs Copper63 and Copper65 have specialized uses in scientific fields Copper63 is used in nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy a technique to observe local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei Copper65 due to its potential as a gammaray source finds applications in medical and industrial radiography The market for these isotopes is stable and determined by their rarity and the cost of enrichment While there is no publicly traded market for copper isotopes their value is tied to the broader copper market and the specific demands of the sectors they serve Cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary digital asset class offering a decentralized secure and borderless means of transaction Cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers This technology ensures transparency security and immutability appealing attributes for users Edelcoin represents an innovative step in assetbacked digital currencies It is a cryptocurrency backed by a basket of precious and base metals The concept behind Edelcoin and similar tokens is to combine the tangible value of traditional assets with the efficiency and liquidity of cryptocurrency The idea is to provide a stable payment option within the volatile crypto market as the underlying value of the token is tied to a physical commodity with intrinsic value This mitigates price swings associated with cryptocurrencies as the tokens value can be anchored to the more stable prices of the metals backing it Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain This can apply to any asset including real estate art or as with Edelcoin precious metals The benefits of tokenization are manifold The intersection of traditional assets like copper and the innovative world of cryptocurrency represents a fascinating evolution in how we think about value and ownership Copper isotopes such as Copper63 and Copper65 have critical industrial and scientific applications while cryptocurrencies like Edelcoin aim to leverage the stability of such assets to create a new kind of opportunity As the world becomes increasingly digital the fusion of traditional and modern asset classes through tokenization may become more prevalent However as with any emerging technology it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence stay informed about regulatory changes and consider the inherent risks and opportunities that come with

is one of the most important things we need to do as an approach to understand the dataset better Almost all data analytics or data science professionals do this process before generating insights or doing data modeling In real life this process took a lot of time depending on the complexity and completeness of the dataset we have Of course more variables make us explore more to get the summary we need before doing the next steps Thats why using R or Python the most common programming language to do data analysis some packages help to do that process faster and easier but not better Why not better Because it only shows us a summary before we focus to explore deeper any variables we find interesting In R we can use these libraries In Python we can use these libraries Lets try each library listed above to know what they look like and how they can help us do exploratory data analysis In this post I will use the iris dataset which is common to be used to learn how to code in R or Python In R you can use this code to load the iris dataset In Python you can use this code to load the iris dataset First we need to execute the simple code below From the first snapshot Image 3 we already get a lot of information about the iris dataset From the second snapshot Image 4 From the third snapshot Image 5 Based on the data report above created using dataMaid in R we already get a lot of information regarding the iris dataset only by executing a oneline code First we need to execute the simple code below From the first until the sixth snapshot Images 6 7 8 9 10 11 the information we got was not much different from the previous package From the seventh snapshot Image 12 we got the QQ plot for each numerical variable in the iris dataset From the eighth snapshot Image 13 we got the correlation matrix for each variable in the iris dataset We can see some information such as The ninth snapshot Image 14 using principal component analysis PCA provides the percentage of the variance explained by principal components with a note that labels indicate the cumulative percentage of explained variance it shows 62 the higher the better For the explanation of PCA I think I need another post for this The tenth snapshot Image 15 provides the relative importance of each variable it shows that PetalLength has the highest importance which is almost 05 followed by PetalWidth and so on First we need to execute the simple code below From Images 16 17 18 23 and 24 the information we got was not much different from the previous package From Image 19 shows us the density plot of each variable including the skewness and kurtosis measurement which is used to tell us whether the data is normally distributed or not The explanation of skewness and kurtosis also needs another post I guess From Image 20 21 and 22 shows us the scatter plot between numerical variables available in the iris dataset which is telling us the correlation visually It gives us similar information to the correlation matrix which is in numeric format Using the three packages above we got a lot of information about the iris dataset much faster than we trying to create it manually but its not enough thats why I said in the title faster and easier because it only gives us a glimpse of the iris dataset but at least it gives us which things we can start to working on rather than looking for starting point such as First we need to execute the simple code below Mostly it shows similar information I will try to mention some information that is quite different from previous packages First we need to execute the simple code below The output of this package is very different from previous packages in terms of how to use it the content is quite similar but it makes us can explore better First we need to execute the simple code below Using this package the UI and UX are very different please enjoy the show First we need to execute the simple code below Using the code above some tabs are generated in the browser The new things that we can see using this package Using the four packages above we got a lot of information about the iris dataset not too much difference compared to R packages but still when having more perspective is usually better than having less perspective Some notes It depends I think we can cut the time we need to do EDA is already a good thing Lets try to explore each package explained above and use it wisely not as the main solution In my humble opinion exploring the data should be the fun part of data analysis so dont be afraid to get dirty by doing the EDA manually sometimes the nonautomated method is still the best Woah Ive just realized this post contains 43 images If you reach this point Im grateful that you want to read and learn about how to automate the EDA process through my post I hope you enjoy this post and learn how to use it in your journey as a data analyticsscience professional I am learning to write mistakes are unavoidable

Ditching Pandas at this stage is a better way to use other tools designed specifically for fast IO . The solution is to ditch Pandas .

metrics let you assess the performance of machine learning models but there are so many of them each one has its own benefits and drawbacks and selecting an evaluation metric that works for your problem can sometimes be really tricky In this article you will learn about a bunch of common and lesserknown evaluation metrics and charts to understand how to choose the model performance metric for your problem Simply put a classification metric is a number that measures the performance that your machinelearning model when it comes to assigning observations to certain classes Binary classification is a particular situation where you just have two classes positive and negative Typically the performance is presented on a range from 0 to 1 though not always where a score of 1 is reserved for the perfect model The performance matrix is specific to binary classification problems Lets assume you have a dataset like this Here y is the actual output and ŷ is the predicted output Can we come up with a conclusion as to what is the accuracy of this specific model We can use a performance Matrix to calculate the accuracy called a confusion matrix Well it is a performance measurement for machine learning classification problems where the output can be two or more classes It is a table with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values First we can create a confusion matrix for this First of all we can calculate the possible outputs for the given dataset This is the result Now lets create the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy This is what we call a Confusion Matrix Using this Confusion Matrix we need to find out the accuracy of this Model These 2 boxesPink color give us the right output Now we can get the accuracy using this equation to the above example Always your model should try to reduce False Negative and False Positive values As an example a machine learning model is trained to predict tumors in patients The test dataset consists of 100 people True Positive TP the model correctly predicts the positive class prediction and actual both are positive In the above example 10 people who have tumors are predicted positively by the modelTrue Negative TN the model correctly predicts the negative class prediction and actual both are negative In the above example 60 people who dont have tumors are predicted negatively by the modelFalse Positive FP model gives the wrong prediction of the negative class predictedpositive actualnegative In the above example 22 people are predicted as positive for having a tumor although they dont have a tumor FP is also called a TYPE I errorFalse Negative FN model wrongly predicts the positive class predictednegative actualpositive In the above example 8 people who have tumors are predicted as negative FN is also called a TYPE II error With the help of these four values we can calculate the True Positive Rate TPR False Negative Rate FPR True Negative Rate TNR and False Negative Rate FNR If we have an imbalanced dataset it will affect the algorithmAs an example if you have 1s and 0s and you have 0s more than 1s like 1000 0s and 200 1s And you will get accuracy for 0s 10001000200 1000 1200 8333 This is a good accuracy But your data are imbalancedbiased So we should not depend on the accuracy only when we calculate the performance of the imbalanced dataset There are some other terminologies that can be used Precision means out of all the predicted positive values how many of them have been truly predicted as true positives In this particular scenario our aim is to reduce False PositiveFP We can denote this by an equation As an example in the Spam Classification if any spam mail remains undetected false negative it is okay but what if we miss any critical mail because it is classified as spam False positive In this situation a False Positive should be as low as possible Here precision is more vital as compared to recall Recall means out of all actual true positive values how many of them have been predicted as true positives In this particular scenario our aim is to reduce False NegativeFN We can name recall as True Positivity and Sensitivity We can denote this as an equation As an example we do not want to miss any cancer patients Therefore we want the false negative to be as low as possibleIf a person does not have cancer and the model predicts that he has cancerFalse Positive This is okay that person can do a test and check whether he has cancer or not But if a person has cancer but the model predicts as not a cancer patientFalse Negative is not good we need to reduce that In these situations we can compromise with the low precision but recall should be high If you need to consider Precision and Recall both at the same time you can use FScore It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall Here in FScore you have 3 different formulas F1 Score Here the focus is on both False positives and False negatives and both important F05 Score Here False positive is more important than Flase negative F2 Score Here False negative is more important than Flase positive β is the deciding parameter to pick the correct formula for FScore Confusion matrix precision recall and Fscore provide better insights into the prediction as compared to accuracy performance metrics This is all about Binary Classification Metrics and see

It can be used to predict the probability of an event such as whether an incoming email is spam or not . It is typically used as a binary classifier by choosing a threshold value usually 05 and classifying inputs with probability greater than the threshold as the positive class . In this article we will discuss the logistic regression model in depth implement it from scratch in Python and then show its implementation in ScikitLearn .

youve heard on every web 3 podcast newscast broadcast and written anything Lets be honest here youre ultimately in charge of your financial future this is true even if you employ a personal financial advisor Id add So how do you DYOR properly Well Im happy to announce were working on the next iteration of FlourishingAI which will extend its auto trading and provide user DYOR which are truly easy to use and help drive confident action rather than analysis paralysis Until then heres my handy guide for DYOR on any digital asset youre considering purchasing If youre new to crypto and want to get smart about researching web 3 this guides for you Start your journey with big and established currencies such as Bitcoin Ethereum and BNB While volatile high trading volumes make these the safest investments in the space Net read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos to understand the basics Skip the programming parts unless youre into that By the time youre done youll understand wallets addresses private and public keys and how blockchains work 2 Understand the Problem and Ascertain if the Project Solution is Viable Read the Website and Whitepaper Focus on two things whether the project looks credible and the problems the project is trying to solve Ask yourself if the problem is worth solving Then determine if it makes sense to introduce blockchain technology to solve the specified problems Finally figure out if the teams offering is substantially better than available alternatives be they crypto based or not Run a SWOT analysis Anything not solving a problem is speculative oh hello SHIB Check the projects socials what youre looking for is not too frequent updates indicating theyre only working on marketing or too few indicating slow advancement 3 Understand the Tokenomics Is it a token A coin Know the difference Does the project build on an existing chain or does it have its own blockchain how are tokens issued and have a few early holders amassed a large concentration of the token already Such concentration could be problematic if so since the token will move a lot if a few people make moves Also determine the consensus algorithm of the chain a crypto project uses and the extent of centralization or decentralization The former isnt necessarily bad look at unstoppable domains but there should be a good reason to centralize Otherwise decentralization should be preferred Finally understand what exchanges theyre listed on as a listing on an exchange centralized or decentralized which is too small increases risk substantially 4 Understand the Team Is the team anonymous An anon team doesnt necessarily make a project a scam or rug pull but a public team does point to confidence and transparency Does the team have a background which makes the team suitable to handle the problem in step 1 Do a bit of digging on platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter to verify persons behind the project Then reach out to the team and ask them your questions Any team who truly believes in their mission will talk incessantly about it our team and our community cant shut up about making crypto accessible for new holders for instance 5 Join a Holder Community Going it alone virtually guarantees failure Try joining a community such as FlourishingAIs community where there is data driven respectful discussion of tokens and coins Look for maturity of participants and the maturity of the discussion Avoid overly hyper discussions or groups where discussion is overly loaded with memes or with repetitive posts which is usually a good indicator of bots which are employed to provide the illusion of community Also look for a projects partners a strong project will attract other strong projects which are happy to partner to create synergy Trite but true you are the sum of your five closest friends The same is kind of true for projects Ok the above five research goals in place Ill end with a few final thoughts Not all the information will be of the same quality or trustworthiness While you should consider all available info place more credibility on a press release media coverage or partner announcement than a random tweet or reddit thread When in doubt consider motivations of the writer Consider the relevance and importance of the data Again not all news is created equal Coindesk and Decrypt are more relevant than press releases or project tweets Another example news of a data breach or safety issue regarding your investment is massively more important than a new planned feature DYOR takes time Dont rush it These are JUST the basics I could write dozens of pages but Ill keep it to the above five reference points which alone put you ahead of the pack And stay tuned because while DYOR takes time FlourishingAI will automate and speed up much of this soon May you always Flourish,4868, Not Financial Advice and DYOR are standard messages youve heard on every web 3 podcast newscast broadcast and written anything . FlourishAI is working on the next iteration of FlourishingAI which will extend its auto trading and provide user DyOR which are truly easy to use and help drive confident action .

The simple answer is that its profitable to do so . Over the course of the mortgage you will pay a rate that will be below inflation .

252,https://medium.com/getdelta/crypto-roundup-november-20th-e01e11e5d6f0?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,Major crypto developments for the week Bitcoin ordinals see resurgence Over the last two weeks weve seen a major resurgence in activity around Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions which are onchain inscriptions of text images audio and video natively on the Bitcoin blockchain The chart below shows the percentage of Bitcoins overall fees that are made up by inscriptions which is now at the highest level since the initial ordinals frenzy earlier this year What are the implications of this for the Bitcoin network and market Higher demand to utilize Bitcoin blockspace means higher transaction fees that must be provided to incentive miners to include transactions in a block While this may not be ideal for a network user looking to conduct small transactions this is good for miner revenues and increased mining activity which ultimately translates to more security for the Bitcoin network and its holder base It will be interesting to see if ordinals can continue their growth and how they will hold up relative to NFTs on Ethereum Solana and other smart contract platforms Past performance is not an indication of future results JPMorgan utilizes Avalanche blockchain One major development that came out this week was the collaboration between JPMorgans Onyx and Apollo Global to test a portfolio management program on Avalanche connected by LayerZeros cross chain technology This proofofconcept will showcase bringing the wealth management industry onchain The collaboration under the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be entitled Project Guardian and according to the projects website aims to test the feasibility of applications in asset tokenization and DeFi while managing risks to financial stability and integrity Blackrock officially files ETH ETF One big piece of news came as Blackrock the largest digital asset manager officially filed for an Ethereum ETF exchange traded fund in partnership with iShares This should come as no surprise as last week we highlighted that Blackrock had filed for a trust entity in Delaware for this official filling If approved the ETF will be listed on the Nasdaq and utilize Coinbase as the designated custodian This marks a continued push into the digital asset space from the financial giant HODLers trend continues Bitcoin that hasnt moved in at least a year sets record high of 70 This week marked a fairly significant milestone for Bitcoin as over 70 of Bitcoin supply has now not been moved in at least a year for the first time in its history This supports previous data points that weve highlighted to reflect the strong belief from Bitcoins holder base in the wake of crypto wide contagion and macro headwinds after its alltime highs in 2021 While higher prices will ultimately incentivize new sellers with Bitcoin up over 100 in the same time period it appears Bitcoin holders are not planning on offloading inventory at these price levels or any time soon Past performance is not an indication of future results ProBitcoin president elected in Argentina One of the biggest global headlines this week came as Javier Milei was elected as president of Argentina Outspoken as a liberation that strongly opposes central banks Milei plans to dollarize Argentina but has spoken very positively Bitcoin While there is reason to believe he may implement positive Bitcoin policies time will tell and given how vocal he has been about plans to dollarize the country may not be quite as strong of a force for Bitcoin as some Bitcoin commentators have suggested dYdX undergoes potential insurance fund exploit Overshadowing the announcement that all fees from dydX v4 would go to stakers an attack on the protocols insurance fund took place this week The attacker did this by taking massive leveraged long positions on YFI driving up open interest from 08 million to 67 million in just a few days thereby making FYI open interest higher than any other perpetual venue in crypto Meanwhile a large amount of YFI spot selling triggered a liquidation cascade on dYdX which dYdX was unable to liquidate efficiently and was ultimately forced to cover the losses of up to 9 million of the dYdX v3 insurance fund It is unclear exactly if the same actor was on both the dYdX perpetual and spot side of the events but there is reason to believe this may have been a targeted attack on dYdXs insurance fund According to dYdX founder Antonio Juliano the organization has contacted the FBI

283,https://medium.com/@warnermediaent/sitting-in-the-directors-chair-for-the-first-time-8f6f5bef86?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,As Executive Producer Sydney Fleischmann prepared for the fourth and final season of Room 104 HBOs anthology series from the Duplass Brothers she decided to shift gears a bit Since the series debuted in 2017 Fleischmann has served as an integral part of the producing team As the show blossomed she grew with it graduating from a logistical producer to overseeing the shows creative vision alongside Mark Duplass Heading into the last season of the show Fleischmann dared herself to give directing a go The final episode of the series marks her directorial debut Below the 30yearold accomplished producer reflects on her experience putting on her directors hat for the first time her interpretation of the finale and whats in store for her after Room 104 ends What was it like to have your directorial debut be the season finale FLEISCHMANN Directing was the best thing I think Ive done on the show I had never really thought about directing an episode because weve just had such incredible directors I think theyve all set the bar really high and it never quite felt right At the core of the episode its about a person at the end of his life reflecting back and thinking about decisions he made and decisions he wasnt allowed to make I have two 92yearold grandfathers both of whom Im close with one of whom Im very close with This episode is definitely not my grandfathers story but as I was preparing to direct it I thought a lot about conversations Ive had with him about how he views his life and the things he wishes he had done things he wishes he hadnt done Its a really profound thing to be able to look at your own mortality that way and look back on the whole story of your life I think when I read the script thats what I thought of and it really resonated with me I knew I wanted to direct this one Mark Duplass was as usual incredibly supportive The whole crew was super supportive I dont think I could have done it without the people who work on this show because I trust them so deeply I think thats such a huge part of doing anything creative having that trust and knowing you can be vulnerable and make mistakes Its comforting knowing people wont write you off for it but that they will help you get through the challenging moments and help you solve the problems And so directing the finale felt like a collaboration It was a really special experience to see the show from a different angle Ive seen it from the producer angle for 48 episodes and watched other directors direct It was a very illuminating experience to step into that role myself The daughter says a line in the finale about how motels are places people stay on their way to somewhere else They werent home but at least they were safe with people they loved How did you decide to end the series with this line We shoot the episodes in a totally different order We shoot them in a way that makes sense for production taking actors schedules and directors schedules into account And then when we finish editing them we look at all of the episodes and we say What order does it make sense to air them in This episode was not originally written as the finale but when we started arranging the puzzle pieces of the series it became clear itd make the perfect ending to the series because it hits on the entire meaning of this motel room It makes a statement about what motels are and what without being too dramatic what the human experience is Whats next for you Are you planning to take on more producer roles Is directing something you want to keep doing Im definitely producing Im developing a couple projects right now that well hopefully get to shoot at some point There was something really special about the environment in which I got to direct on this show I think for me that was such a big part of it to have this really safe space to do it I would definitely be open to directing again in that way with people I love and trust which I guess is what anybody wants Looking back do you have any favorite episodes from the past four seasons I think the one I really connected with in season two was the episode called Josie and Me We made it at a time when I was trying to understand my own journey and how I would perceive my younger self at that moment Thats what the story is about a young woman following her collegeaged self throughout the course of a night I definitely relate to the story in terms of how you view yourself throughout time and how and why we rewrite our own histories That one is definitely special to me I think the content of it challenged me to think about something differently than I had before What do you hope people take away from Room 104 as the series comes to a close That is a good question I think the takeaway is that theres space for everyone I hope we did a decent job of creating space for more people to tell their stories I think thats really important to just know that there is space for all perspectives For other filmmakers a good takeaway is to work within limitations and aim to set those for yourselves Its more satisfying creatively to create something when you have restrictions,5116, Sydney Fleischmann is Executive Producer of the fourth and final

submissions five short films were selected to screen at the 23rd annual HBO Short Film Competition at this years American Black Film Festival The festival will be hosted on ABFFcom from August 2130 with more than 100000 virtual attendees from around the globe anticipated to attend As part of this years Short Film Competition emerging writers and directors presented narratives that ranged from gutwrenching tragedies to subversive comedies and a journey into selfexploration Letia Solomon is a Los Angelesbased filmmaker who is a champion for underrepresented voices and hopes to inspire the next generation of artists Below Letia explains how her personal experiences helped create The Cypher Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFFs HBO Short Film Competition ABFF and its longstanding HBO Competition have featured so many outstanding films in the past It was always one of my top goals as a filmmaker to apply The entire team is thrilled and we are honored for The Cypher to be featured in the 2020 HBO Competition What inspired you to transition from your career as an engineer into filmmaking It took about four years of soul searching and trial and error to figure it all out The turning point was in 2015 when one of my previous films really resonated with this 14yearold girl at a film festival The film focused on a young Black teen competing in a robotics competition to gain scholarship money for college She came up to me afterwards and said she saw herself in my character and plans to be the first person in her family to go to college I often volunteered with the youth programs in STEM Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics but none of it moved me in the same way as hearing this young girl commit to her dreams after watching my film She solidified my why and confirmed that my perspective on storytelling matters I also realized that project management and problem solving fit perfectly well in filmmaking since were constantly solving problems Whether its on set story development or in postproduction these critical thinking skills are transferable and will enhance the final project Do you feel that your experiences working in a different industry prior to entertainment gives you a unique filmmaking perspective How so Absolutely Working in Aerospace as an African American female engineer provided privileges and setbacks that were crucial in adapting to film I gained access as being the only Black woman in the room but I also had to work twice as hard to be heard and gain the same amount of respect The same thing occurred while studying Chemical Engineering in undergrad at a predominantly white institute therefore the work ethic was cultivated well before film Ive also had wonderful women mentors that have experienced love life and loss while still showing up as incredible managers executive leadership and seniorlevel engineers Working in a different industry taught me leadership project management patience and communication skills The passion and drive for storytelling was always there however film school provided the technical and creative tools to help bring these stories to life What inspired you to direct this story I was drawn to direct due to my love for hiphop the vivid landscape Wes created and my desire to champion this young mans journey of selfacceptance As an African American woman I know what it feels like to be marginalized and felt that I had a strong perspective in showcasing our male counterparts I also have friends and a dear family member that has gone through a similar experience and knew it was time to share this nuanced story on screen How has being a member of the LGBTQIA hiphop community changed over the last several years Is there still the same stigma The diverse representation of male and female emcees has definitely progressed over the years however the change is slower for mainstream hiphop We can count with our fingers the numbers of mainstream queer rap artists that are widely popular with a large following With respect to battle rap the numbers get smaller due to the hypermasculine or aggressive nature of the environment Battle rap is a platform for real raw lyricists to use anything they have to win Theres a rich complex history and relationship between the hiphop and LGTBQIA communities that cannot be solved with

310,https://medium.com/invisible-illness/could-going-keto-help-your-mental-health-5b0fe0d58c32?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,Originally created in 1921 to help epilepsy treatment in children the ketogenic diet has its origins in helping improve neurological health Since its invention scientists have found it helpful for Alzheimers Parkinsons and many other neurological conditions Since then it has also become a fad diet among many health and wellness influencers Touted for its ability to suppress hunger and stabilize blood sugar the ketogenic diet is one that is rising in popularity among many fitness enthusiasts and dieters There is growing research to show that the ketogenic diet is also beneficial for brain health and stabilizing neurotransmitters in the body helping to regulate mood and improve symptoms for many psychiatric patients In case you have been hiding for the last decade the ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein but gains the majority of its nutrition from fats like avocados and coconut oil The goal of a ketogenic diet is to be in a state of ketosis In other words your body is no longer using glucose for its fuel but ketones instead That means that your blood glucose levels stay very low on average around 60 to 85 mgdl That usually means that carbohydrates and proteins are kept relatively low Some people find the diet too restrictive and that is a deterrent for them in using this diet as a treatment plan Some people have tried to use the dietary ketone supplements to shortcut actually maintaining a restrictive diet but the higher carbs and proteins can interfere with the benefits In 2021 a metaanalysis of brain disorders and the ketogenic diet was created They were able to compare the results from 14 different observational studies about using a ketogenic diet for different mental and neurological conditions Due to the small number of studies and the small number of participants in each study the results were not definitive There was however a positive association for the participants who were able to stay on the diet longterm As stated above many participants gave up the diet early on due to the restrictive nature of the plan One of the reasons that the ketogenic diet may be helpful is the increase in GABA and glutamate production in the body Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that helps increase mood Glutamate turns into GABA in the body Some research has shown that the ketogenic diet can balance glutamate and GABA helping to calm down the brain This can be helpful for many brainrelated issues Disorders like anxiety epilepsy and Parkinsons for example all struggle with overexcitability of the brain Another reason keto can help with mood disorders and neurological conditions is due to the blood sugar balancing Someone who has insulin resistance has double the odds of developing major depressive disorder than an individual who does not have insulin resistance Blood sugar dysregulation has a profound effect on the brain A third reason has to do with mitochondrial function In case you dont remember from high school biology the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell Sugar consumption has a negative effect on mitochondria Consuming sugar may decrease the effectiveness of the mitochondria The brain requires a lot of energy to function properly if you have ever had a mentally draining day you may find you are hungrier at the end than if you had been physically active That is because the brain needs so much energy If the mitochondria are disabled then it would mean higher levels of brain fog as well as decreasing other functions This is a highly restrictive diet There are people who should not attempt this method of treatment People who struggle with disordered eating did not seem to show much improvement on the ketogenic diet alone and adding more restrictions to the diet may be triggering to individuals who struggle with already restricted eating Individuals who struggle with fat consumption including but not limited to those who have gallbladder concerns or have their gallbladder removed may struggle with this diet As with any new diet change it would be important to talk with your primary care doctor before beginning a diet like the ketogenic diet Many videos and articles are out there discussing the ketogenic diet Back when I was into Facebook groups years ago I found groups called lazy keto and the like These groups and videos encourage individuals to eat imitation sugarladen foods high amounts of saturated fats in bacon and butter and mayonnaise and low levels of phytochemicalrich fruits and vegetables It is important to maintain a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for support in the gut as well as for antioxidant help with eliminating free radicals in the body If you are going to try a ketogenic diet make sure that you get the majority of the carbs that you are consuming from fiberrich fruits and vegetables in order to achieve the best health benefits This site has a list of ketogenicfriendly fruits and vegetables There are many lowcarb plant foods full of phytonutrients that are great for a ketogenic diet If you are the kind of person who needs a premade meal plan this site has a beginnerfriendly plan for starting the ketogenic

20 of the US population suffers from a chronic anxiety condition about the same number of people struggle with some kind of chronic pain condition I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks as long as I can remember I remember laying on the floor in fetal position wishing my parents would just hug me while I felt this outofcontrol heart racing that would make me feel so scared Also for as long as I can remember I struggled with shoulder pain I remember in my late teens getting shopping carts at stores I was only browsing at because my purse would cause my shoulder Over the years I have noticed a connection between my physical pain and anxiety concerns Days when my pain is worse I have noticed I am more anxious When I have a higherlevel pain day I notice that anxiety seems to increase as well Pain and anxiety go hand in hand Often it seems that one is not found without the other Many people who suffer from chronic pain and chronic anxiety find that they cannot tell which one started first There is a phenomenon called the pain cycle where the pain one experiences causes a reaction in the body muscle tightening and guarding decreased movement and then atrophy of the muscles The decrease mobility contributes to more anxiety and emotional distress The cycle continues until it is corrected In reality the cycle can be started at any point in the loop You may have an injury that resulted in loss of motion and caused muscle atrophy the muscle guarding that physicality in your body can lead to your brain perceiving an imminent threat and increasing feelings of anxiety It could also be that it begins with anxiety that causes muscle tension muscle guarding decrease movement and then that increases pain sensations in the body Not only can the causes be one or the other but the perception of pain is also dependent on anxiety levels as well The regions for pain and anxiety in the brain are overlapping This means that the brain reads both in a similar way One example is this doubleblind study which showed that people reacted less severely to social rejection The participants who consumed a pain reliever seemed less bothered by not being chosen to play a game than the participants who received a placebo That would indicate that the opposite is also true If people who have heightened pain may have heightened anxiety and those who have heightened anxiety may also have higher pain levels That is not to say that we should all consume acetaminophen daily or at all for anxiety it is an interesting finding that may help us better understand the connection between anxiety and pain Chronic pain as well as chronic anxiety conditions can mean that this loop is constantly cycling through For people with chronic conditions this cycle may be worse when one or the other parts of the loop are worse For example lets say you have chronic knee pain It was caused by an injury several years ago and most days it is manageable But on this particular day you also have a huge deadline that is looming over you from work As you start going through your day you notice that the knee is hurting more that day as well The addition of the extra stress will increase the anxiety and cause more significant pain reactions and thus cause the whole cycle to be increased The perception of the pain increased but the injury did not The reverse is true as well on a day that you have a positive thing happening lets say a party you are excited to attend you may have a lessened perception of the pain in the injury The common denominator in this is the nervous system In both pain as well as anxiety responses the brain goes to fight or flight The brain is attempting to protect itself In acute situations that may be helpful In chronic pain and anxiety conditions people become conditioned to adjusting their behavior to avoid the painful stimuli and that can increase the pain as well Knowing the connection is just the beginning and to some extent this is good news It means that you can find relief in both areas by beginning to treat one Ultimately managing chronic conditions like pain and anxiety is a lifelong commitment It requires a change in your lifestyle and a dedication to getting to know what works for your individual body as well The suggestions above are not a substitution for medical care If you are experiencing chronic pain and chronic anxiety it is important to be under the care of a medical professional to help you manage the condition Finding ways to decrease either the pain or the anxiety can be incredibly helpful in maintaining a quality of life that we all want and aspire to No one deserves to live a life of pain either emotional or physical,4697, Approximately 20 of the US population suffers from a chronic anxiety condition about the same number of people struggle with some kind of chronic pain condition .

if they need it Hypermasculine jobs which oftentimes are more psychologically damaging and traumatic than average project the biggest overtly gendered bias about therapy and therefore make it less likely that men who may suffer from trauma due to their job stress and experiences are less likely to receive help for it What can sometimes end up happening when men are dealing with mental health struggles in order to avoid the stigma associated with mental healthcare among their peers is that they turn their frustrations and shame on their family members We saw this with the increase of domestic violence issues during the pandemic This last June during mens health awareness month a friend of mine lost her father to the tragedy of suicide He had spent years fighting thoughts of ending his life and finally just before Fathers Day lost his battle to depression Men are more likely to be in jobs that carry inherent risk to mental health Jobs like military firefighters and police are filled with situations that can lead to ptsd and other anxietyrelated concerns For the last 20 years my own spouse has been a police officer and though he is thankfully in therapy himself constantly struggles with his hypervigilance and need for control to be safe Things like where we sit in a restaurant and when we go to a movie have become routine in our relationship He has had so many times over the last 20 years feeling inadequate and out of control because of the fear he has built up from the experiences he has had In our current society specifically in the United States as that is the place I live and am familiar with mens mental health has been minimized stigmatized and understudied Because of the lack of attention and research given to mens mental health we dont know very much about the social structures of men and how they can use their social interactions to help their mental health In a selfreported analysis some men reported that they used their intimate partners as their primary means of working through their emotional needs This created a public image of the masculine ideal that society has placed on them while still managing their own emotional needs The big issue that could come from using your intimate partner as your sole emotional outlet is that it may eventually overwhelm your partner It would be difficult for one person to be the sole emotional support system for anyone If the partner is also caring for small children or their own mental health concerns that will diminish the capability they have to assist the man in need I am not proposing that men become women I am suggesting that men start to destigmatize emotional support for each other In whatever way that feels natural for men I am not a man I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of masculine relationships and friendships I do know that something needs to change Men need emotional connection and our society is becoming less and less connected If the only friendship interaction men have is playing violent video games on Twitch streams I do not see that bettering the stigma about emotional health If we start to create a narrative for men that it is safe to reach out safe to interact with others and talk about their emotional health that may be a way to reach men and start to change the culture about mental health for men Mens mental health affects us all We cannot thrive as a society if half the population is failing to thrive We are only as strong as our weakest players and that means we all need to prioritize mens mental health We can start to shift the narrative as women talking to men about therapy taking our sons emotional needs seriously listening to their feelings without bias We can start to demand therapy from our partners and significant others We need to destigmatize men who go to therapy and start rewarding them Showing the other men that women dont want that strong silent type anymore We want the emotionally mature and compassionate type We want men who have faced their shame and trauma and have healed We want men who are emotionally physically and mentally safe And that only comes with working through the difficult emotional and mental health junk,5008, Currently in America today there are over 6 million men suffering from depression and 143 of men are struggling with some level of anxiety . Men seem more likely to accept their mental health concerns as a personality trait or mask their symptoms in lieu of getting any kind of mental health care . Men are often taught that only weak men need to get therapy in their social circles or made to feel that they are bad at being a man if they need it .

This discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today . Embeddings sit at the core of models like ChatGPT and almost all progress made in AI can be traced down one way or another to these elements .

Israel just makes it easier to notice but harder to talk about openly in a world where secular people still believe they can sweep these problems under a rug .

440,https://medium.com/@juanky006/5-tech-jobs-you-should-consider-in-2023-62275442b1cf?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,This blog post is about 5 tech careers you should consider starting right after you graduate from college or if you are planning to change jobs in 2023 Most computer science college students dont know what to do after graduation They usually think their only responsibility at the moment is to take classes and if they get good grades they will get the job they want without any problem It is not so easy People wanting to change careers often wonder what they should do There are so many options nowadays that it seems really hard to decide what you want to do In this article I want to help those college students and people who want to change careers make a decision My goal is to explain what these careers are about so people are able to choose the one they like A frontend developer is someone who builds user interfaces He or she spends time developing the components that allow users to interact with applications For instance they create buttons tables dropdowns and menus that allow the user to navigate an application game or website It is a fun position to work in as you can see the immediate results of your contribution and you can work on making things look good The skills you need to be a frontend developer vary depending on the company you want to work in But a safe bet is to learn HTML CSS JavaScript and frameworks like React It is a challenging position not as easy as people think but it is definitely easier to grasp than other roles like firmware engineer for example What I like the most about this career is that you can immediately see the effects of your creations I love making user interfaces look pretty and I always judge a product based on its user experience If you are like me I would recommend you choose this career for when you graduate or if you want to start in the tech field Frontend developers build the visual aspect of a website Backend developers build the machinery behind a website They build what users cannot see databases security protocols serverside operations and API endpoints College students should consider this position as a lot of the work will do in a computer science degree involves backend development In college you will learn things like Java C SQL Python and Linux You will also learn useful skills from courses such as cyber security API and databases so I would recommend you take advantage of that As for people trying to change careers backend development is harder to grasp than frontend because you have to use harder languages or technologies than JavaScript or HTML Here you deal with Java and multiple services to send data to clients Therefore I recommend this one mostly to computer science students who will spend 4 years learning these skills Data analysts are people who use data to help a business in decisionmaking They gather data with programming find patterns create charts and present their findings with a presentation Data analysts are valuable as they allow a business to understand its customers and make more informed decisions A data analyst will help a business determine what they are doing well and what they arent For example data analysts can gather data on the usage of a business website and define its shortcomings or features users dont like This position is for people who love working with data and finding patterns To me this is a fun career You get data from a website clean it and process it Then you create charts and draw your conclusions so you can present them to your coworkers Not only that but it can be an introductory field for more complex areas like machine learning Information security analysts are people who work to gather information about the security mechanisms that protect a companys data For instance an information security analyst will work on gathering data about firewalls to strengthen them they will also work on seeing if the software is up to date to prevent a data breach They look at possible vulnerabilities in their system and try to strengthen them Cyber security will be one of the most indemand fields in the next decade as a lot of things will revolve around technologies like artificial intelligence networks and databases You dont want these machines to be hacked by an evil person or the results could be catastrophic Imagine someone steals the data at one of Googles data centers That would be bad and if you choose this field you can help prevent it Finally a database administrator is a person in charge of managing a databases operation and security Some of the responsibilities of a database administrator include keeping databases up to date and creating a backup for the data As a database administrator you will be able to work in many places from tech companies to banks Almost every company nowadays gathers tons of data and they need somewhere to store it Consequently they need someone to manage the place where they store that data This is where database administrators come in Thank you That was a blog post about 5 tech careers

446,https://medium.com/@juanky006/asynchronous-javascript-made-simple-4feb1c701092?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,Understand what asynchronous code means Photo by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash While on your JavaScript journey you might have heard multiple terms I can guarantee you that one of those you heard the most was asynchronous JavaScript but what it is and how does it help in web development Asynchronous JavaScript is a technique in which code is designed to execute in a nonblocking manner meaning when a specific type of code runs other code is allowed to run Asynchronous code operates in the background and communicates with other parts of the program using callback functions or Promises There are several ways to write asynchronous JavaScript code including using the async and await keywords as well as using Promises For example you can use the setTimeout function to execute a callback function after a specified amount of time has passed In this example the consolelog will be executed after 3000 milliseconds 3 seconds have passed This allows other code to continue running in the meantime rather than being blocked by the setTimeout function If you run it you will see the add gets printed first which means it executed while the other function was running Asynchronous JavaScript is often used in situations where data needs to be loaded or fetched from an external source such as a server or database By using asynchronous techniques the program can continue to run while the data is being fetched rather than being blocked until the data is available This can help to improve the performance and responsiveness of the program This is especially important in JavaScript where the web experience has to be smooth If the code was blocked while making a call to an API then the website might get stuck and the user would be waiting for the call to finish to do a certain action One way to execute asynchronous code in JavaScript is with promises which is an object that allows you to write asynchronous code while looking synchronous Promises have three states pending fulfilled and rejected As you can imagine if I make a request to an API I will get fulfilled state if the request was successful rejected if it was not and pending while it is being processed You can use the then method of a Promise to specify what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled or rejected The then method takes two arguments a callback function for the fulfilled case and a callback function for the rejected case Here the Promise succeeds after the add function finishes executing and the value it accepts is the result of the add function In this case 3 shows in the console Promises are very useful because they are very readable thanks to the then and catch methods The then method allows you to chain promises together and whatever happens in one Promise will be used for the subsequent Promise Finally the catch method allows you to handle any errors that may occur during the asynchronous operation This happens when a promise is rejected The true power of a promise can be seen when you fetch an API In this code the function formatUrlwill make the url match the format required by my example API After that it will fetch the data parse it into JSON and finally print it to the console All while not blocking the other code being readable and having a segment that catches errors the catch statement See how readable and smooth it looks And with this we conclude this introduction to asynchronous JavaScript Hope you liked it and subscribe for more quality content JavaScript Promises with w3schools httpswwww3schoolscomjsjs_promiseasp MDN tutorial on Promises httpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobal_ObjectsPromise Web Dev Simplified Promises tutorial httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvDHvZLI7Db8Et488s,3710, Asynchronous JavaScript is a technique in which code is designed to execute in a nonblocking manner meaning when a specific type of code runs other code is allowed to run . Asynchronous code operates in the background and communicates with other parts of the program using callback functions or Promises . Promises are very useful because they are very readable thanks to the then and catch methods .

Firefighting crews shifted resources to California to attend to four blazes over 100,000 acres .

where flow analysis could not safely determine when or how a field might change In the case of field promotion on a class for example it could be an issue if a subclass overrides a field with a getter which sometimes returns null In Dart 32 weve improved our flow analysis engine and are now able to type promote private final fields Now the code snippet above passes without errors This leverages the understanding that for a private final field the value never changes after the initial assignment so checking it just once is considered safe Private final field promotion is available starting with Dart 32 and will be applied to projects that have a Dart SDK lower bound of 32 or higher Speaking of code analysis weve also made a number of improvements to our standard code analysis rules in packagelints This package contains the default recommended set of static analysis rules that comes with any new project created by dart create or flutter create via packageflutter_lints an extension of packagelints A new major version of this lint set version 30 is now available This revision added six lints to the core set and two lints to the recommended set It features lints for validating pubspec URLs validating that collection methods are invoked with the correct arguments and more For the full list of changes check out the changelog Version 30 will be the default for new projects in the coming release For existing projects you can upgrade now Multiplatform support across a wide range of platforms has always been a core principle of Dart But even though a line of Dart code can run unchanged across all those platforms large apps still often have a need to interop with existing code That could mean code from older projects or APIs available in other libraries or system APIs Weve made a number of investments in this area starting with FFI for interop with native C APIs Were currently working on expanding this to support interop with Java and Kotlin and Objective C and Swift For exciting updates on JS interop check out the Dart web section further down As of Dart 32 weve made a number of improvements to native interop Dart DevTools is a suite of debugging and performance tools that supports both pureDart and Flutter apps In Dart 32 Flutter 316 were announcing a new extensions framework which enables package authors to build custom tooling for their package surfaced directly in DevTools This allows pubdev packages that contain frameworks to offer custom tools specific to their use cases For example the authors of Serverpod have been hard at work building developer tools for their package and are excited to be shipping a DevTools extension in their upcoming 12 release Wasm also known as WebAssembly is an exciting new instruction format for web browsers which provides a portable platformneutral binary code format for execution in modern browsers Highlevel managed languages like Dart use garbage collection which is being added to the Wasm standard As of Chrome 119 garbage collection support for Wasm known as WasmGC is enabled by default WasmGC support is also coming in Firefox 120 their next stable release So whats the status with Dart Flutter and WasmGC The DarttoWasm compiler is almost feature complete The team is very happy with performance and compatibility Our focus now is on edge cases to make sure our output is fast across a broad range of scenarios For Flutter web weve completed a new Skwasm rendering engine To maximize performance Swasm connects the compiled application code directly to a custom CanvasKit Wasm module with a wasmtowasm binding Its also the first iteration of multithreaded rendering support for Flutter web which further improves frame times There are still a few things left before Flutter web with Wasm is ready to graduate out of its current experimental status We are starting to migrate a number of internal projects to packageweb and the new JS interop mechanism and expect to have more updates in the next stable release In the meantime you can get the latest details at our Support for WebAssembly page Thats all we have for today Dart 32 is available now from dartdev or as part of todays Flutter 316 release Until next time have fun with Dart,5049, Dart 32 features a new language feature for nonnull promotion of private final fields . New interop capabilities support for extensions in DevTools and an update on our web roadmap including support for Wasm aka WebAssembly . Dart 32 is available now from dartdev or as part of Flutter 316 .

680,https://medium.com/invisible-illness/could-going-keto-help-your-mental-health-5b0fe0d58c32?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,Originally created in 1921 to help epilepsy treatment in children the ketogenic diet has its origins in helping improve neurological health Since its invention scientists have found it helpful for Alzheimers Parkinsons and many other neurological conditions Since then it has also become a fad diet among many health and wellness influencers Touted for its ability to suppress hunger and stabilize blood sugar the ketogenic diet is one that is rising in popularity among many fitness enthusiasts and dieters There is growing research to show that the ketogenic diet is also beneficial for brain health and stabilizing neurotransmitters in the body helping to regulate mood and improve symptoms for many psychiatric patients In case you have been hiding for the last decade the ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein but gains the majority of its nutrition from fats like avocados and coconut oil The goal of a ketogenic diet is to be in a state of ketosis In other words your body is no longer using glucose for its fuel but ketones instead That means that your blood glucose levels stay very low on average around 60 to 85 mgdl That usually means that carbohydrates and proteins are kept relatively low Some people find the diet too restrictive and that is a deterrent for them in using this diet as a treatment plan Some people have tried to use the dietary ketone supplements to shortcut actually maintaining a restrictive diet but the higher carbs and proteins can interfere with the benefits In 2021 a metaanalysis of brain disorders and the ketogenic diet was created They were able to compare the results from 14 different observational studies about using a ketogenic diet for different mental and neurological conditions Due to the small number of studies and the small number of participants in each study the results were not definitive There was however a positive association for the participants who were able to stay on the diet longterm As stated above many participants gave up the diet early on due to the restrictive nature of the plan One of the reasons that the ketogenic diet may be helpful is the increase in GABA and glutamate production in the body Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that helps increase mood Glutamate turns into GABA in the body Some research has shown that the ketogenic diet can balance glutamate and GABA helping to calm down the brain This can be helpful for many brainrelated issues Disorders like anxiety epilepsy and Parkinsons for example all struggle with overexcitability of the brain Another reason keto can help with mood disorders and neurological conditions is due to the blood sugar balancing Someone who has insulin resistance has double the odds of developing major depressive disorder than an individual who does not have insulin resistance Blood sugar dysregulation has a profound effect on the brain A third reason has to do with mitochondrial function In case you dont remember from high school biology the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell Sugar consumption has a negative effect on mitochondria Consuming sugar may decrease the effectiveness of the mitochondria The brain requires a lot of energy to function properly if you have ever had a mentally draining day you may find you are hungrier at the end than if you had been physically active That is because the brain needs so much energy If the mitochondria are disabled then it would mean higher levels of brain fog as well as decreasing other functions This is a highly restrictive diet There are people who should not attempt this method of treatment People who struggle with disordered eating did not seem to show much improvement on the ketogenic diet alone and adding more restrictions to the diet may be triggering to individuals who struggle with already restricted eating Individuals who struggle with fat consumption including but not limited to those who have gallbladder concerns or have their gallbladder removed may struggle with this diet As with any new diet change it would be important to talk with your primary care doctor before beginning a diet like the ketogenic diet Many videos and articles are out there discussing the ketogenic diet Back when I was into Facebook groups years ago I found groups called lazy keto and the like These groups and videos encourage individuals to eat imitation sugarladen foods high amounts of saturated fats in bacon and butter and mayonnaise and low levels of phytochemicalrich fruits and vegetables It is important to maintain a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for support in the gut as well as for antioxidant help with eliminating free radicals in the body If you are going to try a ketogenic diet make sure that you get the majority of the carbs that you are consuming from fiberrich fruits and vegetables in order to achieve the best health benefits This site has a list of ketogenicfriendly fruits and vegetables There are many lowcarb plant foods full of phytonutrients that are great for a ketogenic diet If you are the kind of person who needs a premade meal plan this site has a beginnerfriendly plan for starting the ketogenic

700,https://medium.com/on-the-couch/7-life-changing-lessons-i-learned-from-failure-ac20571b499a?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,Damn I failed again Whats your problem Nnamdi Will you continue this way Youre intelligent but I really cant tell why you keep failing Its time we thought of something else you can be good at We cant keep making huge sacrifices without seeing good results for our investments My parents were fed up with trying to support me financially through high school I understood their pain but I couldnt seem to do anything about it Academically I struggled to finish high school and needed to move on to the next phaseuniversity But when I sat for the entrance exams during my last year in high school I failed badly I waited for the next year to go for them again It wasnt any better after the second trial I did this five more times and had nature smile at me on my eighth trial Years later I began to recognize the profound transformation those experiences had brought about in me For every failed attempt I made something happened to me Perhaps the most transformative lesson of all was the realization that failure is not a dead end but a stepping stone Every attempt I made served as a stepping stone and gradually propelled me to achieve my dream of making it to university Its okay to stumble and fall what truly matters is our ability to get back up and continue our journey with newfound wisdom and determination Each failed attempt was not the end of a dream but the beginning of a new and improved one During challenging times I learned to lean on the support of others After two attempts I ran to friends and colleagues for proper guidance This helped me to achieve my goals faster Seeking help and advice from mentors friends or family members is not a sign of weakness but a testament to our humility and willingness to learn I discovered the beauty in imperfections I realized that I make mistakes and fail because Im human As Alexander Pope puts it To err is human I only fail because Im not wellequipped with the right knowledge and resources To beat this I roll up my sleeves and work to have these in my possession Through each trial I discovered the incredible power of resilience Before this series of failures I knew how impatient I could be when I made attempts to achieve personal goals especially when there was no external pressure such as that from my parents I simply let go after one or two failed attempts These exams were inevitable My parents eyes were heavily on me and I needed to clear off the shame on my face by joining my friends at the university I was under pressure to get it right After this season of failure I paid attention to how patient Ive become in achieving personal goals I stayed up for any goal until it was achieved and I understood that setbacks are not the end of the road but a detour on the path to success Every failure I experienced served as an opportunity to become more resilient and my resilience grew as I went The ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep moving forward is a skill that can be honed and developed Life is unpredictable and my attempts highlighted the significance of adaptability I realized Im most efficient in the mornings I resolved to study more in the mornings This strategy helped me have a better understanding of concepts and also gave me more time to study each day I applied this routine throughout my days at the university and it helped me perform to my best Being open to change and willing to adjust my approach was crucial to navigating hurdles Flexibility became my secret weapon When things didnt go as planned I discovered that failure can fuel creativity It encouraged me to think outside the box innovate and explore new possibilities I changed strategies and sought new ways of going about my studies and I discovered what worked best for me For example after the fifth attempt I thought of working with past questions from the previous sets This gave me proper guidance during my studies I realized I had never been working smart Its through setbacks that some of the most remarkable innovations have emerged My mother played a significant role throughout the series of failures I experienced She encouraged me giving me confidence in myself Surrounding oneself with a strong support system of friends family and mentors provides invaluable guidance and encouragement during tough times My trials showed me the significance of a dependable network My failures have provided invaluable lessons While its human to fear failure these experiences have taught me to embrace it as a catalyst for growth and learning Each setback every missed mark has propelled me closer to success Through resilience adaptability and an unwavering belief in the process Ive come to understand success often springs from the fertile ground of failure As you embark on your ventures and face inevitable setbacks remember these five lessons learn persevere adapt keep your passion burning and never underestimate the transformative power of failure Thank you for reading If you found this interesting

question Before I start Id say its a good question but also an irrelevant one Everyone has their own life challenges Unique soul wounds that they must learn to heal The philosophy that helped me the most could have no impact on anyone else Thats why this question bothers me Because I could build an entire blogpost that wouldnt serve much purpose So Im going to choose three philosophies instead of one It might broaden your horizons depending on the issues youre dealing with I love Stoicism But not a fan of what Stoicism has become In this day and age statues have taken over internet Entire blogschannels and brands are built around these old writings I like the fact that this philosophy is being brought to light I dont like the fact that shortcuts are being made about it Some people describe a stoic as someone who doesnt feel As if feelings had left his body That hes just a brain without a heart A being made of flesh but without the feelings that make us human This vision of stoicism is reductive and incomplete To enter this stoic universe Marc Aureles Meditations are a magnificent read This is a man who writes his own thoughts Without ever thinking that one day they will be published We have access to pure authentic intimate reflections From a man who has taken the time to meditate on his life his desires his existence Who questions his moral alignment How to be a good man How to live a dignified life How never to betray yourself How to live a good life For the other great Stoics I dont read Seneca He has some quotations critical of wealth while he himself accumulated massive amounts of it I cant read those who are not in line with their word For Epictetus Ill elaborate in a future content Ill need a whole article to explain my position on his thinking Why do men who have renounced all social rules fascinate me Ive no idea If you open my emails or read my content Im sure that many of you hate rules power games between humans the hypocrisy of society the constant lies the mask we have to wear at all times in order to survive The media Politics All these layers of hypocrisy to keep a machine running that doesnt give a damn about us Worse it takes advantage of those who support it The injustice of this world makes you uncomfortable You wonder why this world doesnt run right Why so much suffering We could build a paradise Some do everything to make it a hell Im sure many of you feel that way or you wouldnt read my content I found resistance in Diogenes and Thoreau The refusal of all those idiotic societal rules that we follow because they are only collective beliefs They symbolize courage To say no to madness To run away To refuse to live a life that society wishes to impose on them But more than just refusing To proclaim loud and clear that others are wrong Not just to rebel in their own corners To say what they think To act the way they want Not just to say the words but to live them They will pay the ultimate price mockery and marginalization One by living in a barrel The other by isolating himself from the mundane I have a deep admiration for those who are brave enough to live their words When I discovered an undefeated samurai Who spent his life fighting Living it his way Free It was a revelation I devoured everything I could find on the legendary ronin What I like about Musashi is that his philosophy is made up of simple words Theres nothing to hide behind a myriad of complexities Its only associations of a few words Clear Some quotes from GorinNoSho The Book of Five rings The book is peppered with little phrases full of wisdom He also left Dokkodo The Path of Aloneness It consists of 21 precepts written a week before he died Short sentences with heavy meaning Accept everything just the way it isDo not seek pleasure for its own sakeDo not under any circumstances depend on a partial feeling Do not regret what you have doneThis cryptic phrase took me a long time to understandIt helped me overcome the guilt I couldnt shake off Never be jealousFreeing yourself from envy Never let yourself be saddened by a separationEasy to say harder to do Do not hold on to possessions you no longer needPractical minimalism Dont get caught up in the consumer society You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honorYou can live without a lot of things You cant live without honor Never stray from the Way My favourite Its my phone wallpaper Its on my fridge A reminder never to stray from the path you want to reach If you want to dive into Musashis life Theres a lot of good reads Many anecdotes The famous duel with Sasaki Kojiro His last years His death The transmission of his philosophy Every stage of his life is full of little bits of wisdom you can use This article is coming to an end These were the three philosophies that inspire me most If I had to add honorable mentions This philosophy of the present reminds me of those monks in some lost dojo At mealtime Not a word was to be spoken The meal was taken as a group But talking is forbidden If you have any questions As usual feel free Thank you for reading Have a great Sunday Take care If you love philosophy I have a newsletterI explore philosophical concept to live a better life Join 1344 friends in The World Within,5266,

with low hanging fruit A quick win is an improvement that is visible has immediate benefit and can be delivered quickly after the project begins enfocussolutions If youre looking for a morale boost

performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands Scalability In other words if a system is performing well at a low level it can be just as successful at a higher level The problem is there are a lot of innovative ideas that dont have a clear way of scaling up Since there is not a clear way it can be used on a larger size the idea is put on hold Consider the possibility your business is not going to triple in size immediately If your business doesnt plan on instant growth your idea doesnt always need to scale Buzzwords sneak into everyones vocabulary Continuing into 2017

husband and I spent a late August day several years ago settling in our oldest child Andrew for the start of his first year at college We went to Walmart to buy a mini fridge and rug We hung posters above his bed We attended the obligatory goodbye family lunch before heading to our car to return to a slightly quieter house Two weeks later Andrew called me his voice breaking A student in his dorm had just died as a result of head trauma after a fall the young man took while extremely drunk Media coverage in the months following indicated that instead of seeking help immediately after the fall the young mans friends waited nearly 20 hours to call 911 At that point it was too late for potentially lifesaving medical treatment Im a mom of three and a professor who studies social norms the unwritten rules that shape peoples behavior In my book Why We Act Turning Bystanders into Moral Rebels I explore the factors that keep people from speaking up in the face of problematic behavior of all types Ive thought about the story of my sons classmate often as reports recently surfaced of the widespread hazing among players on the Northwestern University football team four of whom are suing the institution Hazing is remarkably common for instance one NCAA report states 74 of studentathletes experience it Thankfully hazingrelated deaths are more rare I suspect the root cause of these kinds of tragic situations on college campuses is the same misperceiving what other students are thinking and feeling Problematic behavior in group settings from students ignoring signs of a medical emergency to athletes hazing freshman recruits often continues because people privately feel uncomfortable with what they see happening yet believe their peers dont share their concerns This perception regardless of its accuracy leads people to stay silent because they fear the consequences of speaking up Will doing so lead to rejection from the group The most common reason male college students give for failing to speak up in situations involving sexual misconduct is fear of being laughed at or ridiculed This fear is a normal part of human nature But it weighs especially heavily when youre an 18yearold in a new environment and want desperately to fit in Psychologists call this condition pluralistic ignorance A majority of people privately believe one thing but incorrectly assume that most others feel differently Pluralistic ignorance explains why most college students feel theres too much alcohol use on their campus but believe other students are perfectly comfortable with the amount of drinking It explains why most college men privately find sexually aggressive behavior offensive but wrongly believe that others endorse it and why many athletes may privately disagree with hazing but believe that their peers support it Why do people fail to recognize that others might in fact share their own beliefs about hazing or alcohol use or sexual misconduct Its because people tend to believe that the behavior of others reflects their true thoughts and feelings Thus if other people arent speaking up to share their concerns about hazing you might assume they must be perfectly comfortable with such behavior even though youre aware that your own behavior does not always match your beliefs So what can parents coaches and college administrators do to prevent hazing Empirical evidence demonstrates that educating students about the psychological factors that lead people to misperceive what others are actually thinking and feeling can make a real difference My own research has shown that women have lower rates of disordered eating if they learned as freshmen how campus social norms contribute to unhealthy body image ideals Ive found that college students who learn that many of their peers struggle with mental health challenges have a more positive view of mental health services So the first step in preventing hazing is to talk to college students about pluralistic ignorance what it is and how it happens Understanding the psychological processes that lead them to misperceive what those around them are actually thinking is the first step in helping students speak up in the face of bad behavior The next and crucial step is to shift norms about what group loyalty means In tightknit groups such as athletic teams people feel considerable pressure to show loyalty to other group members This sometimes translates into staying silent in the face of bad behavior by their peers sticking together regardless of right or wrong But the same underlying dynamics of peer influence and group cohesion can help create more positive beliefs and behavior How By shifting norms about what it means to protect group members Instead of staying silent about bad behavior the expectation becomes stepping in to keep them safe This approach to changing their behavior teaches students that a single bad act hurts the reputation of the entire group that all members of the group have a responsibility to protect their friends Being a good friend fraternity brother or teammate means speaking up not staying silent This article originally appeared in The

744,https://medium.com/wise-well/the-best-strategy-for-avoiding-regret-take-a-chance-32a9e306f2ea?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,Last month I received a call from my middle child a college senior with quite surprising news Hed just received an offer from the Peace Corps to spend 27 months working in Peru My immediate response as a Mom after offering him my congratulations was to worry Peru is a very long way from our home in Massachusetts and given the limited time off for Peace Corps volunteers he likely wouldnt return home during that entire time But when he asked for my advice I took a deep breath and said I think if you dont go youll regret it My advice was decidedly not based on my preferences as his mother Instead it was based on my knowledge of the psychology of regret We can all think about choices weve made that might have seemed wise at the time but later we come to regret Perhaps it was where you attended college your major or a particular career path Perhaps it was a relationship you stayed in longer than you should have or failed to pursue at all Researchers in one study examined the most common types of regrets for American adults Their findings revealed the following six biggest regrets in order of frequency education I should have studied harder career I should have become a dentist romance I wish Id married Jake instead of Bill parenting I wish Id spent more time with the kids selfimprovement I should have started exercising sooner and leisure I wish Id visited Europe These six categories account for 86 percent of all the regrets listed Research also consistently shows that we experience more regret over things we choose not to do than things we choose to do In other words regrets of inaction haunt us more than regrets of action In one study people were asked what they would do differently if they could live life over again More than half of the regrets had to do with inaction should have attended or completed college should have pursued a particular career should have tried harder in social relationships or marriages In contrast only 12 percent were regrets of action shouldnt have smoked shouldnt have gotten married so early shouldnt have worked so hard These findings explain why we are often haunted by paths not taken our choice to turn down an appealing but less certain job opportunity or fail to express our romantic interest to a friend due to a fear of rejection Why do regrets of inaction linger more than those of action One explanation is that its easier to overcome regrets of action Lets say you took a job you thought was going to be great but come to recognize it was the wrong choice You can quit that job or at least look for another position Or perhaps you chose to spend your limited vacation time taking an expensive cruise only to realize that cruising isnt really your thing You can and should make different plans for your next vacation In other words we can deal with bad choices weve made by learning from our mistakes Its far harder to recover from regrets of inaction If you didnt apply for a job or turned down a job offer at this point theres little you can do to fix that choice That position is almost certainly filled and youll never know if it would have been a better fit If you failed to pursue a longtime crush that person may now be married and youll never know where that relationship would have gone Another explanation is that we process regrets of action versus inaction in different ways Regrets of action often prompt a clear emotional response such as guilt sadness or anger We recognize that mistakes were made and we respond accordingly But its harder to process or come to terms with regrets of inaction This uncertainty helps explain why regrets of action tend to fade over time whereas regrets of inaction may instead increase over time Many people perhaps even most people go through life afraid of taking a chance Why Because taking a chance feels risky It can lead to disappointment failure or rejection And as one of my closest friends always says rejection is never a party Taking a chance does risk failure and disappointment and rejection but theres honor and value in trying no matter the outcome As Teddy Roosevelt famously said The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena who strive valiantly who know the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spend themselves in a worthy cause who at best know the triumph of high achievement and who at worst if they fail fail while daring greatly so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat This type of riskaverse mindset can also have lasting consequences It encourages us to settle for safety instead of venturing boldly into the unknown So we stay with jobs we dont find rewarding and in relationships that dont make us happy The findings from empirical research in psychology are clear if you want to avoid future regret take a chance As author H Jackson Brown Jr wrote Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do So throw off the bowlines Sail away from the safe harbor Catch the trade winds in your sails Explore Dream Discover Thanks for reading Follow me on Instagram for regular tips on happiness and

745,https://medium.com/wise-well/change-your-stress-mindset-change-your-life-2dcbaa34fb98?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,A couple of weeks ago I was driving to give a talk when a massive traffic jam suddenly appeared I sat on I95 in an absolute standstill watching the minutes tick by and getting increasingly nervous that I wouldnt arrive on time Eventually traffic started slowly moving again albeit in a single lane I then passed what had clearly been a terrible accident three firetrucks blocked most of the highway surrounding three or four badly damaged cars And of course my concern about being late seemed very unimportant This example illustrates the powerful role of mindset or thought patterns in influencing our experience of stress My initial thought was that being late for my talk was a terrible outcome But this thought shifted as I recognized that experiencing a major car accident was far worse Many people think about stress as a negative and something to be avoided because it leads to poor outcomes low test scores in children career burnout in executives and choking in athletes This mindset increases anxiety disrupts performance and becomes a selffulfilling prophecy However people who see stress as a normal part of daily life and with a positive mindset experience stress as exhilarating and invigorating and they reap the benefits of this extra energy to respond effectively to various challenges As you might predict people with this type of mindset often end up with better overall outcomes These are the folks who do their best work under pressure and when stakes are high This type of mindset is how elite athletes approach highstakes competitions such as a mustwin playoff game or the Olympics The way we think about stress also has a major impact on physical health People who think about stress as detrimental and debilitating show higher levels of cortisol a stress hormone in response to challenging situations Over time this physiological response can lead to bad health outcomes including higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease But it isnt just the experience of stress that affects health the very perception that stress affects health also has an impact Researchers in one study asked nearly twentynine thousand people to rate their overall level of stress over the last year and how much they believed that stress affected their health a little a moderate amount or a lot People who reported having experienced a lot of stress and who also believed that stress had a large impact on their health were 43 percent more likely to die over the next eight years In contrast people who experienced a lot of stress but did not feel stress had a major impact on health were no more likely to die than those who had experienced little or moderate levels of stress This finding tell us that it isnt necessarily the experience of high levels of stress that increases the risk of mortality Instead whats particularly detrimental is having a high level of stress coupled with the belief that stress leads to negative health outcomes In fact people who believe that stress affects health a lot or extremely are more than twice as likely to die from a heart attack compared to those without such beliefs But heres the good news Regardless of your natural tendency you can shift your stress mindset Understanding the role of mindset in influencing how you think about stress is the first step in learning how to reframe it in a new more positive way People who learn strategies for reframing stress in a more adaptive way as energizing and inspiring not just exhausting and debilitating show better psychological and physical wellbeing For example college students who learn about the benefits of stress including how stress increases arousal and thereby leads to improved academic performance show lower levels of math anxiety and better test scores This type of reframing reduces cardiovascular stress and its overall wear and tear on the body Heres a simple example about the practical benefits of changing our stress mindset Researchers in one study assigned employees at a large financial institution to watch one of two videos The first group watched a stressisdebilitating video which described various harmful aspects of stress including its role in poor performance at work and negative health outcomes The second group watched a stressisenhancing video which described the benefits of stress for improving creativity productivity and the immune system As the researchers predicted people who watched the stressisenhancing video showed substantial benefits They reported better work performance as well as lower levels of anxiety and depression We cant control what life throws at us but we can all practice reframing difficult events as challenges instead of threats And this simple shift in mindset has substantial benefits for our psychological and physical health

can help just one mom struggling with her feeding decision Breastfeeding mothers of the world prepare yourselves for what I am about to share I chose not to breastfeed WHAT Dont worry I can hear your collective gasp and all I can think in my head is why judge Why are we judging a mothers choice on how she feeds her child Before you decide I am unworthy of being on the planet or even calling myself a mother STOP Let me share with you why I made that choice for my children and myself As long as I could remember I wanted to be a mother Turns out I had to really really want to be a mother as I miscarried seven times before my first child was born I was pregnant thirteen times to eventually having the sheer joy of mothering four When my firstborn arrived I had just completed a marathon 40week throwup session I was sick all day every day for nine months It turns out that growing a baby is not something my body enjoys and I have an adverse reaction By the time she was born I was clinically malnourished She literally took every good bit of me for herself and I was more than happy to give it to her After 7 miscarriages it was the very least I could do for a healthy outcome So it was not because I am selfish or not mothering enough My body needed to heal The perfect formula was available and so it was what I nourished my child with I had a trick that I used exclusively with my first born Only I fed her for her first three months Just mom and baby settled in and away she went We made eye contact she felt the warmth and smell of mom and she knew my voice and that I her mother would be the sole nurturer for those first twelve weeks of life It was beautiful and I would not change that decision for anything She was healthy and I recovered from my pregnancy Turns out I needed that recovery period because a mere 1216 weeks later our second daughter was on her way I was pretty sick again but managed because I had to I had an infant to care for When I was 7 plus months pregnant with Alexandra I was in a horrible car vs Mack truck car accident on the freeway The truck driver was at fault I was the only one injured out of the 3 other adults and one baby in the car and one in the womb My left shoulder broke the driver side window That is how hard I hit Alexandra safely arrived two months later and I was immediately treated with powerful narcotics and antiinflammatory drugs to ease the pain of what was a torn rotator cuff The doctors were not 100 percent sure of the what effect if any the drugs would have on my milk but I was not taking any chances I chose not to breastfeed Not only did my body need to heal from the constant throwing up but needed to recover from a horrible accident The Same protocol followed in that I was the sole provider of feedings for my newborn daughter Two years later another daughter arrived Sadly she also died six hours later Stephanie was born with Trisomy 18 which is an extra chromosome and although chances of survival have improved today babies like Stephanie rarely survive I really thought my baby days were over but four years later Sabrina arrived and one year and one week later our last baby Steven My pattern of extreme sickness ensued and some other health factors were added to the equation Once again I enjoyed that exclusive mama feeding which I believe is the greatest gift of motherhood That one on one uninterrupted time with the brand new baby Sabrina is just completing her freshman year of college and Steven is graduating from high school in a few short weeks They are also happy and healthy with brilliant futures ahead of them Choosing breastfeeding or choosing formula is highly personal and should not be judged either way The newest trend of pumping and bottle feeding baffles me But again it is highly personal I am sure these women have their reasons and really believe it is best for their babies I would argue otherwise This is where parenting wars escalate Who is right Who could say Does formula feeding cause autism Or is it environmental and therefore passed through breast milk Google that question and you will find hundreds of thousands of thoughts In one essay the author seeks to blame formula And yet every comment refers to a child that was breastfed and is still autistic There is no answer Be gentle with your fellow moms and their choices Everyone has a story and their reasons might surprise you No parent is a failure who nourishes and cares for their child We are all in this together What is most important is the overall well being of your individual family unit I will support your decision either way,4662, Breastfeeding mothers of the world prepare yourselves for what I am about to share I chose not to breastfeed WHAT Dont worry I can hear your collective gasp and all I can think in my head is why judge Why are we judging a mothers choice on how she feeds her child? I made that choice for my children and myself as long as I could remember I wanted to be a mother .

Rejection The Day Harvard Rejected My Daughter Today more than ever before parents are vying for the top spots offered in all of the best colleges Just because the school is ranked best overall is it best for your child WAIT Hold the presses Did I just say parents are vying for the top spots Yes I did indeed Parents are dreaming dreams for their kids that the kid may just not qualify for or even want Middle of February through March is the time across America that high school seniors receive definitive admission answers from colleges and universities All through March and April 1 the cell phone buzzes the email arrives and the snail mailbox is stuffed full The Yippee the Wahoos and the painful tears from rejections For some they are a tad more relaxed because they have already been accepted to the school of their dreams and this part is merely ceremonial At least you would think And then it happens Your perfect child who did everything right hears via email text message and snail mail that they are just not the right fit for such and such school Most schools are kind and the guy that signs his name on the bottom of the letter understands the power he wields when he rejects your perfect specimen of a child So he or she is gentle Your work your resume and your involvement have not gone unnoticed by our admissions committee We have had our largest application pool ever in the history of our school and I am so sorry we will not be offering you a place at this time We have no doubt you will be a tremendous success in life and many schools will be lucky to have you As you read the letter and see the tears stream down your childs face you understand both sides Secretly you are relieved because really how were you going to pay for that school Harvard is a classy place and they know it They let you down gently At least you applied And then the next envelope is opened and again the rejection letter is read This time you want to call personally the very meanspirited admissions director for their choice of words Whereas your 42 GPA is impressive unfortunately you are just not up to the caliber of the students we admit to our school We wish you luck in your educational endeavors This last one seems extreme but it truly was the words on of my second daughters rejection letters And believe it or not it was not IVY nor a toptier That was one of those letters that when you read it you could feel the sting of the imaginary slap across your face Lucky for her she had already been given a very lucrative financial package at the school of her second choice Although her first choice had gently let her down and offered her ways of transfer this last letter was from a school barely on her radar So that brings us to the question that looms Did she give less of herself in the application process to this school They could tell it was not her best and so they let her have it in the rejection letter Who can know When it comes to the rejection it is important to be present for your child Let them speak when they want to Dont expect them to come right out with feelings or thoughts They may not even know how they feel at the moment What is important is to encourage and support and let them know that many great colleges exist in the world and just because the school comes with a big name does not mean it is the best fit The hard part of the whole process is if your kid attends a college prep high school where admittance to top tier colleges is king It is on the school campus itself that the pressure is toughest There are shouts of I got into UCLA I got into Princeton I got into USC I got into Johns Hopkins And with each new shout of a bigger and better acceptance come the oohs and aahs of adoration Some real some from defeat and sheer envy even from adults who remember too well in their life this first week of March For parents that wield their childrens successes in everyones face it is in poor taste to write on your car windows My kid just got into Stanfordand yours didnt Fast forward to June when the high school diploma is handed out Everyone dissipates with promises of never forgetting one another and being BFFs until the end of time And a week or so later reality sets in and all of the accolades of a perfect high school career go into a memory box and we set out to start new again In my house neither daughter got the first choice in their quest for college admittance But what did we know Our physics major got into a top ten school for that major and our film major got into the number two for her major They both turned out to be perfect fits for their undergraduate years Neither university sports huge moneymaking sports teams or Greek societies on the front page of scandal making news Parties abound but it is not their thing It seemed such a let down on March 1st and 2nd but it turned out to be a tremendous gift Like perfectly tailored clothes both girls headed into their respective dorms with confidence that they would succeed And so far so good We went through this grueling process two years in a row We survived and I know you will as well,5147, Parents are dreaming dreams for their kids that the kid may just not qualify for or even want . The day Harvard Rejected My Daughter was the words on the words of her second daughters rejection letters .

undergoing a seismic shift that according to the McKinsey Global Institute is happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale or roughly 3000 times the impact compared to the Industrial Revolution The reality is that professionals grapple with a volatile economy where the shelflife of skills is shrinking hybrid jobs are increasing and fears about automations disruptive impact on the job market make headlines every week In the US despite surging stocks and historic GDP growth peoples incomes and wages havent kept up and income inequality continues to accelerate Around the globe governments and employers alike recognize that areas such as AI and automation are quickly reshaping the workplace And the gap between the skills workers have and the skills companies need is growing wider as workers struggle to keep pace with emerging technologies in fastgrowing industries In my role at General Assembly I get the opportunity to speak with US policymakers and analysts who grapple with employment and workforce development issues and formulate solutions to ensure Americans can succeed in the new world of work In these conversations examples of education and workforce investment models spearheaded in other cities and countries often come up and how we might repurpose them Global training providers like GA are also partnering with organizations to craft upskilling and reskilling programs that arm professionals with cuttingedge skills and also generate creative sources for talent in an increasingly competitive market We know technology is transforming the global workforce Whats less clear is how this transformation will take place and what policymakers learning and development providers and business leaders should be doing to prepare for it In our new white paper which we developed in collaboration with Whiteboard Advisors and features a foreword from former Acting US Secretary of Labor Seth Harris we uncover a lot of useful insights about how the US and other industrialized nations are navigating these employment and workforce issues Our study examines the experiences and policy initiatives of six countries Australia Denmark France Germany Singapore and Switzerland and their strategies to improve upskilling economic mobility and employability in an evolving and at times turbulent marketplace While the US economy and labor market have unique characteristics we discovered there are lessons to be learned from other developed economies pursuing workforce development programs and initiatives For example we examine Australias Vocational Education and Training VET program which provides government support toward helping people pursue noncollege skills training Or consider Germanys Dual Training System where companies partner with publiclyfunded vocational schools to provide job training As American politicians educators and business leaders we must ask ourselves How can the startling impact of these innovative approaches be applied within a US context Its a question industry stakeholders and experts have posed to General Assembly with increased frequency since we were acquired by The Adecco Group in April 2018 As the largest human capital solutions company in the world The Adecco Group is an active participant in the highly successful Swiss apprenticeship model a governmentled initiative that provides young Swiss professionals paid apprenticeships designed in partnership with Swiss companies and thats recognized around the world as a paradigm for workbased learning Putting the Future of Work in a Global Context offers a highlevel analysis of these and other examples of skill and employabilitybuilding initiatives in industrialized nations as well as a few observations Todays increasingly global workplace demands a more nuanced comprehensive understanding of the different ways governments and industries are addressing and responding to economic mega trends Our hope is that this paper can begin a conversation about the lessons ideas and insights that other countries have to share with US policymakers employers and practitioners on how to respond to and anticipate the future of work

But there is another side that is just as important gaining the domain knowledge and forming a longterm vision for your team product and company .

Ive lost many nights of sleep to questions like What if we cant deliver the project on time or How can I know if everything will be fine?
833,https://medium.com/free-code-camp/when-to-refactor-legacy-code-vs-when-to-stay-focused-on-your-current-project-fda99919cc34?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,When I work on projects I often run into legacy code that can be improved to be more readable more testable or more compliant with the current coding style My urge to refactor the code is especially strong after spending a good amount of time trying to understand a piece of obscure code That code hurts my brain and I dont want the same thing to happen to other developers There is the adaptation of the famous Boy Scout Rule Leave Code Better than You Found It But at the same time I also want to stay focused and make progress on my current projects I worry that I might get distracted and spend too much time refactoring This is a dilemma I often face I want to be the good samaritan leaving code better than I found it an engineer turning all the messy code I come across into something clean and elegant But I also want to stay pragmatic and ship projects quickly Balancing between refactoring the legacy code I come across and staying focused on my current project can be hard A recent conversation with my manager on this topic provided me guidance to find that balance Here are a few points I find helpful After I read a piece of legacy code my brain immediately thinks about how it should be ideally But refactoring that code from its current state to the ideal state sometimes requires an extensive refactoring At its best the required refactoring can be timeconsuming At its worst it can turn into a rabbit hole that causes a big delay on the project When I face cases like this I used to either take a chance and do the extensive refactoring anyway or hold my nose and let the code stay stinky Now I realize there is a happy middle point I dont have the make the code perfect I can spend as much or as little time as I can afford to make the code a bit better Small improvements I do can be still useful for the developers that come next And those developers may have time to improve the code further building upon the improvements I make PS Theres no perfect nor ideal code The moment you make a change you see more improvements you can make Timeboxing is a great technique to avoid rabbit holes Before starting to refactor do a quick estimation about how much time you can spend on refactoring legacy code without delaying the project too much Write that number down Timeboxing your refactoring gives you the peace of mind knowing the main project will stay on track And that makes the refactoring experience more enjoyable Things can be even easier if you bake the refactoring time into the project estimation before starting a project While estimating how much time a project might take take a quick look at the code you need to touch when was it first written How readable and extensible is it How much test coverage does it have Unless theres a hard requirement about when the project needs to be shipped you should bake some refactoring time into the projects timeline After all as we keep building upon a legacy codebase refactoring it as we go is the best way to keep it healthy And a healthy codebase in turn makes building new features faster and safer Refactoring a piece of code is the best way to understand it Compared to staying aloof and just reading a piece of code coming in and modifying it gives you a much deeper and intimate relationship with the code When you try to add your touch to the code you will start to notice things you missed before You may see the constraints and may even understand why the author originally wrote the code this way Although refactoring a piece of code doesnt seem to add any immediate value to the business its an opportunity for you to gain a piece of domain knowledge you currently dont have Gaining that domain knowledge is invaluable to both you and the business The more you do it the faster you become One last reason to refactor legacy code is to use it as an opportunity to strengthen your refactoring muscle Investing in building your refactoring muscle has a selfreinforcing compound effect the more you refactor the better you are at refactoring making your next refactoring faster The more you do it the better the codebase is making building future features faster Luckily my next project relates to code from almost three years ago I expect to face many cases requiring me to balance between refactoring legacy code and making progress on the project I will share my new learning on my personal blog NOT

But what if each request actually knew how to execute itself then the method can be as simple as Instead of letting the act_on_requests method decide how each request should be handled we distribute that responsibility and knowledge back to each request and let it decide how to itself . The code above should work fine except for one

There are four steps involved in the Template Method design pattern . In Ruby we have a parent class DietOrder and have DietOrderSihui and DietOrderAmber inherit from it . The Hollywood Principle is a real thing .

we are thrilled to announce the testnet launch of Swan Chain on Optimisms OP Stack This marks the start of our journey towards building an open marketplace for cloud resources driving growth in the Superchain ecosystem On September 26th Swan Network concluded its grand Lagrange Mars Testnet campaign with major achievements In sum 28 Computing Providers worldwide offered diverse computing resources In total over 130 GPUs were deployed from 9 countries and 17 cities supplying over 100000 hours of GPU service and 150000 hours of CPU service to the network of builders Over 100000 stunning images were created using the Stable Diffusion space on Lagrange and 40000 images have been uploaded into MultiChain Storage and backed up on IPFS and Filecoin storage Swan Network formerly FilSwan built as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution is designed to enhance decentralized computing networks It integrates a tool suite that streamers developers access to resources across multiple blockchains We launched the Swan Testnet with the vision of an open marketplace for cloud resources To bring this vision to life weve chosen to build Swan Testnet on Optimisms OP Stack making Swan Chain the newest addition to the Superchain ecosystem With the evergrowing Artificial Intelligence need for computing resources and Web3 DApps deployment GPUs are the new oil in this ecosystem that powers the growth of innovation With the scale of geographically distributed computing power that Swan Network can provide Currently covering 9 countries and 17 cities Swan aims to continue expanding its ability to support the needs of the growing ecosystem Multichain Payment Channel Swan Testnet introduces a multichain payment channel built with Chainlink functions that enable users to pay with stablecoins like USDC on various networks including Ethereum Polygon Optimism and Arbitrum Your payments will be seamlessly converted into SWAN tokens on Optimism providing a new income source for Computing Providers SWAN the native utility token of Swan Network has a lot of features and benefits however any token that has intrinsic volatility poses a problem for longterm providers and users The incorporation of alternate settlement currencies is one way to address the issue of longterm volatility The stablecoin USDC which is based on the US dollar will be used for the implementation of stable payments Future additions of settlement currencies can be made with a straightforward governance proposal AIWeb3 Computing Support Swan Testnet is committed to democratizing AI resources We provide computing support to the Optimism ecosystem empowering machine learning models and Web3 applications Users can also access the Lagrange platform and generate DataNFT which is backed up to IPFS and Filecoin storage via MultiChain Storage and verified by Chainlink Functions With the booming of AI and Web3 a shortage of computing power is becoming a nonignorable problem Traditionally major providers like Google Cloud and AWS not only charge a large sum for the GPUs but are also hard to access for many startups This acts as a barrier of entry for many AI and Web3 projects and consequentially blocks innovation Universal Basic Income UBI Trial SWANs UBI system ensures fair compensation for network providers even during periods of inactivity As a part of the Swan Testnet the UBI Trial program allows every eligible Computing Provider to participate and win UBI rewards This pioneering initiative aims to provide stability and support to providers and provide a basic level of compensation to qualified providers Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program To meet the growing demand for geographically distributed computing resources across the Swan ecosystem were launching the Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program during the Swan Testnet Computing Providers from areas without a representative CP can earn additional rewards of 600 SWAN fostering diversity and participation in underrepresented regions Referral Rewards All Computing Providers whether existing or new CPs can earn referral rewards by referring qualified CPs For each qualified referral you will receive 300 SWAN tokens as a referral reward encouraging a thriving community To further our mission and encourage more Computing Providers to join us in building an open cloud resource market we are excited to launch the Jupiter

926,https://medium.com/devteamspace/what-we-learned-from-1-000-development-projects-26dc0338aaa7?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,For most businesses having an inhouse development team is simply not an option You already have dozens of responsibilities on your plate Having an extra five to ten developers in your company means more salaries more time lost in management and more stress This is exactly why businesses of all sizes and in all industries decide to outsource their apps design and development to readymade teams with experience This process of delegation lowers costs shortens the time from concept to launch and allows you to continue focusing on core business activities Both remote software development teams and the mass of businesses that employ them have exponentially increased in number The vast majority of software today is developed via outsourcing and we believe the ratio will continue to grow in their favor Of course this movement brings with it many challenges The two main ones are Today we would like to offer you an overview of what you can do as an app owner to assure that your apps development process is as smooth as can be Eliminate as Much Doubt as Possible From the very beginning be very clear and very blunt The rule here is to avoid presumptions Dont presume the devs know what you want or how you want it Here are a few points of advice to help you eliminate doubt Ways to Keep in Touch Professionals are not robots Theyre regular people just like you and me As a result It is best to avoid having long backandforth emails conversations no one likes them Use email only to discuss less important or less timesensitive issues Instead use other more effective means of communication You can use sharable documents todo lists instant messaging chat rooms video conferences phone calls and a variety of other tools Let me give you a few examples of what each of these mediums can be used for Important note Effective communication is always twoways You cannot expect your team to know what youre thinking so be proactive about offering constructive feedback and asking questions as often as you can Have a Separate AccountProject Manager PM It is critical to have someone in charge of managing the development process and keeping all stakeholders in the loop Many times both these roles can be handled by one person Someone which has a technical background and is also skilled in effective communication The PM has to understand technical terms and be able to translate them into plain English And this goes both ways All of your requirements and feedback have to be broken apart into small modules and tasks for the devs to work on A PM knows and uses all of the points outlined within this article An effective PM is invisible during most of the development process You talk and give feedback directly to the devs which are the ones responsible for providing you with daily reports Project managers hop in only to when needed to clarify or solve certain situations Use Version Control Systems Make sure the dev team uses systems such as Github or Bitbucket and request an invitation to the projects branch This will allow you to see all of the changes that are being made to your apps source code This point is extremely useful for techsavvy cofounders who understand everything thats going on On the other hand if you are not familiar with the code the PM has your back In either case we recommend that you insist on the use of versioning systems even if there will be just one person working on the code for your app Regular Pulse Checks Most software development projects take several months to complete Dont expect everything to go as planned and dont wait until the last month to check on progress Together with your project manager decide on a system of communication We recommend daily written reports and weekly calls Remember Its not that you dont trust your team You just dont want to take any chances At the end of the day this is better for both sides Trust Your Gut Feeling If you have doubts or simply dont understand certain aspects of the development process ask No one expects you to understand everything Youre hiring a team of experts for a reason If you pay them well it is their duty to both deliver a finished product and keep you informed throughout the entire process One of the biggest mistakes you can make is ignoring the small silent voices that pop up in your mind State your observations as soon as they arise This will help you avoid any unpleasant surprises down the road Avoid MicroManagement Set up a clear system of communication and then trust the process If youve picked your dev team well enough then they know what theyre doing There is no need for you or anyone else to disturb them As discussed in previous points there are tens of tools and systems that help you keep track on a daily basis of everything thats being done on your project Avoid interrupting your team for the sake of conversation Let them do the work and engage with them only at scheduled meetings Taking into consideration all of the above points will almost guarantee your app will be ready on time within the specified budget and with the least bit of obstacles If youre thinking of having something built or improved tell us about it We have over 700 experienced

935,https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/why-algorithms-matter-45e6742decea?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,In the previous chapter we took a look at our first data structures and saw how choosing the right data structure can affect the performance of our code Even two data structures that seem so similar such as the array and the set can have very different levels of efficiency In this chapter were going to discover that even if we decide on a particular data structure another major factor can affect the efficiency of our code the proper selection of which algorithm to use Although the word algorithm sounds like something complex it really isnt An algorithm is simply a set of instructions for completing a specific task Even a process as simple as preparing a bowl of cereal is technically an algorithm as it involves following a defined set of steps to achieve the task at hand The cerealpreparation algorithm follows these four steps for me at least 1 Grab a bowl 2 Pour cereal into the bowl 3 Pour milk into the bowl 4 Dip a spoon into the bowl When applied to computing an algorithm refers to the set of instructions given to a computer to achieve a particular task When we write any code then were creating algorithms for the computer to follow and execute We can also express algorithms using plain English to set out the details of the instructions we plan on providing the computer Throughout this book Ill use both plain English as well as code to show how various algorithms work Sometimes its possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the same task We saw an example of this at the beginning of Chapter 1 Why Data Structures Matter where we had two different approaches for printing out even numbers In that case one algorithm had twice as many steps as the other In this chapter well encounter another two algorithms that solve the same problem In this case though one algorithm will be faster than the other by orders of magnitude To explore these new algorithms well need to take a look at a new data structure The ordered array is almost identical to the classic array we saw in the previous chapter The only difference is that ordered arrays require that the values are always kept you guessed it in order That is every time a value is added it gets placed in the proper cell so that the values in the array remain sorted For example lets take the array 3 17 80 202 Assume we want to insert the value 75 into the array If this array were a classic array we could insert the 75 at the end as follows As we saw in the previous chapter the computer can accomplish this in a single step On the other hand if this were an ordered array wed have no choice but to insert the 75 in the proper spot so that the values remain in ascending order Now this is easier said than done The computer cannot simply drop the 75 into the right slot in a single step because it first has to find the right place to insert the 75 and then shift the other values to make room for it Lets break down this process step by step Lets start again with our original ordered array Step 1 We check the value at index 0 to determine whether the value we want to insert the 75 should go to its left or to its right Because 75 is greater than 3 we know that the 75 will be inserted somewhere to its right However we dont know yet exactly which cell it should be inserted into so we need to check the next cell Well call this type of step a comparison where we compare the value were inserting to a number already present in the ordered array Step 2 We inspect the value at the next cell 75 is greater than 17 so we need to move on Step 3 We check the value at the next cell Weve encountered the value 80 which is greater than the 75 we wish to insert Since weve reached the first value that is greater than 75 we can conclude that the 75 must be placed immediately to the left of this 80 to maintain the order of this ordered array To do this we need to shift data to make room for the 75 Step 4 Move the final value to the right Step 5 Move the nexttolast value to the right Step 6 We can finally insert the 75 into its correct spot It emerges that when inserting into an ordered array we need to always conduct a search before the actual insertion to determine the correct spot for the insertion This is one difference in performance between a classic array and an ordered array We can see in this example that there were initially four elements and that insertion took six steps In terms of N wed say that for N elements in an ordered array the insertion took N 2 steps in total Interestingly the number of steps for insertion remains similar no matter where in the ordered array our new value ends up If our value ends up toward the beginning of the ordered array we have fewer comparisons and more shifts If our value ends up toward the end we get more comparisons but fewer shifts The fewest steps occur when the new value winds up at the very end since no shifts are necessary In this case we take N steps to compare the new value with all N existing values plus one step for the insertion itself yielding a total of N 1 steps While insertion is less efficient for an ordered array than for a classic array the ordered array has a secret superpower when it comes to searching,5181, An algorithm

Even a process as simple as preparing a bowl of cereal is technically an algorithm as it involves following a defined set of steps to achieve the task at hand .

through LinkedIn I came across a comment that made me realize the need to write a simple yet insightful article to shed light on this matter This article aims to compare different opensource libraries for LLM inference and serving We will explore their killer features and shortcomings with realworld deployment examples We will look at frameworks such as vLLM Text generation inference OpenLLM Ray Serve and others Despite the abundance of frameworks for LLMs inference each serves its specific purpose Here are some key points to consider If this has caught your attention I invite you to delve deeper and explore them in more detail For the hardware setup I used a single A100 GPU with a memory capacity of 40 GB I used LLaMA1 13b as the model since it is supported by all the libraries in the list The article will not cover traditional libraries for serving deep learning models like TorchServe KServe or Triton Inference Server Although you can infer LLMs with these libraries I have focused only on frameworks explicitly designed to work with LLMs Fast and easytouse library for LLM inference and serving It achieves 14x 24x higher throughput than HuggingFace Transformers HF and 22x 25x higher throughput than HuggingFace Text Generation Inference TGI Offline Batched Inference API Server While the library offers userfriendly features and a wide range of functionalities I have come across a few limitations This is the fastest library for LLM inference Thanks to its internal optimizations it significantly outperforms its competitors Nevertheless it does have a weakness in supporting a limited range of models You can find vLLM Development Roadmap here A Rust Python and gRPC server for text generation inference Used in production at HuggingFace to power LLMs APIinference widgets Run web server using docker Make queries I believe this is one of the leading contenders in the race The library is wellwritten and I faced minimal challenges during model deployment If you desire native integration with HuggingFace this is definitely worth considering Note that the project team recently changed the license You can find TGI Development Roadmap here CTranslate2 is a C and Python library for efficient inference with Transformer models First convert the models Make queries I find the library intriguing The developers are actively working on it evident from the releases and commit on GitHub and they also share informative blog posts about its application The librarys numerous optimizations are impressive and its primary highlight is the ability to perform LLM inference on the CPU MII makes lowlatency and highthroughput inference possible powered by DeepSpeed Run web server Make queries The project is based on the reliable DeepSpeed library which has earned its reputation in the community If you seek stability and a triedandtested solution MII would be an excellent option Based on my experiments the library exhibits the best speed for handling a single prompt Nonetheless I advise testing the framework on your specific tasks before implementing it into your system An open platform for operating large language models LLMs in production Run web server Make queries This is a good framework with a wide range of features It enables you to create a flexible application with minimal expenses While some aspects might not be fully covered in the documentation you will likely discover pleasant surprises in its additional capabilities as you delve into this library Ray Serve is a scalable modelserving library for building online inference APIs

To remember the words on the list they either read them various times andor write them over and over to remember them long term . The answer is simple enough make the words more memorable This can be done by Using pictures to support the translation see the photo below for an example .

content summary for this week June 25 2018 Teaching Yourself a Language Heres Some Advice June 26 2018 What to Study First When Learning a Language June 27 2018 The Only 3 Things You Should Care About June 30 2018 Intensive Studies Momentum Perspective and More Its been a while since someone has asked me to do their homework for them but the answer is still unequivocally no I will NOT do anyones homework for them As many of you know Ive been working on being healthier more active since mid 2016 A small hack that has been allowing me to eat more veggies is leaving a bowl of veggies on the table Because they are easily accessible I eat them I know it has nothing to do with languages but I thought I would share regardless Hair isnt done and I need to shave BUT the message is still true Learning a language is all about taking small steps every day to progress in your languageThe irony of this post is that its the opposite of what Ive been doing recently I study Mandarin about 12 times per week which is not enough However I am doing regular Gujarati practice and am noticing my progress especially with reading listening comprehensionI have a small challenge for both you the reader and myself lets spend at least 510 minutes on a language that weve been neglecting For me that will be Mandarin If youve been diligent with your studies lets up the ante Do 510 minutes of something CHALLENGING in your target language A few options post a video of you talking on Instagram watch a video on YouTube that is harder to understand than usual set up a language exchange with someone on italkicomanything Do something that makes you think to yourself wow that would be toughGood luck If you want post what you are going to do and your results in the comments below FAQ How many hours should I study per week Answer It depends Here is a scale you can use to determine the right answer for you Under 2hrsweek not enough25hrsweek bare minimum69hrsweek good1014hrsweek great1519hrsweek serious language learner20hrsweek intensive studies Most of you should likely be aiming for the bare minimum or good category That is a manageable amount for anyone with a full time job or who is a full time student If you need to learn a language quickly for whatever reason you can start looking at the great or above categories For people with lots of time on their hands ie between jobs on summer break etc its worth considering the intensive studies to make noticeable progress rapidly Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want help structuring your study schedule Time for a ThrowbackThursday Its fun to look back at older content to see what I said and if my thoughts on the topic have changed For this one I still agree with what I said If you want to achieve a low intermediate aka a B1 level in 2 years or less you should be studying 10 hrs per week You also need to pick your study topics strategically based on what vocabulary will be frequently required One thing Ill add is the following if you were to study LESS than 10 hours per week on average it is still possible to achieve a B1 level For example if you took an intensive course for 2 months where you practiced for 20 hours per week achieving a B1 level seems doable Additionally I think the target language plays a factor because everyone will likely find some languages to be easier than others Now that I think about it some people are just faster at learning languages in general which is yet another factor I didnt originally mention All of that said if you aim for an average of 10 hours of strategic studying per week you have excellent odds of achieving at least a B1 in 2 years even if you are a slower learner than the Average Joe Such a common question so I thought Id share this snippet of a conversation I had with a follower Making a study plan is as simple as finding free time on a daily basis using it to studypractice In terms of WHAT to practicestudy it will depend on your overall goals level However three things that can give you some direction are taking classes following a selfstudy program andor following a textbook Note as I am writing this Weekly Review post to see the full conversation between me and the follower please visit the Instagram post below It is a series of pictures Just shared this on my Instagram story but heres the full version of what happened I was just out for a run and suddenly I kept seeing the 2 bird shadows on the ground circling me I looked up and there were two crows swooping at me Apparently I was running close to a nest I SPRINTED in the other direction but the crows wouldnt stop chasing me I think they wanted to be 100 sure that I wouldnt come back to the area mission accomplishedSo long story shortmy run was more effective a better workout than I expected P Thanks for readingwatching To learn more about me visit httpsazrenthelanguagenerdcom,4934, A small hack that has been allowing me to eat more veggies is

966,https://medium.com/@polyglotazren/week-in-review-june-18-24-2018-21501edfb531?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,Hi everyone Hope you had a great week Mine was excellent Here is the content summary for this week I ran a free accent reduction workshop last week This is a short clip where I talk about the first step to learning a difficult sound or letter in a foreign language It is so hard to improve your pronunciation or accent without doing this first step so I highly recommend spending time on it Full video is here httpsyoutubebWBkRSPJFIA Answer Put in the time Learning a language is just like any other skill If you dont practice regularly you wont get better Answer Ultimately you only have so much time in a day If you want learn a new language you need to make it a priority and create space in your schedule A few ways to do that are Be more efficient andor organized with your time to open up space to study Wake up 1530 minutes earlier every day and use that time to study Reduce the time you spend on something else and put it towards your language studies ie less social media Netflix etc Listen to language learning audios ie Glossika while you commute to workschool Hope this helped Have a great rest of the day Feeling unmotivated to study a language often has to do with your environment Who are you hanging out with What content are you watching online How many hours do you spend at work or doing other activities unrelated to language learning These are all factors to consider If nothing in your physical or digital life has to do with languages you will not spend much time on that aspect of your life Its a simple question of out of sight out of mind Thats why I recommend you are mindful of your environment A practical strategy that works is to follow accounts online that produce content that teaches your target language Alternatively if your level is high enough you can follow shows or personalities online who speak the language youre studying That way you will see content on a daily basis in your target language An effective real world tactic you can try is labelling the things in your house For example if you were learning Spanish stick a paper on your window that says la ventana Do that with various objects in your home This willl create a physical environment that reminds you to continue moving forward and progressing Theres SO many ways one can approach learning a language A best method does not exist As long as you are practicing regularly and adjusting your approach accordingly based on your results youll be sccessful However this often brings up the following question if there isnt a best method how do I know which pathway to follow The answer is simple follow the one that appeals to you most Do your research by searching through YouTube Google Instagram and other onlineoffline sources I promise you there will be a teacher application audio program or some other resource that appeals to you Use that resource and go allin on it until its not bringing you value anymore When that happens adjust your course of action Full video here httpsyoutube2RG_6sGak3k These are screenshots of a conversation I had with someone in the comments of a Facebook post As you can see the individual originally felt like they didnt have enough time to put towards language learning They were even thinking about finding a new job to open up more space However after digging a little deeper this person realized that they spend about 2 hours a day on watching videossocial media In other words they actually DO have time to acquire a language I think the lesson to be learned here is that we generally have more time than we think Its simply a matter of analyzing where our time is going on a daily basis and making the necessary adjustments Lets have some fun embarrass myself at the same time I am a weird person Here are some odd language facts about me 1 I often mix up lions and tigers Unless I stop to think I consider them as the same animal 2 I often mix up ginger and garlic I can rarely remember which one is which 3 For years I said mug cup instead of saying mug 4 I only recently discovered that you cant say I am lawnmowing and that you should say I am mowing the lawn I also often say snow shoveling instead of shoveling the snow 5 I have weird names for some movies books For example I call The Jungle Book Mogli or is it Mowgli and the Ferocious Beast I also recently started saying Dinosaurs instead of Jurassic Park 6 I speak to my mom with a slight Indian accenteven though she doesnt have an Indian accent I also sometimes take a slight Indian accent if I speak to someone who has one 7 I think razors should be called shavers 8 Instead of nose hair trimmer I say nose cutter 9 I dont know why but I sometimes use the word washing machine instead of dishwasher 10 Until last year I thought that the expression was two peas in a POT and not two peas in a POD 11 Until grade 11 I thought LMAO stood for laughing my arm off 12 I feel like flip flops should be called FlippyFloppies 13 As a child I couldnt pronounce the words hospital and Tylenolso I avoided

970,https://medium.com/@polyglotazren/a-week-in-review-may-21-27-2018-d038b7cc0434?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,Hi all Another week has gone by and we are just about to start another one Here is the summary of what I posted this week on my social networks As per usual there is a lot of content There were 5 blog posts 3 podcasts and 5 YouTube videos I would recommend skimming through this post and only consuming what is most relevantinteresting for you One of the hardest things about learning languages is verb conjugations Unless you are learning a language like Mandarin where verbs dont change forms it can be extremely challenging to accurately express your thoughts in the correct tense Here are a few tips that I recommend to remedy this Different strategies will work for different people so I suggest you try a few to see what is the most effective for you 1 Do writing drills For instance if you wanted to memorize all the present tense forms of the verb manger in French you would write je mange tu manges ilelleon mange vous mangez ilselles mangent repeatedly until it is engrained in your brain It is tedious and can be a painful process but for many it works 2 Keep a regular journal and have it corrected by an advanced or native speaker The daily writing practice will give you many opportunities to practice different verb conjugations and learn to use them properly with a high level of consistency 3 Read regularly This will expose you to real life examples to how different verb tenses are used It woll also familiarize you with various common verbs and the different forms they can take 4 Talk to yourself and make a specific note to use the tenses that youre finding challenging I do this when I have downtime ie when I am driving getting ready in the morning etc Doing this allows you to practice speaking even if you dont have someone to practice with 6 Watchlisten to content in your target language If you do this make sure you are paying special attention to the verb conjugationstenses that you are wanting to improve 7 Memorize key phrases only Sometimes verb tenses and conjugations feel so foreign that the brain simply cant absorb them In this scenario focus on remembering one common phrase at a time that requires the use of that conjugationtense For example in Spanish I used to struggle with remembering how to use the verb to say in the past Despite all my efforts I couldnt do it Therefore I only memorized how to say heshe said until that phrase came naturally Only then did I move on to other forms of the verb Hope this helped I dont often give advice for academic writing but I thought I would share something today A few of my students find it hard to correct their own writing and rely on me or their teacher to find their mistakes In order to make them more selfreliant Ill often give a writing checklist with a few things the student should edit by themselves BEFORE our lesson This is a checklist that one of my younger students uses An important thing to note is that the list should be adapted based on age and overall writing skill Not connected to language learning but I made Mapo Tofu today I can officially add this to the small but growing list of things I can make In hindsight this applies to various aspects of language learning not just writing Its all about engaging various senses and learning styles when learning For example using this tip where I am singing while writing helps me by engaging 1 The muscles in my hand as I write2 My ears and auditory memory3 My eyes and visual memory as I see the characters I wrote Try engaging various senses when learning a language and youll find that youll remember what you study at a deeper level Just finished doing my daily Mandarin studying Here are the main things that are standing out to me 1 Even though it has only been a week or two of practicing my stamina is increasing I can write for longer periods of time without getting tired Additionally I am remembering more and more characters by heart This reminded me that a lot of progress can be made in a short period of time if you practice daily 2 My printing is still quite messybut it is improving Unlike before most of what I write is at least legible 3 I wrote a silly story about me being unprepared for the 1st day of school to practice some new vocabulary Using stories to remember vocabulary is incredibly effective and I highly recommend it 4 In my story I rewrote any characters words and lines that I couldnt print by memory This helped me to engrain them deeper in my brain I also did not worry about being able to write anything Ive never written before and simply wrote it in English letters Hope you are all having a good weekend and thanks for

Americas language deficit a bipartisan Congressional report has called for the country to to value language education as a persistent national need similar to education in math or English and to ensure that a useful level of proficiency is within every students reach In 2018 CIA Director Gina Haspel included emphasizing foreign language excellence as part of the agencys core strategy Former CIA Director Leon Panetta recently echoed and expanded upon that sentiment in an opinion piece for the San Francisco Chronicle Panetta has been invested in language skills since the 1970s when he was a member of the Presidents Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies As he points out the Commission found that Four decades later the language gap has not been bridged and public officials remain concerned And they should be language skills are required to navigate great challenges and great opportunities not only in national security but also business and trade diplomacy global health disaster preparedness and relief and so on In 2014 a bipartisan request from Congress to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences prompted a new study of the nations language education needs In the resulting report Americas Languages Investing in Language Learning for the 21st Century the Commission recommends a national strategy to improve access to as many languages as possible for people of every region ethnicity and socioeconomic background that is to value language education as a persistent national need similar to education in math or English and to ensure that a useful level of proficiency is within every students reach Specific recommendations in the Americas Languages report focus on expanding and better funding public language education increasing the number of language teachers or supplementing through digital technology and blended learning methods supporting and expanding heritage language programs increasing support and creating more educational materials for Native American languages and encouraging and providing federal financial aid for study abroad programs A number of state and federal initiatives are aiming to meet those needs Those efforts and others like them are promising but its not enough In a recent interview ACTFL Executive Directory Marty Abbott explained that the language gap in the US is actually getting worse and enrollment in language classes is falling Only about 20 of American K12 students are enrolled in language courses compared to 92 in Europe Abbott believes attitudes have something to do with it While at the helm of ACTFL she hopes to create a new normal in which students and parents understand that English is not enough and that there is a link between language skills and future success To that end the Americas Languages report agrees While English is on the rise on a global scale the report acknowledges an emerging consensus among leaders in business and politics teachers scientists and community members that proficiency in English is not sufficient to meet the nations needs in a shrinking world nor the needs of individual citizens who interact with other peoples and cultures more than at any other time in human history This consensus has a long way to spread however Congress is considering a bill allowing computer coding languages to fulfill foreign language requirements Media outlets frequently report on a supposed cutoff age for language learning even though the research they cite concludes no such thing and publish opeds titled Should Schools Require Foreign Languages Doubtful Leaders and figureheads in this country are still sending the wrong message which if not changed will result in even lower enrollment rates among tomorrows young people Raising awareness which Abbott says is the number one way to improve language education in the US must happen at the local level Panetta puts the onus on parents educators policymakers and leaders in business in government Parents can pass down heritage languages educators and policymakers can strengthen foreign language requirements and expand course offerings and businesses can provide language training and professional development opportunities There is another group upon whom we can rely to promote languages and cultures public libraries The days of libraries housing little more than books are long gone Libraries make otherwise expensive resources freely available preserve and organize cultural collections and bring people and ideas together The modern library is a linguistic and cultural community center providing multilingual collections programming foreign movie nights and bilingual story times facilitating conversation groups offering online language learning materials and so on These services make language learning a possibility for individuals of all ages and backgrounds and can fill gaps in a communitys K12 language education offerings Foreign language instruction must be a national priority as well as an individual responsibility Language learning is our generations educational imperative If we do not instill the value of languages to todays students and provide the means to learn them to a high degree of proficiency tomorrows leaders will be facing the same language deficit that holds us back as a nation today Originally published at blogstransparentcom on

technology engineering and math are not the only or even the most valuable 21st century skills Even Google says so In the last decade American education has been increasingly concerned with promoting STEM subjects Between 2000 and 2010 the number of students enrolled in STEM degree programs increased 36 ThenPresident Obama asked Congress for a 4 billion investment in computer science in K12 schools States like Michigan now allow high school students to fulfill foreign language credit requirements by learning to code Government officials in North Carolina and Kentucky have proposed defunding nontechnical majors in state universities on the basis that they dont get someone a job The Washington Post recently reported on a 2013 Google study of its hiring firing and promotion data since 1998 The study called Project Oxygen shockingly concluded that among the eight most important qualities of Googles top employees STEM expertise comes in dead last So what came out on top The seven top characteristics of success at Google are all soft skills being a good coach communicating and listening well possessing insights into others including others different values and points of view having empathy toward and being supportive of ones colleagues being a good critical thinker and problem solver and being able to make connections across complex ideas The majority of these soft skills are byproducts of the hard skill that continues to be put on the back burner or brushed aside entirely learning a foreign language Of course the benefits and advantages afforded by foreign language study are not limited to those soft skills valued by Google and other hightech employers Parents educators and employers have many reasons to emphasize languages with the same intensity as STEM As a tech company we do not deny the necessity of STEM skills in the modern world But offering scholarships or distributing state education funds based on which degrees earn money or guarantee employment debunked by Google itself as you now know only narrows our tunnel vision CNN host Fareed Zakaria agrees arguing This dismissal of broadbased learning however comes from a fundamental misreading of the facts and puts America on a dangerously narrow path for the future The United States has led the world in economic dynamism innovation and entrepreneurship thanks to exactly the kind of teaching we are now told to defenestrate A broad general education helps foster critical thinking and creativity Exposure to a variety of fields produces synergy and cross fertilization Yes science and technology are crucial components of this education but so are English and philosophy Particularly at younger ages at least through high school an introduction to the full spectrum of technical and social sciences develops the soft skills that can be harder to learn later on Languages in particular are best started as early as possible to develop the skills and qualities so highly desired by Google You can train coders onthejob but teaching empathy Not so much Lest you think the title of this post is using Googles name as nothing more than a buzzword its not just the internet behemoth who feels this way According to NACEs Job Outlook 2016 survey and the 260 employers it surveyed important hirable attributes include written communication skills problemsolving skills verbal communication skills and a strong work ethic In fact respondents to the current survey gave slightly greater weight to verbal communication skills than was the case last year and slightly less weight to analyticalquantitative skills The increased value placed on STEM degrees unfortunately has resulted in a decrease in value for other majors While they value attributes associated with the social sciences and humanities survey respondents also indicated that academic major has the most significant influence on hiring decisions Foreign language abilities and study abroad experiences on the other hand wield not much influence This inconsistency is massively important for educators law makers parents and employers to realize Its time for employers to see the value of degrees in languages philosophy history the arts and beyond Some have already noticed billionaire investor Mark Cuban predicts a greater demand in 10 years for liberal arts majors than for programming majors and maybe even engineering Emphasizing foreign languages and other social sciences is still relevant critical even in the 21st century As the Washington Post points out even Steve Jobs infamously insisted STEM wouldnt be enough The future will require experts in the human cultural and social as well as the computational Originally published at blogstransparentcom on January 1 2018,4729, STEM is not the only

following is a guest post by David Evangelista Acting President Managing Director of the Special Olympics EuropeEurasia Region Early morning practices Evening team meetings Coach counseling Relentless training Long travel to tournaments Competition after competition Incessant logistics Athlete training and competition brings with it a myriad of additional tasks duties and responsibilities that one may not see on the medal podium but without them there simply can be no participation Behind each Special Olympics athlete there are parents and caregivers that make all of it possible In so many ways big and small present and invisible it is they that make so much of the Special Olympics Movement real The European Union and United Nations asks us to position sport not as a marketing right but as a human right Perhaps more than anything the most marginalized groups across the world consistently reiterate that sport is so much more than kicking a ball running a race or scoring a basket Within a global context defined more and more by fear and division the athletes of Special Olympics offer a stark contrast to the prevailing messages of the day instead of cynicism they play with hope Instead of greediness they play with a love of the game Instead of nationalistic rivalries they celebrate excellence in effort and bravery among all Their victory is not only the result of the same hard work that all athletes put in but also of the courage to overcome extraordinary obstacles and redefine what is possible What most distinguishes a Special Olympics athlete is that when they play they never compete with anyone but themselves Their only aim is to do one thing their best They invite others to discover the best within themselves And it is the parents and caregivers that understand the depth simplicity and power of this proposition more than anything Today on 1 June the global community is being asked to mark The Global Day of Parents proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 2012 to celebrate parents across the world In the world of Special Olympics every day is Parents Day Research shows that active involvement from parents have a strong positive effect on the academic and life skills of children with intellectual disabilities as well as on their adult lives But they cannot do it on their own EUwide platforms such as the European Alliance for Families and COFACE the Confederation of Family Organizations in the European Union of which Special Olympics is a member work on supporting parents of children with disabilities Such meaningful collaboration extends the reach of family support networks allowing parents to connect and share with one another In numbers comes strength The positive attitudes passed from one parent to another can reach across the borders of member states and enable more learning advocacy change and hope The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities CRPD recognizes the role of families in the lives of people with disabilities and serves as a milestone for the promotion and achievement of equality and human rights across Europe Various obligations under the CRPD commit policymakers to ensure families can fully and equally realize the rights enshrined in the text In Special Olympics there are thousands of parents with powerful stories to tell Giuseppe Montemurri is the father of Filippo a Special Olympics athlete with Down syndrome He remembers that shortly after Filippo was born another parent of a child with Down syndrome encouraged him by saying Your kid will be terrific if you help him in the right way This thought never left his mind As part of his commitment Giuseppe created a Special Olympics Family Support Network across Italy to involve parents in activities such as family camps and social camaraderie There was no shortage of communitybased engagement available to empower parents As a Global Family Leader for Europe Giuseppe is striving to bring more families into the Special Olympics network Anna KozakZapala is a coordinator for the Special Olympics Poland Early Childhood Development program Seven years ago she gave birth to her son Filip who was born with intellectual disabilities She discovered the Special Olympics Young Athletes Program which has transformed both of their lives Young Athletes is about sport and play but more importantly about creating the critical bonds between parent and child Having worked as a physiotherapist Anna knew this program would help her sons development and her own She took the initiative and started a Young Athletes Club in her sons kindergarten Special Olympics together with key partners like UNICEF Lions Clubs International and many more take the play of sport very seriously For children and young people with disabilities it is the electrical current that has the power to shed light on what is otherwise a life shadowed in darkness It is for many Special Olympics athletes the single opportunity to shed their labels and simply serve as a teammate a position an accepted part of the whole It is this electricity of sorts that has brought over 5000000 Special Olympics athletes with intellectual disabilities to the field to the court and to the sports complex Who creates this electrical current that brings so much energy positivity and progress to the world It is the parents and caregivers of Special Olympics athletes That is truly something at which to marvel NOTE This guest blog is crossposted on BlogActiveu,5478, The European Union and United Nations asks us to position sport not as a marketing right but as a human right . Behind each Special Olympics athlete there are parents and caregivers that make all of it possible . Without them there simply can be no participation .

blog by Dr Matthew Holder MD MBA In addition to his roles as Global Medical Advisor for Special Olympics and Global Clinical Advisor for the MedFest discipline of Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Dr Holder is the CEO of the Lee Specialty Clinic and President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry Let me win but if I cannot win let me be brave in the attempt As the Global Medical Advisor for Special Olympics I have heard this the Athlete Oath more times than I can remember Yet every time I hear it I become more inspired Not only by the meaning of the words but by the symbolism of our athletes taking that oath It is a reminder that on the path to success there are no excuses There is no acknowledgement of the limitations that others may place on you In these words there is only a relentless pursuit of giving your all and achieving your best As I write these words today there is a young mother who is living the spirit of the athlete oath on behalf of her daughter Her daughter Lily is only a few months old and is in desperate need of a transplant Under different circumstances Lily would already be on the transplant list But Lily is different The doctors believe that Lily will have an intellectual or developmental disability when she grows up and because of this she is not on the transplant list In essence the medical community has deemed her life to be less than equal to the lives of other children On a ventilator and struggling to stay alive Lily is unaware of what she symbolizes and the difference that her existence in this world may make Lilys mother is refusing to give up and she is challenging the medical system to give her daughter a chance The fight going on around Lily is emblematic of the struggle that people with intellectual disabilities face around the world every day The fight for Lilys life goes far beyond the abilities of medical science It goes beyond the availability of scarce resources The fight for Lilys life is a fight against prejudice inequality and injustice It is a fight that in no ambiguous terms shows how we treat those who are deemed with the permission of society to be of lesser value In the United States today it would be hard to fathom the public outcry if doctors refused to give a transplant to somebody because of their gender or their skin color It would be hard to imagine the public outcry if people were denied organ transplants because they didnt score high enough on an IQ test And yet here we are Lily is too young to have an IQ test but just the fear alone that she might one day have an intellectual or developmental disability is enough for the medical community to not allow her to be a candidate to receive a transplanted organ In a country that prides itself on equal protection under the law Lily is fighting for her life because she and millions of people like her are not seen as equals I have seen scores of different healthcare systems in the United States and around the world I have seen health systems in highly developed countries and in still developing nations I have seen socialized and nonsocialized systems I have viewed these systems not through the lens of some World Health Organization survey or a newspaper article or a politicians speech but through the eyes of our Special Olympics athletes Though I have seen the results of all manner of healthcare systems I have only one commonality to report there is no healthcare system in the world that provides adequate care to people with intellectual disabilities and this is precisely because in almost every society around the world people with intellectual disabilities are not held as equals In order to address this problem we have to address other factors like time education and attention This is why I am so proud of the work that is being done through the Special Olympics Health program made possible by the Golisano Foundation and specifically the focus on Healthy Communities The Healthy Communities program is seeking to change the way that people with ID are integrated into their health systems around the world one community at a time By bringing attention and visibility to the health needs of people with ID the Healthy Communities program is developing a large network of organizations and individuals who will include people with intellectual disabilities in their daily work This might mean better access to potable water in Africa a more inclusive medical school curriculum in Southeast Asia a stronger healthcare referral network in the United States better health promotion activities in Europe or better insurance coverage in Latin America But most importantly each Healthy Community is identifying the biggest barriers to health equity for people with ID and attempting to address them On this World Health Day as each of these systems changes takes hold we slowly but steadily march forward toward the goal of health equity for people with ID We continually strive to make these advancements knowing that we may not ever be satisfied with what we have accomplished but knowing that by striving we can change the world and make it a better place for people with ID and truly for all people We do this for the sake of our athletes and for children like baby Lily who we hope one day will know a world that instead of turning away from her because of her possible limitations will embrace her because of her limitless possibilities Want to help Baby Lily Sign the petition,5496, Dr Matthew Holder is Global Medical Advisor for Special Olympics and
