It allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the data and lays the foundation for successful analysis. Getting a good feeling for a new dataset is not always easy, and takes time. However, a good and thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) can help a lot to understand your dataset and get a feeling for how things are connected and what needs to be done to properly process your dataset. Infact, you probably will spend 80% of your time in data preparation and exploration and only 20% in actual data modelling. For other types of analysis, exploration might take an even larger proportion of your time. Exploratory Data Analysis, simply put, refers to the art of exploring data. It is the process of investigating data from different angles to enhance your understanding, exploring patterns, establishing relationships between variables and if required enhancing the data itself Its like going on a ‘blind’ date with your dataset, sitting across the table from this enigmatic collection of numbers and texts, yearning to understand it before embarking on a serious relationship. Just like a blind date, EDA allows you to uncover the hidden facets of your dataset. You observe patterns, detect outliers, and explore the nuances before making any significant commitments. It’s all about getting acquainted and building trust with the numbers, ensuring you’re on solid ground before drawing conclusions. We as analysts and data scientists are supposed to best understand the data. We must become the experts when it comes to understanding and interpreting the data. Whether it is machine learning models, experimentation frameworks or simple analytics — the outcome is as good as the data on which it is based. "

I used to play hurling, but now I stick to running because I enjoy the feeling of completing a run. Looking back two years, I made a risky choice to stop taking my medication and started running four times a week. I even signed up for the Clontarf half marathon, aiming to finish in under 1 hour and 30 minutes. I also took on the Clondalkin half marathon. I pushed myself hard during training, and the excitement after each run became addictive. Despite some awareness that I might be pushing too far, the thrill of setting personal records, like finishing the Clondalkin half marathon in 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 21 seconds, kept me going. Things took a turn after completing a 5k parkrun in under 19 minutes. I started feeling overly confident, signalling potential danger. With the Clontarf half marathon approaching, I had irrational thoughts of breaking the world record with a 56-minute finish. How crazy is that? On race day, my delusions peaked, believing I embodied an ancient Irish ancestor. Realising I wasn't well, a voice urged me to seek help. My wife, waiting at the finish line, got worried when I didn't show up. At home, the situation escalated, and neighbours called the police due to my erratic behaviour. After this challenging time, a moment of clarity allowed me to function again. I resumed my medication, vowing not to stop again. While I still crave the positive feeling running gives me, I recognise the importance of staying on my medication for mental health. After a year without running, I've cautiously reintroduced it into my routine, making sure to stay committed to my medication to protect against the unpredictable challenges of mania. "

Learning how to “agent” isn’t something taught in schools and most of the educational process is through firsthand experience. I find every agent’s backstory incredibly refreshing because agents (and those in the representation field) all have a different journey to the same destination. Throughout my career, I’ve worked alongside agents who once were casting directors, PAs, producers, baristas, publicists, lawyers, bakers, flight attendants and, of course, actors who all found their own unique way into representation. And while each background shapes their entry into representation, continuing education is essential to growing as an agent. As an avid reader, I turned to literature to help shape my perspective and process for advising clients from both a creative and business perspective. What I found was that a lot of these books also had applicable perspectives to help actors in their career journey as well. Here are eight books that helped shape my own knowledge of the entertainment industry and provided business insight on how to help actors stand out from the crowd while avoiding professional burnout. A new release, Burn It Down highlights many historic problems in Hollywood and how to address them moving forward. While Hollywood has experienced a lot of change in the last few years with the #MeToo, #PayUpHollywood and #OscarsSoWhite movements, Hollywood has a long way to go in removing players and practices that are detrimental to the industry. Agents and managers are in representation because we want to advocate for actors. This does not just mean finding them work opportunities. It also includes–to the best of our abilities–making sure those are safe sets with other employees who are respectful and courteous. It’s irresponsible to be working in a position of power in the entertainment industry in 2023 and not want to make the industry better than how we found it. This book provides a blueprint of how to restructure Hollywood’s structure moving forward. "

Now KBQA with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a piece of cake for any AI enthusiast. It’s fascinating to see how the realm of possibilities in NLP has expanded so rapidly due to LLMs. And it's getting better by the day. In my last article, I shared a recursive RAG approach to implement QnA with multi-hop reasoning to answer complex queries based on a large corpus of text. A good number of folks tried it out and sent their feedback. Thanks all for your feedback. I have since collated these contributions and made a few improvements to the code to address some of the problems with the original implementation. I plan to write a separate article about it. In this article, I want to share another idea that may help create a super research agent when combined with recursive RAG. The idea emerged out of my experiments with recursive RAG with smaller LLMs, and a few other ideas that I read on Medium — specifically one, the Knowledge-Graph Augmented Generation. A Knowledge Graphs (KG), or any Graph, is made up of Nodes and Edges. Each node of the KG represents a concept and each edge is a relationship between a pair of such concepts. In this article, I will share a method to convert any text corpus into a Graph of Concepts. I am using the term ‘Graph of Concept’ (GC) interchangeably with the terms KG to better describe what I am demoing here. All the components I used in this implementation can be set up locally, so this project can be run easily on a personal machine. I have adopted a no-GPT approach here because I believe in smaller open source models. I am using the fantastic Mistral 7B Openorca instruct and Zephyr models. These models can be set up locally with Ollama. Databases like Neo4j make it easy to store and retrieve graph data. Here I am using in-memory Pandas Dataframes and the NetworkX Python library, to keep things simple. Our goal here is to convert any text corpus into a Graph of Concepts (GC) and visualise it like the beautiful banner image of this article. We will even interact with the network graph by moving nodes and edges, zooming in and out, and change the physics of the graph to our heart’s desire. Here is the Github page link that shows the result of what we are building. https://rahulnyk.github.io/knowledge_graph/ But first, let’s delve into the fundamental idea of KGs and why we need them. If you are familiar with this concept already, feel free to skip the next section. Consider the following text. Mary had a little lamb,You’ve heard this tale before;But did you know she passed her plate,And had a little more! (I hope the kids are not reading this 😝) Here is one possible representation of the text as a KG. The following article from IBM aptly explains the fundamental concept of Knowledge Graphs. Quoting an excerpt from the article to summarise the idea: Knowledge Graphs are useful in a variety of ways. We can run graph algorithms and calculate the centralities for any node, to understand how important a concept (node) is to the body of work. We can analyse connected and disconnected sets of concepts, or calculate communities of concepts for a deep understanding of the subject matter. We can understand links between seemingly disconnected concepts. We can also use knowledge graphs to implement Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG or GAG) and chat with our documents. This can give us much better results than the plain old version of RAG, which suffers several shortcomings. For example, retrieving the context that is the most relevant for the query with a simple semantic similarity search is not always effective. Especially, when the query does not provide enough context about its true intent, or when the context is fragments across a large corpus of text. For example, consider this query — Tell me about the family tree of José Arcadio Buendía in the book ‘One Hundred years of Solitude’. The book documents 7 generations of José Arcadio Buendía with half of the characters named José Arcadio Buendía. It will be quite a challenge, if even possible, to answer the query using a simple RAG pipeline. Another shortcoming of RAG is that it can’t tell you what to ask. Very often, asking the right question is more important that getting the answers. Graph Augmented generation (GAG) can address these shortcomings of RAG up to some extent. Better still, we can mix and match and build a Graph Augmented Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline to get the best of both worlds. So now we know that Graphs are interesting, they can be extremely useful, and they also look beautiful. If you were to ask GPT, how to create a graph of knowledge from a given text? it may suggest a process like the following. Steps 3 and 4 sound understandable. But how do you achieve steps 1 and 2? Here is a flow diagram of the method I devised to extract a graph of concepts from any given text corpus. It is similar to the above method but for a few minor differences. You can see the implementation of this method as a Python code, in the GitHub repository I share in this article. Let us briefly walk through the key ideas of the implementation in the next few sections. To demonstrate the method here, I am using the following review article published in PubMed/Cureus under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License. Credit to the authors at the end of this article. Step 1 in the above flow chart is easy. Langchain provides a plethora of text splitters we can use to split our text into chunks. Step 2 is where the real fun starts. To extract the concepts and their relationships, I am using the Mistral 7B model. Before converging on the variant of the model best suited for our purpose, I experimented with the following: Mistral InstructMistral OpenOrca, and Zephyr (Hugging Face version derived from Mistral) I used the 4-bit quantised version of these models — So that my Mac doesn’t start hating me — hosted locally with Ollama. These models are all instruction-tuned models with a system prompt and a user prompt. They all do a pretty good job at following the instructions and formatting the answer neatly in JSONs if we tell them to. After a few rounds of hit and trial, I finally converged on to the Zephyr model with the following prompts. If we pass our (not fit for) nursery rhyme with this prompt, here is the result. Notice, that it even guessed ‘food’ as a concept, which was not explicitly mentioned in the text chunk. Isn’t this wonderful! If we run this through every text chunk of our example article and convert the json into a Pandas data frame, here is what it looks like. Every row here represents a relation between a pair of concepts. Each row is an edge between two nodes in our graph, and there can be multiple edges or relationships between the same pair of concepts. The count in the above data frame is the weight that I arbitrarily set to 4. I assume that the concepts that occur close to each other in the text corpus are related. Let’s call this relation ‘contextual proximity’. To calculate the contextual proximity edges, we melt the dataframe so that node_1 and node_2 collapse into a single column. Then we create a self-join of this dataframe using the chunk_id as the key. So nodes that have the same chunk_id will pair with each other to form a row. But this also means that each concept will also be paired with itself. This is called a self-loop, where an edge starts and ends on the same node. To remove these self-loops, we will drop every row where node_1 is the same as node_2 from the dataframe. In the end, we get a dataframe very similar to our original dataframe. The count column here is the number of chunks where node_1 and node_2 occur together. The column chunk_id is a list of all these chunks. So we now have two dataframes, one with the semantic relation, and another with the contextual proximity relation between concepts mentioned in the text. We can combine them to form our network graph dataframe. We are done building a graph of concepts for our text. But to leave it at this point will be quite an ungratifying exercise. Our goal is to visualise the Graph just like the featured image at the beginning of this article, and we are not far from our goal. NetworkX is a Python library that makes dealing with graphs super easy. If you are not already familiar with the library, click their logo below to learn more Adding our dataframe to a NetworkX graph is just a few lines of code. This is where we can start harnessing the power of Network Graph. NetworkX provides a plethora of network algorithms out of the box for us to use. Here is a link to the list of algorithms we can run on our Graph. Here, I use a community detection algorithm to add colours to the nodes. Communities are groups of nodes that are more tightly connected with each other, than with the rest of the graph. Communities of concepts can give us a good idea of broad themes discussed in the text. The Girvan Newman algorithm detected 17 communities of concept in the Review Article we are working with. Here is one such community. This immediately gives us an idea about the broad theme of health technologies discussed in the review paper and enables us to ask questions that we can then answer with our RAG Pipeline. Isn’t that great? Let us also calculate the degree of each concept in our graph. The degree of a node is the total number of edges it is connected with. So in our case, the higher the degree of a concept, the more central it is to the subject of our text. We will use the degree as the size of the node in our visualisation. Visualisation is the most fun part of this exercise. It has a certain quality to it that gives you an artistic gratification. I am using the PiVis library to create interactive graphs. Pyvis is a Python library for visualizing networks. Here is a medium article that demonstrates the ease and the power of the Library Pyvis has a built-in NetworkX Helper to translate our NetworkX graph into PyVis Objects. So we need no more coding…. Yay!! Remember, we have already calculated the weights of each edge for the thickness of the edge, the communities of nodes for their colour, and the degree of each node as their size. So, with all these bells and whistles, here is our graph. Link to the interactive graph: https://rahulnyk.github.io/knowledge_graph/ We can zoom in and out and move nodes and edges as we wish. We also have slider pannel at the bottom of the page to change the physics of the graph. See how the graph can help us ask the right questions and understand the subject matter better! We can further discuss how our graph can help us build Graph Augmented Retrieval and how that can help us build a better RAG pipeline. But I think it’s better to leave it for another day. We have achieved our goal for this article already! Contributions and suggestions most welcome I have used the following article for the demonstration of my code.

We’ll be using an AI generator that barely anyone ever talks about it. And I’m pretty sure this story is going to leave your jaws dropped. Now, most of the side hustles I share are very simple, in terms of the structure and steps you need to follow. If you can use the tips I share to focus on a specific keyword in a smaller market, you’ll make money for sure. How many of us are fashionistas or love a good fabric pattern? Well what if I told you it was possible to start out your own fashion line with almost no effort. Yeah, I’m serious. And no, I’m not writing this story just for the fashionistas, there’s room for everyone with this side hustle. The best part is that I’ll be sharing highly popular online platforms, where you can sell these patterns to generate a steady stream of passive income. Now remember, the images we’re talking about are patterns So, we’ll be generating these patterns to sell online using AI art generatorsm And for this, allow me to introduce Creative Fabrica Spark. First, we need the ideas or niches. Simply head over to ChatGPT and ask for pattern ideas that can be generated with AI. Now, these are quite broad niche ideas, so let’s narrow them down a bit. Ask ChatGPT to give you 10–20 sub niches for your favorite category. Now that we have the ideas we need, let’s head over to Creative Fabrica Spark. So Creative Fabrica Spark is a suite of AI tools but we’re particularly interested in its pattern generator. So once you choose the pattern generator, it’s time to start generating. You can copy-paste this simple prompt & replace it with your specific idea to generate the pattern of your choice. Now, Here’s the pattern I generated with Creative Fabrica Spark using this same prompt. I don’t know about you but this pattern is pretty amazing. Now, With the ideas from ChatGPT and a tool like creative Fabrica Spark, you’ll be able to generate endless images and patterns to sell online. This has to be the most important part of this story, so pay attention. You guys loved Zazzle the last time I talked about it. So here’s another idea for you. At least this time, AI is doing almost everything for you. Now, Zazzle gets over 24.2 million visitors per month. On Zazzle, you just need to upload a digital copy of your pattern on products like Zazzle will then handle the entire shipping costs and customer service while you make passive income. Creating a Zazzle shop is free, and I found a seller who was making a pretty sustainable income of over $7,000 per month. This is another lesser known print on demand website, which means less competition and more sales for you. Don’t be deceived, Society 6 gets over 3.3 Million visitors every month and works just like Zazzle. Moreso, I found a seller who made $7,091 selling patterns on Society 6. Sounds familiar right? Creative Fabrica, Creative Fabrica Spark! Yeah, they’re the same website. So you can basically create and sell patterns on the same marketplace. The only difference is that you won’t be selling your pattern as a physical product but instead as a digital product that can either be In fact in my creative Fabrica shop, I sell AI generated patterns as bundles alongside my Canva templates. AI is getting better and better everyday. Before now, it would have taken a super skilled designer to make a pattern like what we generated. Now, with just a simple prompt, AI does it all. But wait! I got way too excited about this new found side hustle, that I almost forgot to mention something important. Well, I couldn’t also justify spending $19 on the subscription for this side hustle. So, I found a Black Friday deal. For that $1, Note: There are affiliate links in the article and if you buy something, I’ll get a commission at no extra cost to you.

These are custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can build on their own for a specific purpose. The best thing about them? No coding is required to build them. Creating your own GPT is as easy as starting a conversation with ChatGPT and you can make it for yourself, for your company, or for everyone (with the chance to even make money in the official GPT store) I know all this sounds too good to be true, so let’s dive in and see all about GPTs in more detail. Custom instructions is a ChatGPT feature that was introduced back in July with the purpose of generating better responses based on information about us and how we’d like ChatGPT to respond. Custom instructions helped us control ChatGPT to some degree, but it wasn’t enough to produce our own ChatGPT and it wasn’t possible to save multiple custom instructions either. GPTs take all this to the next level. GPTs are a combination of instructions, extra knowledge, and any combination of skills (web browsing, DALL-E 3, code interpreter). Here’s a picture of what it looks like to create a GPT. Besides the instructions section we’re familiar with, there’s a knowledge section where we can upload files to customize our GPT even further and the capabilities section where we can enable features for our GPT such as web browsing, DALL-E 3, and the code interpreter. Once you create your GPT you can share it with the world in the GPT Store that will roll out later in November and make money from it based on how many people are using your GPT (at least that’s what OpenAI says). What type of GPT can you create? "

Now, this agency is extremely technical with significant development resources. In fact, the principals even run a tech podcast with thousands of followers. Now what would make them abandon their “Do It Yourself” approach with Langchain? For the same reason you would not run a server in your basement (you would use Amazon AWS!), trying to build and run your own RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system means that you now become the proud owner of dealing with all the production-related issues. When I jumped on the call, it became obvious what the issues were. Lets get started: Dealing with hallucinations requires putting in anti-hallucination measures at each and every step of the RAG pipeline. Hallucinations is not a simple “add this to the prompt” type of thing. For every design decision you make in the entire pipeline — from data ingestion to final response — you need to ask yourself “How does this affect hallucinations?” — we’ve seen this the hard way dealing with thousands of customers. Hallucinations alone would have taken thousands of engineering manhours in our system (See why). The second big killer is: Data ingestion. On paper, ingesting PDFs sounds simple. But then when you get into production use and you are importing 1000s of documents and webpages, does the ingestion work seamlessly? Is each document accountable with a clear audit log? Is the pipeline resilient to failures? How do you refresh or re-process a document? While all the media attention is on AI, when it comes to running a production RAG pipeline, the silent killer is actually data ingestion. There is a reason data ingestion takes up almost 40% of our engineering time. It’s because every data format and data source has it’s own set of intricacies. For example, try ingesting Youtube videos. You will quickly notice the nightmare that is. There is a reason that Langchain has FIVE different PDF parsers. Nobody knows which one to use and under what conditions. Those design decisions nicely fall into developer hands. Cross your fingers and hope everything works. The good news with Langchain is that you can quickly prototype and show off results in a very short time. Sweeet! And then you try to demo it to your boss or CEO and the first question is “Where did that response come from?” or “How was that response computed?” or (even worse!) “Wait — that makes no sense at all!” The solution: Clear citations and sources around the responses. Langchain does not build this for you — you have to yourself build a citation algorithm and show transparency and trust around the responses. While most tutorials around RAG pipelines deal with the “Happy Case”, in real life, user’s dont know how to query. They enter queries like “Hmm — ok”, “yeah, tell me more”, “2”, “yes”, “that one”, “ok — yeah” and more. Unless you’ve clearly built a process around understanding the query intent, normal users are going to chat with the chatbot like they regularly do on Livechat to a real human. We see this ourselves in our bot. Even worse: Some users just don’t know how to hold a conversation. Their minds get blocked even though they have clear needs. Does your bot know how to engage the user and lead him towards satisfaction? (NPS scores!) So this part is mostly overlooked, but each time OpenAI comes up with a new feature or releases a new model (e.g. June 13th release), how does your RAG pipeline get affected? This was quite frustrating because we had to hunt down the reason and get it fixed (Side note: It was some single word we were using in the `system` message) But this is not the only thing. How do you deal with rate limiting issues? Or API downtime issues? And best of all: The investigations when the customer or the boss says “Hey, why is the bot responding like this for this question?” The reason we all love cloud platforms like AWS is: The huge cost of developing them is spread out across millions of customers. And so we get a nice AWS instance for much less than the TCO cost of running it ourselves. Same is true of the OpenAI API as well. OpenAI spent the millions to build the LLM and we now all get it for a pay-for-use cost of $1 (or less) When OpenAI fixes an issue in their LLM, we all get the benefit of it. When there is an issue in your self-developed RAG pipeline, you bear the full development cost yourself. This is why running Langchain in production is so expensive — every little issue has to be debugged by you and your team! For example: We spent a couple of 100s of engineering hours fixing our Youtube video ingestion pipeline. Now our thousands of customers ALL get the benefit of it — for pennies, NOT tens of thousands of dollars. One of the benefits of Langchain is that you get to control the data security of your documents. And so it gives you the ability to run Langchain within your own VPC or on-premise infrastructure. That is indeed great. However, there are 3 aspects to security and you will need to consider ALL 3 of them. In particular: 1. Data Security: The ingestion and subsequent deletion of your documents and resources. Plus the at-rest security of your chunks and vectors. In addition, if you need PII removal and/or anonymization, that is something you will need to implement too. Nothing too difficult, but you will need to build it out. 2. Chat Security: If the chatbot is being used by untrusted users, do you have chat security built in? In particular, NSFW queries or jailbreaking attempts? 3. Chat Access Security : Now that you have the chatbot built, who can access it? Do you have SSO built? Or a Teams access feature? Who gets access and is that logged and audited? Will you be building out an entire access control system? The biggest impediment to Gen AI deployment these days are CISOs (Chief Information Security Officer) blocking deployments (there is just too much FUD!). Has your deployment plan included full audit trails to see what the AI is saying and other aspects of access? Or on a positive front: Do you plan on implementing a dashboard and analytics to glean insights from the chat logs? (specially when the boss or other stakeholders ask “Hey, can you tell me what’s going on in the bot?”) Last but not least, who would be responsible for ongoing maintenance and continued development as technologies evolve. OpenAI (and others) seem to be releasing new features almost weekly. Who keeps on top of this and incorporates the new features (or even worse, sun setting) after your solution has been deployed? While Langchain is really nice to get started and an excellent educational tool, it is NOT designed to take real-life use cases into production. For the same reason you would not go down to Radioshack to assemble your own server, building your own RAG pipeline is akin to that. While fun to do, when push comes to shove and it’s time for real production use, running your own RAG system is just like buying each part of a computer and trying to assemble it yourself. Yeah — we did that decades ago — now we just buy from Dell or Apple. The author is CEO @ CustomGPT, a no-code/low-code cloud RAG platform that let’s any business build RAG chatbots with their own content. This blog post is based upon experiences working with thousands of business customers over the last 8 months (since the ChatGPT API was introduced). "

I’ll try to break down my high-level analysis block by block below. Unknown to me at a first glance: After reading through the resource: Not complex to understand. It’s related to a space and its subspace based on a certain equivalence relation built on the subspace. Let’s keep going, this first part reminds me of my first year after high school in MPSI (intense maths program in France). This second block looks a little bit more advanced at a first glance. I do remember Hadamard matrices (I don’t remember how relevant they are in practice to be honest). Let me share the summary instead of my own words regarding this second block. What I can say is that it was very heavy, and in 30 mins, no time for me to go through every statement. It looks rather exhaustive to me. Very scholar indeed. Nothing to add. Probably good to read through it at some point, but if you already saw that in your early days, not essential to me. Let’s keep going. "

Let’s focus on this resource for 30 minutes, again. In the last article, I essentially went throug the first chapter of this heavy online book. The reason I did that is because I saw it several times being shared as a “must read” in Machine Learning. The general takeaway from last time is that it would take us ages to go through every chapter one by one. Hence, I said I decided to have a different approach and go through the sections I think are relevant for Machine Learning based on my personal experience. Next time, I will ask some friends in the industry what they think about it so that we have a better estimate of what should be read deeper in the above book. My take from Chapter 1 on Linear Algebra. What follow are chapters I find important for ML. 9. Vector Norms and Matrix Norms [page 319] — get intuition about the different norms. I do think it’s really important. An example below on norms in the euclidean space and their relationship. 12. Euclidean Spaces [page 433] Why? An absolute must as we typically use vector representations for the observations in a Machine Learning problem. Given a textual input, we use embeddings and typically use the euclidean distance to compare two textual entities which should be preserving the more intuitive semantic distance. Euclidean spaces is what is the closest to our human intuition. However, I know there is investment in non-euclidean approaches. Quick note. I did come across hyperbolic word embeddings. I am not extremely familiar with this space as the latest I have seen in my studies was around Hilbertian spaces. I may leverage this series to check more on the non-euclidean spaces. Let’s do it together! 14. Hermitian Spaces [page 509] Why? Useful to get intuition of distances (scalar products) on more complex spaces. I find it introduced heavily (rigorously but heavily) in this book. Have a look at this video from Yuly: 15. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalue [page 549] Why? Important to understand for example PCA and other similar methods to compress data in a more meaningful space. This “meaningful space” often involves using the base of eigenvectors. It is hence important to understand those objects, and even have some geometric understanding. I may focus on the latter in one of my articles, I wanted to do that for a long time. 22. Singular Value Decomposition and Polar Form [page 725] Why? I highlited this one, mostly because I work in the NLP space and I have seen SVD being used. It can be useful for dimensionality reduction using another base involving eigenvectors. 23. Applications of SVD and Pseudo-Inverses [page 747] Why? An example of what I am highlighting above. Chapter 2 is about Affine and Projective Geometry — during my bachelor years I haven’t done much geometry. Though as I grew older and getting more experience, I have consistently tried to link my knowledge in algebra to something more intuitive, i.e. geometry. Indeed, geometry is more explainable to a random person than citing theorems and lemmas. My advice to the Data Scientists out there is to go through this rather hard journey to get more intuition with the mathematical objects in hand. It takes time but it is very rewarding. Sharing is essential and it requires manipulating the concepts so well that you are able to explain them with more simple objects, such as basic geometrical shapes. For example, I do that a lot when teaching NLP. My time is up here. Next time we will go through Chapter 2 and the following sections. We will try to see if there is something that is indeed clearly linkable to an area of investment in ML for the industry/research. 24 Basics of Affine Geometry 25 Embedding an Affine Space in a Vector Space 26 Basics of Projective Geometry Thanks for your time!

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads.

The dataset can be found here. Walmart is one of the biggest retailers and among the go-to retail stores for one’s household shopping. Known for its lowest prices and cost savings across product categories, a visit to its physical stores is an experience in itself. It is a retail business that generates USD 567 billion worth of sales volume. Walmart has a Data Science and Analytics department that is dedicated to improving customer-client-employee relationships by forecasting sales, recommending products based on customer buying trends, product/customer segmentation, and several other use cases of data science. In 2014, Walmart hosted a recruiting competition on Kaggle. Job-seekers were provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and we are tasked with predicting the department-wide sales for each store. In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. The business problem I am trying to solve is to forecast future sales data by training machine learning models on historical data. Sales forecasting helps every business make better business decisions. It helps in overall business planning, budgeting, and risk management. It allows companies to efficiently allocate resources for future growth and manage their cash flow. Sales forecasting also helps businesses to estimate their costs and revenue accurately based on which they are able to predict their short-term and long-term performance. Type and size of 45 stores Data related to the store, department, and regional activity like fuel price, customer price index, unemployment rate, etc. for the given dates The historical training data cover dates in the range 2010–02–05 to 2012–11–01. Weekly Sales is a labeled continuous numeric feature. Hence, this is an application of Supervised ML, specifically, it is a regression problem. Preparing historical store sales data by cleaning, transforming, and encoding categorical variables as necessary. Perform feature engineering and feature selection. Heatmap of the correlation matrix Weekly Sales vs. Week of Year Weekly Sales vs. Month of Year Weekly Sales vs. Day of Month Weekly Sales vs. Quarter Average Weekly Sales vs. Store Weekly Sales vs. Store Type Temperature vs. Weekly Sales Weekly Sales vs IsHoliday Weekly Sales vs Store Size and Store Type Weekly Sales vs. Department In this section, I have performed the following tasks Since this is a regression problem, I shall set LinearRegression() model as my baseline ML model. I have additionally trained Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, and SGDRegressor in order to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the performance of all linear models offered by Sklearn. I have created a function try_linear_models(model) that takes in the model as input, performs training on training data, and returns the training and validation root mean squared errors. We see that the linear models on average returns RMSE scores of ~$20,000. This is a very poor performance by our baseline ML models as ~20,000 is around the 75th percentile of weekly sales. The model r2 score is very low and therefore I do not find it necessary to investigate the linear models further. I have trained ensemble models like random forest, gradient boosting, adaboost, XGBoost, and LightGBM with default parameters as an initial check to see which models have better evaluation score. I have created a function try_ensemble_methods() which takes in the model as input and returns the evaluation metrics. There are the evaluation scores — The top three performing models are Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM and therefore I will go ahead with hyperparameter tuning for these models. AdaBoost performs as poorly as the linear models. The hyperparameter tuning is evaluated based on weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) . I created a dictionary called models with hyper-parameters and values to test. Functions test_params() and test_param_and_plot() trained the models for each of these hyperparameters and returned the evaluation scores for each run. The overfitting curves for random forest hyperparameter tuning are — The overfitting curves for XGBoost hyperparameter tuning are — The overfittng curves for LightGBM hyperparameter tuning are — I find that after hyperparameter tuning, the model that works best with this data is Random Forest. From hyperparameter tuning, random forest seems to work the best — it provides the best validation scores ~2000. Further, I used the GridSearchCV to obtain the best fit random forest model. Am I satisfied/confident with this model? NO. Did I learn how to implement an end-to-end ML project? YES. Better sales forecasting can be performed by employing time-series modeling techniques like ARIMA. The top predictions in kaggle have all employed some form of time-series techniques. This project can be improved by doing so. Applications of time series forecasting are web traffic forecasting, sales and demand forecasting, weather prediction, stock price forecasting, among others. It is an important branch of machine learning and more companies employ time-series modeling in some form or another. It is therefore crucial for a budding data scientist to be familiar with this concept. I would like to thank jovian.ai, especially Aakash, for providing excellent learning materials as part of the data science and machine learning bootcamp. Most of the code is inspired from the bootcamp tutorials and ChatGPT of course. "

When spoken convincingly these short, loaded phrases can turn around our inner speech, change our view of the world, and impact our lives. Unlocking the Science Behind AffirmationsThe ability of affirmations to work is grounded in neuroscience. We can even develop these new neural pathways by merely repeating some positive phrase or statement to ourselves. Neuroplasticity is the concept used here to explain the flexibility of the brain to accept new, empowering stories. Crafting Your AffirmationsAffirmations as an art is subjective and evolving. A good affirmation should be in the present tense, positive, and specific. This has to be in line with your moral fiber and objectives. As an example, “I am a competent and expressive speaker” leaves a greater impression compared to “I should be okay.” Integrating Affirmations into Daily LifeAffirmations should be woven into the fabrics of your daily routines. Start your day by making an oral proclamation of your affirmations. It is meant to serve as the first step in the morning ritual that sets the day’s right tune.

For some months, It just wasted my time as all the websites on which I was trying to make money were fake and they were just promoted by the YouTubers. I remember one day, I found a website that was giving 25$ for every referral and I was super excited that I could earn from it. It had a withdrawal limit of 160$ so I completed 160$ by making referrals with the help of relative accounts. When I completed 160$, the website expired my login. It was so embarrassing. Then how I made my first money online? Fiverr made this happen for me. As I told you, I was trying every method so I tried the Fiverr freelancing platform, made a gig and I was waiting for my first order. Let me be clear, it took me 6 months to get my first order on Fiverr. And guess what, when I opened my account, it said the order had been canceled as I opened my Fiverr account after a long time. But luckily, the next week, I got an order again. I completed it and finally, I made money online. Isn’t easy? No, It’s not. You have to be patient, and consistent and must be an action-taker to make money online. "

The options seem endless, ranging from fresh, natural foods to tempting, convenient junk food. This article delves into the fundamental differences between natural and junk food, exploring their impact on health, lifestyle, and overall well-being. In a society where time is a precious commodity, the convenience of junk food often clashes with the desire for wholesome, natural nourishment. Understanding the implications of these choices is crucial for maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Natural foods, sourced from the earth, offer a symphony of nutrients essential for our body's optimal functioning. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provide a rich tapestry of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. This section explores the benefits of incorporating natural foods into our diets, emphasizing their positive impact on energy levels, immune function, and disease prevention. On the flip side, the allure of junk food lies in its accessibility and instant gratification. This section uncovers the hidden pitfalls of indulging in processed snacks, sugary treats, and fast food. From the potential for weight gain to the impact on mental health, it's crucial to recognize the risks associated with excessive consumption of these tempting… "

At its core, the LoA suggests that our thoughts and feelings magnetize and attract corresponding events and circumstances in our lives. However, merely understanding this principle isn’t enough. It’s essential to recognize the intertwined relationship between our vibrational state, acceptance of opportunities, and the real essence of the LoA. Everything in the universe, from the vast galaxies to our intricate emotions, operates on vibration. Each thought, emotion, or action has a specific vibrational frequency. To truly harness the LoA, one must focus on elevating their vibrational state. Why? One of the main misconceptions about the LoA is the notion that simply wanting something will bring it into one’s life. This perspective is not just limiting; it’s misleading. The LoA is less about attracting what we want and more about becoming a vibrational match to the experiences and opportunities we wish to invite into our lives. When we operate from a higher vibrational state, the universe doesn’t just hand us our desires wrapped in a bow. Instead, it presents opportunities that align with our new vibrational frequency. Recognizing and accepting these opportunities is… "

But what about the “now”? That elusive, ever-present sliver of time that seems to slip away even as we try to grasp it. This article explores the profound importance of truly living in the present moment and offers simple exercises to help you hone this invaluable skill. They say the present is called “present” because it’s a gift. And it truly is. The “now” is where life happens. Not in yesterday’s regrets or tomorrow’s dreams, but right here, in this very moment. The sounds, the feelings, the breath you just took — that’s life in its purest form. The past, with its collection of memories, can sometimes feel like a safety net. It’s known and familiar. The future, on the other hand, is a realm of possibilities, hopes, and fears. While it’s natural to reflect and dream, getting too wrapped up in either can rob us of the joy of now. When you’re truly present, life seems richer. Colors are more vivid, sounds more profound, and experiences more meaningful. That’s because being in the moment allows us to fully engage with life, to truly connect with the world around us and with ourselves. a. Mindful Breathing: Take a moment to close your eyes and focus solely on your breath. Feel the air entering and leaving your nostrils or mouth. Notice the rise and fall of your chest. Do this for a few minutes every day. It’s simple yet incredibly grounding. b. Sensory Engagement: Choose one of your senses to focus on. Maybe it’s taste during a meal, truly savoring each bite. Or perhaps it’s touch, feeling the textures around you. By honing in on one sense at a time, you anchor yourself to the moment. c. Nature Walks: Take a walk outside. It doesn’t have to be anywhere special — a park… "

It feels like history repeating itself for a brief moment. It’s déjà vu. This phenomenon has perplexed scientists, psychologists, and laypeople alike for ages. But what if the secret to understanding déjà vu lies not in our past but our dreams? Déjà vu, French for “already seen,” is a phenomenon where a person feels that an event or situation has happened before. Despite the strong sense of familiarity, it’s often challenging to pinpoint the exact memory or instance being recalled. Many believe that dreams are not just random sequences of images but glimpses into various realities or possibilities. They might even contain moments from our near future. If someone can remember these dreams vividly, it provides an exciting avenue to understand déjà vu better. “I am not a scientist, but I remember my dreams with striking clarity.” For those who recall dreams with a high degree of detail, it’s not uncommon to identify moments from their waking life that mirror sequences from their dreams. These moments, when reconciled with real-life events, might give déjà vu its surreal quality. Although we’ve yet to understand dreams entirely, some scientific theories touch on their predictive nature: "

Within its corridors lie thoughts that guide us, mislead us, and shape our very perceptions of reality. Often, we are entrapped by these transient thoughts, mistaking them for our genuine essence. To navigate life’s journey with clarity and purpose, it’s crucial to distinguish between the ephemeral nature of thoughts and the intentional act of thinking. Why are thoughts so captivating? They resonate with our fears, aspirations, and insecurities, offering an illusionary reality where our ego is the protagonist. But there’s a revelation to be made: no thought, no matter how profound, holds an absolute truth. They are mere reflections, often distorted, of our internal and external worlds. Many of us become so intertwined with our thoughts that we lose our authentic selves. Thoughts like “I’m not good enough” or “I always fail” become internalized narratives. But remember, you are not your thoughts. Identifying with them is surrendering to the ego’s illusions. "

I am sure not too long. I am noticing an aspect of my personality over the past few years. I buy something after a long wait with felicity. Then I give my whole attention to that thing for some time. But gradually that thing starts losing my attention and its value. Eventually, I ended up substituting that thing. Nowadays I am planning to buy a new phone and it’s too costly. I have been saving to buy that phone for a long time. Yesterday I was sitting alone in my room and thinking should I buy that pricey phone by investing a large amount of my hard-earned money? I was thinking about my attitude towards life. Some questions came to my mind after meditating for almost two hours; Do I lose the value of costly and cheap items like the same? Is this materialistic approach the same for the relations in my life? Is this attitude towards life suitable? I came to a conclusion that I want to share with you all. I concluded that this attitude is not confined to just things, it is more than that. We all value someone in our lives so much initially. But gradually our love and attention start fading for that person. Eventually, we break up just because of our false approach. But this attitude is greatly harmful and mean. I want to give some pieces of advice to all of you from my experience. 1: Don’t invest a large amount of your hard-earned money to buy a single item. Because things lose their value gradually. 2: Avoid this approach towards relationships. Try to give more attention and value with time and ignore mistakes rather than parting ways. 3: Make financial decisions wisely. Try to invest your hard-earned money for growth rather than over-spending. Be happy and maintain a wise approach towards life! "

The years I have spent searching, crestfallen at the evaporating burn that I was designed to be abandoned and hopeless in my quest for her. “I finally found you,” a whisper I secretly trusted to find her ears by a lonely draft. It is through the windowpane I hear uneven breaths translate into soft moans guided by the steady pace of her hands. I observed several desperate attempts, hips buckling, legs thrashing, and the faint cries mere of her frustration. “Oh, not ever will you concern yourself with this.” My heart fluttered, dampening sweet sorrows in the thin fabric between my thighs. A taste — I sulked for years longing on the desire just to flee underneath the tired beam, breaking streams of fading moonlight. Human. How fragile she would be after I sink my canines deep between her neck and collarbone. “Fuck!” She’s defeated, hard scowl and clenched jaw, a nearby tree suffered our agony. I retracted my claws as sudden footsteps compelled me to retreat further into the shadows. There goes her eyes, maneuvering the night’s desolate circus. Arms pressed against the windowsill, she’s staring, unblinking, and for a while, I watch. A slight glimmer, and a stray tear ride over her cheek before a fit of uncontrollable sobs. I looked down at my hand caressing the sharp sting ringing through my chest. A naked palm instinctively reached. Crunch.

From its remarkable architecture to its significance in trade and commerce, religion and culture, Ephesus is a true testament to the achievements of ancient civilizations. In this article, we will delve into the various aspects of Ephesus and discover why it continues to captivate visitors from all around the world. Ancient City of Ephesus The ancient city of Ephesus dates back to the 10th century BC, although it reached its peak during the Roman Empire. It was renowned for being one of the largest and most important cities of the ancient world. With a population that exceeded 250,000 people, it was a bustling metropolis with a thriving economy and a vibrant cultural scene. Ephesus was home to some of the most significant architectural wonders of its time, including the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Location and Geography Situated on the Aegean coast of Turkey, near the modern-day town of Selçuk, Ephesus boasted a strategic location. It was positioned on the crossroads of important trade routes, making it a hub for commerce and cultural exchange. The city was also blessed with a naturally protected harbor, which further enhanced its status as a significant trading center. Importance of Ephesus in History Ephesus played a crucial role in the history of various ancient civilizations. From being a prominent city in the Ionian League to becoming a regional capital during the Roman era, Ephesus witnessed numerous historical events and transformations.

In our case, it is true. While my partner is a driven, vibrant, and outgoing individual, I, on the other hand, am quiet, reserved, and not inclined to overt displays of excitement or enthusiasm. I am one of those who are clueless about gracefully handling good news probably because I feel I don’t deserve it or that it may have mistakenly come my way. Also, I have this annoying tendency to approach things with a veneer of pessimism and am reluctant to grant myself permission to hope because I have experienced the hurt hope can bring. I am sure this behavior has come across as perplexing. Perhaps even a tad frustrating although my partner seems unfazed by it or even if he does, never lets on. Next week, we are embarking on our first vacation together as a couple. Even though this has been weeks in the planning, the truth is I did not give myself permission to hope that this wonderful event really is happening. It was only when a close friend called me up and asked me how my preparations were coming along that it struck me that I had not done much. In fact, every time my mind forayed into the realm of daydreaming, I’d deny myself those joy-filled moments out of fear. Fear that said moments would never come to fruition. Fear that I would jinx something beautiful, something that I crave with every fiber of my being just for permitting myself to envision what could be.

A terrifying story of survival, tenacity, and the resilience of the human spirit transpired. People all throughout the world are still motivated to be resilient and resourceful by the inspirational narrative of these survivors. This a story like no other. Everything was against them but still some survived. The Uruguayan Air Force’s Flight 571 was travelling from Montevideo, Uruguay, to Santiago, Chile when it experienced extreme turbulence and crashed into a secluded area of the Andes. The collision left the passengers and crew stranded in subfreezing temperatures at an elevation of more than 12,000 feet, without access to food, clothes, or equipment. The survivors of the crash faced unfathomable difficulties once it happened. They had to decide between their lives and death because there was not enough food and there was no sign of a rescue. They suffered famine, frostbite, and avalanches over a period of seventy-two days. The passengers had to take drastic measures to make it through these harsh conditions. Even writing this I feel goosebumps and cannot even imagine how the passengers went through this. CAUTION GRAPHIC DETAILS AHEAD : When food ran out the survivors had to eat human meat of their own family and friends. But the survival of the passengers left us with some lessons that we can ponder upon. The survivors realized very quickly that they had to change to fit into their new surroundings. They made clothes out of seat covers, used the debris of the aero plane to build a shelter, and even used the broken parts to melt snow and get drinking water. This inventiveness demonstrates how resilient people can be when faced with challenges. 2.

During this time the iconic statue was still being assembled by the French engineer; Gustave Eiffel. The iconic statue of Lady Liberty was revealed to everyone who came to its ceremony on 28th October 1886. There were numerous rumors of him using goat feces as a perfume which are definitely absurd however there’s an image of him enjoying a ride in a goat carriage which is literally drawn by a goat!

That warm, comforting blanket we wrap ourselves in, especially when the world feels cold and alienating. It’s like the aged scotch in Grandpa’s hidden flask — smooth, intoxicating, and steeped in history. Yet sometimes, that very same culture can act like the jagged rocks you didn’t see as you swam in the sea of life, cutting you when you least expect it. One of those sharp rocks, ladies and gentlemen, is misogyny dressed up as “traditional values.” When we hear phrases like “traditional values,” it’s easy to conjure images of simpler times, where people had roles, knew their places, and everything was supposedly “right” with the world. Ah, yes — the good ol’ days, where we imagine that everyone lived in harmony, unaware that harmony often came at a steep price. What some folks don’t seem to understand — or choose not to — is that this so-called simplicity often masked blatant inequities. You see, there’s a glaring issue when we let culture justify outdated practices, particularly those that discriminate based on gender. Think about the cousin who justifies asking his sister to serve drinks at a family gathering because “that’s how it’s always been done.” Or the executive who smirks when women at the office can’t get a promotion because the male-dominated higher-ups claim it’s “not our culture” to let women lead. See, the thing is, hiding behind tradition can become an all-too-convenient excuse for some pretty ugly behavior. I’ve heard the argument more times than I can count: “Oh, it’s not that we’re against women having rights, but our culture has a different view of gender roles.” Let’s get one thing straight: It’s 2023, and invoking culture should not be a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a misogynist.

Soon I was dreaming of vacationing in Italy, buying a house and what not. But soon after I started drop shipping, I faced the harsh reality of drop shipping, which made me go “Yep this is not as easy as it seems”. What is Drop Shipping? In recent years, drop shipping has become incredibly popular as a potentially profitable online business concept. The idea is appealing: you can operate your business from anywhere in the globe, there are no upfront expenditures, and you don’t need to invest in inventory. But behind the surface, drop shipping has a number of difficulties that might make it lot more difficult than it first appears. We’ll examine the facts of drop shipping in this post and offer doable tactics for succeeding in this cutthroat market. What I can say with absolute certainty is that it is a prevalent misunderstanding regarding drop shipping is that it’s an assured way to make quick money. In actuality, drop shipping success necessitates meticulous preparation, unwavering work, and a thorough comprehension of your specialized market. During my first Drop shipping business I made only 50$ in sales and spend around 150$ in marketing and other costs. The reason I say that this business model isn’t as easy and straight forward is because of certain reasons. Because there are so many dropshipping stores on the internet, there will probably be tough competition for you. To find a niche with demand and financial potential, in-depth market research is essential. It’s crucial to differentiate yourself with special items, excellent customer service, or focused marketing tactics. Although drop shipping removes the requirement for inventory, your profit margins will be smaller than in traditional retail models. It can be challenging to strike a balance between maintaining profitability and competitive pricing for your items. All expenses, such as those associated with finding products… "

Even though I had put on mascara, I still felt I might be invisible in the group, they are like 3D, but I felt like I was 2D as an Asian.

Sophia Lee was a struggling sophomore, looking for a job that could help pay her way through college. One day, she stumbled across a Pinterest pin that caught her interest. A mother claimed she made $10,000 per month blogging. Sophia had a blog. It was the typical one. Sporadic writings when something happened in her life. Only her family knew of it and visited it. She had no idea you could make money with blogs. But once she got that idea, she went all in. She wanted to make it big with her blog. And her strategy worked. Today, five years later, she’s making $120,000 a month blogging. First, Sophia deleted all her original blog posts. This first year, she focused on fast income. As a student, she had little time to write blog posts. And she needed money, fast. She felt that the easiest way to make fast money with a new blog was with ads. So her goal was to get accepted by an ad agency. She discovered that for that she needed page views. She chose Pinterest for this purpose. After all, that’s how she’d herself discovered that you could make money, blogging. Her second focus was to learn as much about blogging as possible. As fast as possible. That gave her an easy choice. She could figure it out for herself, which would take a couple of years. Or spend $100 on a course and be making money in a couple of months. Take note of one thing here… She did NOT have the mindset of, “Let me take this course and do nothing.” She put what she learned at use immediately. That’s where she behaved in a different way than most people. Determined progress. To earn money for the courses, she took babysitting gigs. And every time she learned something new, she would follow it to a T for two months. After that she would adjust. This is another wise piece of advice. Use it as is for two months, then tweak and adjust. This year, Sophia focused on affiliate marketing, mainly from Amazon Associates. Sophia advised against doing affiliate marketing the first year. Maybe because you need more traffic to make it worth it. Maybe because it takes more time. She didn’t say. When you do affiliate marketing on a blog, it means you need to do SEO. Search Engine Optimization. This was another topic Sophia had to learn. Now she masters it, but she wasn’t born with that skill. Notice how all the way through, she learns and implements. Learns and implements. Then tweak. Sophia didn’t understand the importance of an email list until now. I would switch this to the first year. Unless you really don’t have the energy. An email list will become your most important asset. Sophia said to make sure with everything you posted to be extremely helpful. Keep the reader in mind at all times. Don’t write about yourself. People don’t care about you. They care about themselves. Focus on them. Sophia also started on social media. She chose Instagram and YouTube. Both good places to find traffic. Once again, she focused hard. That meant an Instagram story every day. A YouTube video once a week. All that was extra work, though. Because of all the extra workload, Sophia started to hire. She had to. She hired part-time freelancers to help her with her blogging. Now she had a team. In Year #4, Sophia began to create courses and focused on this part of her business. There is good money in courses. Digital courses. Especially when you have the experience and the knowledge you teach others. She also started a second business. One she’d wanted always. An interior design business. Plus, she began to be more risky in her choices. But she made the money now to be able to be risky. In Year #5, Sophia decided to focus on TikTok. She also started more new business ventures. And she switched from hiring part-time employees to full-time employees. It helped her with her work-flow. Why would she prefer full-time employees? Because, like she said, part-time employees do other things as well. When you have someone full time, they are more focused and more involved with your business. Why not? You now have a 5-year blueprint to follow. You know exactly what worked for Sophia, year by year. And right now, she’s making $120,000 per month. Not too shabby.

My initial belief in my 20s that a great product, a solid team, and a charming personality would guarantee funding quickly dissolved. I tried Kickstarter, started jewelry brands, doing traditional trading on my own. But nothing is as exciting as a high-growth startup. The staistic that only 0.05% of startups seeking investment actually receive it, once you learn about it, is scary none the less. Investors aren’t just looking for creative ideas anymore but are focused more on an elimination method rather than selection. They scrutinize for significant flaws that could lead to a startup’s downfall, a lesson I learned early in my venture with WOLF3. I had become friends with some investors, maybe thats why they will give you more time of the day. During my time developing WOLF3, a Web3 company, I faced the stark realization that many startups fail due to a lack of funds. This understanding prompted me to shift my focus from merely showcasing strengths to proactively addressing and mitigating potential weaknesses. And now with all those lessons, I started a new venture now called Globalify. My experiences taught me the crucial traits necessary to attract the right investors: "

And I was like, let’s try this. That time, I was in 9th class and didn’t even own a mobile. (I watched the video on my mom’s mobile) One good thing was that I started trying things right away. And then there was no tension about what would happen if I didn’t earn money as I had no responsibility at that time. So I tried that method, and it didn’t work for me. The most common problem that beginners face is that there are many fake videos and they start working by watching them as I did. But my journey continued. I kept finding ways to implement it. For some months, It just wasted my time as all the websites on which I was trying to make money were fake and they were just promoted by the YouTubers. I remember one day, I found a website that was giving 25$ for every referral and I was super excited that I could earn from it. It had a withdrawal limit of 160$ so I completed 160$ by making referrals with the help of relative accounts. When I completed 160$, the website expired my login. It was so embarrassing. Then how I made my first money online? Fiverr made this happen for me. As I told you, I was trying every method so I tried the Fiverr freelancing platform, made a gig and I was waiting for my first order. Let me be clear, it took me 6 months to get my first order on Fiverr. And guess what, when I opened my account, it said the order had been canceled as I opened my Fiverr account after a long time. But luckily, the next week, I got an order again. I completed it and finally, I made money online. Isn’t easy? No, It’s not.

They have very different memories from that day. Once upon a time, in the little village of Smallville, there were two really good friends. They knew each other very well, in fact, they were so familiar with each other’s company since they spent so much time together. They were so close, that it was hard to tell them apart, their friendship was really thick. Sure perhaps, it was weird that they happened to be a guy and a girl, but they had been platonic buddies for more than a while now, and it was something that everyone had gotten used to, and the surety of this reality was starting to dawn on everyone. However, there was only one person who could take credit for the friendship being awesome in the duo, which was the girl. In this friendship that seemed to withstand the test of time, at least for now, it seemed pertinent that she was the one with verve and the only one who knew what ‘real friendship’ was about. Yes, and so something finally was going to happen between the two of them; Something that would lead them to either ‘question’ the status quo, or choose to cement their existing strong bond of friendship. Usually, most people who ever walked the earth, or had any kind of bond, or friendship ever, have had to face big decisions like this in their lives, and if they chose well, the wisdom of the bond endured as well. As corny as that sounds, it does happen in real life! And many of us would rather avoid those sorts of moments because the reality of them is too ‘phenomenal’ to understand at that moment. The littlest things are often the most important; And usually turn out to be major events that can even have life-altering proportions. ‘Deep conversations’, sometimes could help to offset things, because of their very deep nature. Especially, when they were by their very nature, just that ‘deep’. Conversations do that people. They do often tend to have that sort of magic about them. So, one day, the two friends, Jill and James happened to be sitting down side-by-side whilst talking about everything they loved. This is something they were accustomed to, and they usually did. A habit for them both, the two talked for hours, getting into deep reflective conversations that made the other think. Or blink. Or change the other. Over Coffee. And all this happened at their favorite haunt, the old Cafe, which happened to be opposite Smallville High. Jill casually happened to remark “Hey, James. We have known each other. a really long while now… December is almost here, do you have a favorite Christmas memory? Being a time to celebrate, many think of it as a time of spiritual renewal. So, do you remember anything significant that we can be innovative about, and use to make this one even better?” James looked her in the eye, and couldn’t help but stifle a laugh. He replied with a smile, “Christmas of 2005 was indeed the most memorable for me at least. It was in a word, different which is why I remember it like it happened yesterday.” “It was the one time when, even though I was still very young, and still in junior high, I remember clearly that there was a lot about me that people didn’t get. A total bookworm, and a guy! At the same time, I had an ardent desire to play basketball for the school team.” “Those days were indeed different, but teaching, very teaching. I hated studying, like many other kids back in the day. There happened to be this one person that I really adored. Who did keep me company as well? A teacher that I simply loved and found relatable. She helped me with schoolwork and encouraged me to join the basketball team, which I later ended up doing.” Upon hearing his truthful admission Jill was filled with a sense of ‘awe, wonder, and self-fulfilment’. She found his story ‘relatable’, and she felt that there might be something that he could learn from her as well to enrich his very personal experience. “To me, Christmas of 2010 was the most noteworthy. To tell the truth, I spent much of it at home, with family and friends. I didn’t hate being social, but I was a Bookworm, like you, being an introvert, is something people usually never get.” “There was this one day when, I happened to meet someone from the other class, without anyone ever knowing. We sat down together in the empty classroom and shared a cupcake together, and that was a really amazing experience. I must admit, because it felt new even though we were both so young! His eyes were blue, and they told a story. The cake had blue frosting. And that’s all I can remember about that beautiful day.” After they had done talking they seemed to look at each other for more than a few seconds and then looked away. The topic was indeed random, but it led to another level of self-discovery for both friends, who seemed to get to know each other better and better as time passed by. Like fine new wine. The truth it brought home, brought a new light to their relationship as well. Suddenly it seemed as if the two friends, had added another dimension of richness to the quality of their friendship, just by having this very conversation. Which seemed in a weird way, like something enviable, precious, and ethereal. “So you were an introvert back in high school too! “ they both said in one voice, in unison. Yet it was strange how it sounded almost melodic! And they looked each other in the eye like when they first started talking. They both were somehow relieved. It was like such a lot of unkempt baggage had been released. It was like their yolk was suddenly easier to bear. It no longer seemed weird that they were playing the staring game in public. Without blinking. Like most introverts. Platonic friends. Who hung out. and overdosed on the good things in life. It was like these two friends were going to have lots more to talk about over coffee, at the quaint little cafe, near Smallville High. Soon it was Christmas, a few months after this particular meeting at their favorite old Cafe. The two friends were surprised by each other, and by now felt more at home with each other safe in the knowledge that they were both introverts. They met as usual that Christmas, but this time it was better than any of their previous meetings! A warm Christmas with hot chocolate and marshmallows. A Christmas like no other. "

Don’t worry; you’re not alone! Bad-smelling boots can be a common issue, but fear not – we’ve got the essential and basic informations on why it happens and some fantastic solutions to kick that embarrassing smell. Wearing boots offers benefits such as improved walking ease, increased speed, and foot protection. They provide comfort and help prevent injuries. However, the issue of unpleasant boot odor can be embarrassing in social settings. Identifying the reasons behind the smell is crucial to finding a solution. It’s simple: boots smell bad when bacteria and fungi decide to throw a party and find favorable conditions, like optimum heat and organic bits. They start the decomposition of organic matter in your footwear. During this decomposition process, organic volatile compounds are produced, which are responsible for the unpleasant smell. The bad smell of boots depends on several factors, as outlined below. Some boot materials, like synthetic fabrics, can trap odors more easily, adding an extra layer to the stench (a distinctive odor that is offensively unpleasant). Apart from that, boots made of animal skin, such as leather, are susceptible to bacterial and fungal decomposition, eventually contributing to a bad smell. Our skin is always shedding tiny bits. If these bits end up in your shoes, they can be decomposed by bacteria and fungi and create a smell. The heat and sweat from your feet are a dinner bell for bacteria, and it’s that bacteria that causes the smell. Heat provides the optimal temperature, while sweat supplies the necessary moisture for bacteria to initiate decomposition. If your shoes get dirty, especially inside, it can lead to a not-so-nice smell. It’s like if you step in… "
https://medium.com/salomon-running/dakota-jones-slowboat-to-advanced-week-180298851482?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"You’d think that looking at nothing but water all the time would get boring, but I look at other things too. I look at my books and my phone and a journal and also this enormous cargo freighter that I’m on, which is unbelievably complex and endlessly fascinating. Actually, I’m not entirely sure if “cargo freighter” is the correct term for this ship. The other passenger onboard — a genial New Zealander who knows a lot about ships and likes to give me unsolicited advice on how things work onboard — told me otherwise within minutes of us meeting. I referred to this boat as a container ship and he immediately launched into, “Oh no, this isn’t a container ship. Those are much bigger. This ship can carry containers, but it does loads of other stuff too, loads.” Incidentally, I spend a lot of time looking at him too, trying to decipher what he’s saying. He speaks so quickly and with such a heavy accent that I only understand about half of what he says. All in all, it’s a bit of a relief to just look out at the water and think. The water exudes a kind of calm power, like a man who knows his strengths but keeps them to himself. It is dark blue-green and heavy looking, as if it’s neither liquid nor solid but some kind of membrane between this world and another dimension. It rolls up and down ceaselessly as far as the eye can see. The waves level out in the far distance so that the horizon is a perfectly flat circle all around us. The surface of the water is forever shifting and changing in a thousand different patterns, but the membrane is almost never punctured naturally. The surface remains taught. This boat, however, is not natural, and it shatters the surface of the ocean like a meteorite hitting the Earth. The engineers who designed this vessel did a good job; with just one propeller, this boat that must surely weigh millions of pounds is propelled forward as ceaselessly as the waves, but more apparently purposefully. We leave behind us a long road of frothy turbulence, marking our path for miles back. “This,” Kerry the New Zealander tells me, “is a working ship, you know. You can’t just [unintelligible] as you please. You have to [unintelligible] before you go roaming about the deck or they’ll [unintelligible] until you don’t know which way is up.” Talking to him is like speaking to someone in a language I’m pretty good at, but don’t quite have the hang of yet. I rely pretty heavily on body language, and while he speaks I submit meek little “wow”s and “oh really”s to sound engaged. Interestingly, I can understand most of the officers and crew better than I can understand Kerry. An interesting fact is that the working language on the boat is English, yet Kerry and I — in other words, the only two people onboard who are of absolutely no help to the functionality of the ship — are the only two people who have English as a first language. The officers all come from eastern Europe. A series of certificates on the wall outside my room tells me that there are two Ukrainians, one Romanian and a Russian guy in charge of the ship’s operations. I had to rely on the certificates to tell me this (and the cook, who is really on my side) because I sure as hell am not about to ask them myself. Perhaps it is a cultural thing to seem surly and serious, but these guys look pissed off all the time. I have received no indication that these men want anything to do with me. They’re perfectly fine with me being here so long as I stay out of the way and don’t talk, but that’s it. I would be perfectly happy to acquiesce…if I didn’t feel it my duty to learn everything there is to know about this boat. As it is, they’re going to have to open up sometime, because I have 12 days to get in their ways until they talk to me. While the officers are a bunch of reticent Europeans, the crew could not be more different. They are all Filipino, quiet, obsequious and kind. They speak varying amounts of English and when they laugh at me I get the sense that it’s good-natured and that they just laugh at everything. I don’t think they get many passengers onboard, so I was a bit of a surprise to them. But they took me in anyway. They wear orange jumpsuits and hard hats and from my perch 7 floors above the main deck I see them going about their inscrutable purposes, climbing ladders, descending ladders, wrenching on things, carrying spools of enormous rope around. I saw a guy walking around with a chainsaw yesterday. We made eye contact and he looked confused at something, but then I smiled and he just smiled back and went on his way. Life aboard ship is simple so long as I can entertain myself. We don’t have wifi or cell service while at sea, so I can’t stress myself out over “work”. I just ride my bike in place and read and write and try to get myself to stretch regularly. There’s a lounge area with some tables and couches and a television that will play DVDs. They gave us three movies to watch: 3 Nicolas Cage movies in Chinese, and what appears to be a Navy Seals recruitment video. That’s ok — I’d prefer to watch the ocean anyway. The water is uniform in every direction , yet never the same twice. It engulfs even this boat that is by far the largest machine I have ever been on. In the distance while at sea are boats even bigger — great container ships with thousands of crates on them. But in the vastness o the ocean even these are swallowed up. They look like bath toys. The surface of the water is impenetrable. It’s hard to imagine that there’s much beneath us. But once I do get my mind wrapped around the incredible depths above which we float, I get nervous and retreat, preferring to see the water as a surface again, rather than a membrane. The 2-dimensional scale of this place is big enough; I’m not ready to comprehend the 3rd dimension just yet. All this in just two days. Ten to go. What will happen next? "
https://medium.com/salomon-running/the-ol-dusty-trail-part-two-7e5cedad3169?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Over the next two weeks I set out to see what could be done on my bike. I have a cyclocross bike, which I soon found out means that a whole lot can be done on my bike. I like to think that my bike is basically a more lightweight version of the first mountain bikes. So in addition to moving fast on pavement, I can also ride on dirt roads, even gravelly and washboarded ones. Even some trails are within my bike’s grasp, as I showed at Montana’s Big Sky resort while covering the Rut 50k with iRunfar.com. To get to my post at the final aid station, from which point I would send out updates on top runners, I needed to be at the top of one of the ski lifts. So I took my fully rigid cross bike up the cat tracks that wound through the ski area. These are bumpy dirt roads that give access to major points on the mountain for snowcats and maintenance vehicles, and my bike handled them just fine. I even outstripped a mountain biker on the descent (although he might have had a flat.) By early September, halfway through the non-running sentence handed down by the doctors, I was really getting into the whole bike thing. So that left only one option. Since with my busted foot I couldn’t run either the Rut or Spain’s killer Ultra Pirineu, nor could I go to Iceland for a Salomon, my schedule was wide open. So I biked home. From Big Sky resort in southern Montana to Durango, in southwestern Colorado. I figured I needed an adventure and I’d always wanted to try bike touring. Plus, the September weather was perfect — warm days, cool nights and far fewer cars on the road now that summer was officially over. I figured I could do it in a week or ten days. Lacking panniers, or even a rack over my rear wheel, I instead tied my sleeping bag under my seat with an old tube and my ¾-length sleeping pad under the frame with my mom’s bootlaces (sorry mom.) I then put everything else that I could think of into this new 22L Salomon pack called the S-Lab Peak Ultra. It’s designed for lightweight backpacking, but wasn’t that basically what I was doing? Lightweight backpacking, but on a bike, and on roads instead of trails. I took with me enough gear to stay alive, though maybe not enough to be comfortable, and in the early afternoon of September 7 I started off down the road from Big Sky, wearing a 15-pound bright blue backpack and a sheepish grin. A cool wind blew down from the north. I finally had a purpose again. Even if my entire direction in life was a physical one, that was good enough after nearly a month of aimless wandering. I set my sights on Durango, 900 miles away by my route, and started pedaling. Having run long-distance races for several years, I was curious to see what, if any, similarities exist between that sport and long-distance bike-riding. Within three days I had pinpointed a few similarities, and some striking differences as well. Long-distance bike riding, like long-distance running, is really a matter of just putting one foot in front of the other. When considered in terms of the entire project (100 miles on foot or 900 miles on bike), the scale is crushing and overwhelming. But when you simply focus on putting one foot in front of the other, all day long, every day, you realize after some time that you’re really making progress, that this goal might actually be possible. When I was in Montana, Colorado seemed more like an abstract concept than a real place. I knew how long it takes to drive between the two places, and that knowledge was combined with this concept I have that you can’t really experience anything or truly feel a place by driving through it. Having driven to Montana and back twice in my life, I nevertheless felt like I knew nothing of the terrain in between my stops. This was a rather negative way to think, and I spent my first night huddled in West Yellowstone contending with a dark lonesome nothingness that pressed in from all sides. Even the second night, 110 miles further on and in the north end of the Wind River mountains, I clutched to my book with the desperate grip of the fearful. I love mountains and open spaces, and I need to be alone often. But I love them when they are a choice, and the first few nights of any expedition can be a struggle to come to terms with that choice. My sense of self radiated outward in the great Western space until it vanished over the horizons. But I still had a direction. Movement is a form of distraction which I embraced early on this trip. In the morning cold of my third day I topped the highest point I would reach in Wyoming — Togwotee Pass in the the Wind River mountains. This was the first landmark to make me think I might be making some real progress. I descended down the other side in a blaze of wonder. The landscape in northern Wyoming is extraordinary. The varied textures of prairie, woodland and alpine coalesce in a unique blend of geography that has set this place apart for centuries. One of the first areas in the West to be explored by white men, and fabulously beautiful though it may be for parts of the year, it nevertheless remains one of the wildest areas in the lower 48 due to a combination of difficulties such as aridity, high winds and extreme winter cold. This is, of course, why I love it so much, and I sang aloud as I descended the pass, knowing that the only people around me for miles were locked up in the infrequent vehicles that passed by in both directions. The first town I reached after the pass was Dubois, Wyoming. I knew the place was small, and when I passed the sign announcing the town I could see only a gas station, tackle shop and an old restaurant. I rode past all this, thinking surely there would be a grocery store or somewhere to get food. But there was nothing. So I turned around, thinking, “well, there sure ain’t much to Dubois….” I went into the gas station and got a pile of food to eat for lunch and to bring with me for the rest of the day. When I stepped up to the register I heard someone say my name. Looking around, I saw that one of the employees knew me. “Hey!” he said brightly. “It’s Chris. I’m Tony Krupicka’s brother in law.” I could hardly believe the coincidence. As I shook his hand I remembered that, yeah, Tony had mentioned his sister and her husband live somewhere in central Wyoming, he’d visited them before. And in fact I had met Chris and Katrina at Leadville in 2012, when Chris ran the race. Turns out, he owns that gas station in Dubois. The coincidence seemed amazing to me, and even more so when I left the gas station and rode past the next hill to find that Dubois is actually a real town with shops and hotels and grocery stores and a high school. If I had known that, I never would have stopped in the gas station. But for whatever reason I did, and there I met a friend on the road. As I passed through town I stopped at Katrina’s coffee shop too (they pretty much have the tourist market cornered in Dubois) to say hi. Then, bolstered by the goodwill of old friends, I rode on into the prairie. That chance meeting was only the beginning of what eventually came to define my bike tour. Now that I’m done I can tally up the miles ridden each day or the style that I camped in or the food I ate or the number of days the whole trip took, but what really stands out are the people I met. Something was different about this bike trip from any other type of travelling I have done in my life. For some reason I was approachable, or interesting, or maybe just a curiosity. But whatever the case, people talked to me. People I had never met before, who I’ll never see again, came up to say hi, to ask questions, to just chat awhile. My most distinct memories of the trip are of those instances when I met someone new. Drinking a root beer in the shade in Muddy Gap, Wyoming, with the open prairie spread out before me, I talked with a guy about my age from Casper (where I was born) who told me that he was working to decontaminate mine waste on rural farms. A 71-year-old man on the Colorado border told me about the fancy bike he got from Germany as he celebrated his birthday by riding from Jackson to Colorado Springs. An art professor in Gunnison told me without ego that just that very morning he had realized he could draw anything he wanted, and do it well, while an 8-year-old boy in Lake City told me about the song the church had sung when his dad died and the way it made his mother cry. Even the clearly-insane homeless man in the mountains above Silverton who ranted at me while I changed a flat about religion, the cops, land-use rights, weapons, prison and The Righteous made me feel good. I find that I get upset sometimes when I think about some of the bad things humans have done collectively, like the way we have degraded the environment or perpetrated wars on ourselves. But on this trip I was struck with the realization that people are unique and opinionated and intelligent and very different when you get to know them on a personal level. For the first time in my life I was able to get to know a lot of these very-different people on a personal level which has largely escaped my orbit until now. It was a surreal experience, to be honest. I felt almost as if I were in a movie. The word “travel” has more than one meaning these days. The straight-up literal meaning is to move from one place to another. “I travelled from Taco Bell to the liquor cabinet,” I might have said a month ago. But “travel” can also have a connotation of something much more than just transportation. Travelling is a concept that has been promoted for centuries as a way of gaining experience in life by seeing other places and cultures, experiencing challenges and fears and stepping outside of one’s comfort zone in the pursuit of personal growth. The idea of travelling is almost synonymous with adventure, and indeed nowadays people feel the need to specify when they’re referring to the second type of travelling by using the phrase “adventure travel.” Someone could “travel” to Des Moines and back for a three-day business trip without really “travelling” at all, in the old romantic sense. But if they were to walk across Mongolia or sail the west coast of Africa, well, that would be pretty adventurous. Even just walking to Des Moines would be an adventure. I guess the difference could come down to the focus on the experience. If you’re just trying to get from one place to another, you’re not “travelling.” But if the whole purpose of the trip is the movement between points A and B, which really sort of stand as arbitrary markers to give the journey starting and ending points, then you would be really travelling in the best sense of the word. Since I was young I have dreamed of travelling. And since I was eighteen I have had some pretty astonishing opportunities to go all over the world for running and climbing. I have been on five continents and in at least twelve foreign countries, meeting hundreds of wonderful people along the way and participating in some pretty wild-ass events. But until I rode my bike from Montana to Colorado, I never felt like I was truly “travelling” in the old authentic style. I struggled to meet people and I spent too much money that ultimately insulated me from the places I was in. But on the bike trip, even though I had the benefit of a bicycle and modern roads, I still felt that I was following in the conceptual wakes of the real legendary travellers, guys like Eric Shipton or Roald Amundsen who used to set out into the true unknown simply for the challenge and adventure. Though the circumstances, means and scale were (vastly) different for my trip than for men like them, the spirit was the same: to choose a place to go and a means of getting there, and to set off with just a minimum of gear and knowledge. What comes of it will come. The rewards of taking an authentic style vindicated the time and the effort required to accomplish the task. I have never felt more inspired to try something new than now. I never finished my bike trip, though. On the penultimate day I blew out the sidewall of my front tire while cruising down a dirt road above Silverton, and the closest bike shop was in Durango. I was forced to cut the trip short and get a ride home. But being curtailed felt symbolic. I wasn’t finished biking on that trip, but even if I had reached Durango I wouldn’t have been finished. I’ll be a long-distance runner for the rest of my life, but I don’t think I’ll ever be finished biking now either. I have a lot more Travelling to do yet. "
https://medium.com/salomon-running/the-ol-dusty-trail-part-one-ddc94ca11869?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"I’m a long-distance runner, which I have to explain in detail to everyone who asks. A lot of people have no conception of long-distance running at all, and even when I tell them what I do they think nothing of it. They can’t conceive of ultramarathons, so they simply don’t. “Oh, Dakota runs a long way.” More often, however, people vastly overestimate what I do. They seem to think that since I “run 100-mile races”, that I do so just about every week or two. They look at me with wide eyes, the way you might look at some bears fighting in your front yard, or as if I come from another planet. No matter that I have run 100 miles just three times in my life and each time only after months of preparation. People blow what they don’t understand out of proportion. I met one of these latter people while visiting the hospital last month. I was at the hospital to finally get an MRI on my left foot, which had been causing me problems for three months. The nurse was a friend of my mom’s, so we knew each other distantly. She was aware that I run long distances. Following the MRI, the doctor looked at the picture or whatever it is that comes from an MRI and informed me that I had two “stress reactions” in my foot and that I should take 4–6 weeks off from running. The nurse then walked me back to the locker to get my shoes and bag, chatting with me as we went along. She was very empathetic to my plight. Indeed, she seemed more put-out by the diagnosis than I was. “Oh this must be just terrible for you. I’m so sorry. Have you ever not run before?” I looked at her. She didn’t seem to be joking. “Well, um, yes, actually,” I replied. “I usually take a few weeks off each year to sort of recover.” “Ok then,” she said, looking somewhat relieved. “But this must still be a real wrench in your plans for the summer.” “Well, yeah, I guess so,” I said. “I’ve been having these problems for a while, so at least now I know what’s going on. And besides, I can still bike and — ” “How did you get out here?” she cut me off, looking suddenly alarmed. “Did you run here?” I looked at her incredulously. “Did I run here? Like, from town?” The hospital is at least ten miles from Durango. “Yes,” she replied simply, looking straight into my eyes. I looked back and realized that she must think I literally run everywhere, that I don’t drive a car but instead run to the grocery store and the library and the trailhead and, apparently, the hospital, even when I’m suffering from a running injury. I shook my head slowly. “No, I, um, drove out here.” “Oh good,” she said, looking relieved again. “You need to take some time off running now, you know.” Long-distance running may be growing in popularity, but it is still a thing of awe and wonder for much of the general population. We’re a distant collection of die-hard adrenaline junkies and endurance freaks to a lot of people who don’t understand what we do. In fact, since a large aspect of the sport is convincing new people to join us (if the magazines are anything to go by), that means a large part of long-distance running is convincing people that we’re not insane or stupid. We define the parameters of what we do by describing our experiences to both runners and new recruits, and the process works the other way too — the act of description helps us describe for ourselves a picture of what we are. We are runners. Long-distance runners. Trail runners. Into these categories we pour our own personalities to create specific niches that define us as people. Through definition we gain a sense of self. So you can maybe imagine why I felt very much unlike myself as I walked away from the hospital that day. For one, the nurse had inadvertantly made me feel like, hell, maybe I should be running everywhere. But once I established that that’s ridiculous, I came to realize that if my entire existence is defined by movement in the mountains, to be stopped is to be stripped of my identity. I was injured, and therefore could not run. And since I could not run, I had nothing to do. All of my upcoming goals were suddenly nullified. I could no longer compete in races or climb mountains or run FKTs or do any of the other things we long-distance runners do. And that’s literally all that I do in my life, which meant that without running/mountain goals, I had no direction. No purpose. I left the hospital in a sort of daze. At first, this was thrilling. I could finally shuck off the weight of responsibility conferred by upcoming races! No longer did I have to focus on being the best athlete possible — I was injured! I immediately drove to Taco Bell and washed it down with Sombra Mezcal. The next day I slept in and then watched a movie before floating down the river. The day following I hardly left the house at all. By the fourth day I truly hated myself. Turning down offers to go running and climbing regularly, I ate poorly and accomplished nothing. What little discipline I had evaporated in less than a week and I sagged into a mindless stupor. With no goals, I had nothing to look forward to. Also, I realized that I might be addicted to exercise, because after four days with no exercise I was as irritable with everyone as if I had just quit smoking. The thrill of freedom quickly mutated into dread for each new pointless day. So I pulled the ol’ bike out. The doctor had said I could still swim and bike. Since I hate going to the public pool and I sure as hell am not about to jump into those icy alpine lakes around here, the bike seemed like my best option. I did a few one- or two-hour rides. Better than nothing, I thought, but I certainly wouldn’t want to do this every day. One day I rode to a nearby reservoir and decided to ride around the lake before returning home. This involved about six miles of dirt road, which I navigated with shuddering arms and gritted teeth. The bumpy surface was difficult to ride and I fretted while descending in soft gravel, fearful that my tires might slide out and send me crashing to the ground with my feet still clipped into the pedals. But when I got back onto the pavement and my heartrate stabilized, I realized that, short and lame though it may have been, the dirt-road section was the most adventure I’d had in over a week. The smooth road felt boring all of a sudden, whereas the gravel had been a challenge with real consequences at stake. And apparently I like working hard and taking risks. A door seemed to open up into a new world of possibility. "
https://medium.com/salomon-running/landie-christiaan-s-transalpine-epic-4a1fd527a4a2?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Part 3: Day 5–8 Day 5 — Landie’s viewSamnaun Vertical Sprint — 6,2km & 731m Ascent Finally feeling like a million bucks, come rain or shine, I was going to have some great fun on my first vertical kilometre (well almost — 730m ascent in 6 kilometres). And would you believe it, we had our first rainy stage. The stage format was structured so that teams of 2 would be set off every 30seconds from 10am onwards. Our scheduled 11h33 start meant a very chilled morning and I thoroughly soaked up the “normal” feeling. Once the gun went, I knew I was back to my old self, and just wanted to run like a horse out of the box. However, with more than 120km of running and big climbs waiting for us in the next 3 days, we took the advice of one of the ladies from the leading women’s team, Helen Bonzor, who also competed in the 2013 Transalpine. She mentioned that there is no point in burning yourself to the maximum, just to gain a minute or two, and in the process compromising the next 3 stages. We still pushed relatively hard and that 2nd spot on the podium was once again ours. This short vertical stage in the rain was rather scenic with waterfalls and cow cheerleaders, and it was fun attempting to pass as many teams as we could on our way to the top! Day 6 — Christiaan’s view 37km Samnaun (Switzerland ) to Scoul (Switzerland) & 2084m ascent As became custom for the Transalps, the start involved a big Alpine ascent, with another big climb waiting for us after the second aid station. But what was different from the first couple of stages, was that all of this started at 1800m, which became quite a challenge for a sea-level organism like myself. Right from the beginning I had difficulty with my breathing and could not consume any solid food, nor could I speak normally any more. This was a very unusual feeling and the only way to communicate with Landie was via hand signals. She helped where she could, carrying my pack, motivating, but the message between my brain and my legs was corrupted by my lungs, who seemed to be rather unhappy with the lack of oxygen. To my relief, the village of Schoul where we finished was at a much lower altitude and we had the best ever hotel to relax and recover until the next stage. Stage 7 — Landie’s view Scoul (Switzerland) to St. Valentine (Italy) 37,8 km & 1633m Ascent What a blessing to once again wake up with excitement in my heart and wonderfully strong legs! It was stage 7, but it was not just another stage. After 6 days, we were about 70 minutes behind the yellow jerseys. We made peace with the fact that unless they experience a serious setback, we will most probably not claim the overall win. However, we were looking for a stage win at least! As a result, we needed to play a different game. After carefully studying the route profile, we noticed that the first 7km was pretty much downhill on jeep-track and we could use our running strength to gain an initial advantage. I told Christiaan: “Run as hard as you can, forget about the yellow jerseys and the other teams and make a gap!” I thought that, even if they caught us on the 1200m climb after that, at least it will mean they would have to exert themselves, or so I hoped… Regrettably, Christiaan still suffered on any form of uphill and I pushed and pulled as much as I could. But as the husband and wife duo of Team Tuga Wear seemed to float past us at the 10km mark, I felt like losing all faith. I pushed those thoughts aside and was desperate to keep fighting. With Christiaan attached to me, there was little chance for sneaky photo opportunities and he had to hang on for dear life, but sadly we lost sight of them soon after. Stage 7 produced some of the most scenic tunnels and thrilling single tracks of the entire run, which certainly helped to keep the spirits and pace up. It was indeed a surprise to catch a glimpse of the leaders as we rounded the corner at the second aid station at 25km. My heart raced and the battle for the stage win was back on!! I instructed Christiaan in Afrikaans to just keep on moving, while I filled water etc. We made sure we kept them in sight on the last 400m climb, with the aim to overtake them somewhere on the last 8km downhill. Team Tuga Wear certainly did not want to give up the stage win, but as the single track opened up into a wider path, we surged passed them and ran to the finish line like we stole something. What a sensational feeling when the commentator announced team Salomon Mixed as the winners of stage7! Emotionally and physically drained after our efforts, I hardly made it to the finisher’s zone. But, nothing seemed to matter, we did it… Stage 8 — Christiaan’s view St. Valentine (Italy) to Sulden (Italy) 40,1km & 1648m Ascent After 28 hours of running over 7 days, I could not help but be happy that this day has arrived! I was so excited to complete the journey and welcomed the initial 17km downhill tar and jeeptrack section. Not even the thought of the 1400m steep climb from the 25km mark couldn’t dampen my excitement. Another bonus for me was that the original route had to be altered due to an incoming snow storm, and instead of climbing all the way to 2800m, we traversed around on the 2100m ridge line of the climb. We learnt by now that our strength compared to the other teams was definitely anything runnable. So when presented with this adjusted route profile, we approached it like a fast road run, completing the first 10km in 41:55. This pace left us with quite a gap on the other teams, but we were aware that this could be narrowed fairly quickly once we reach the very steep parts of the ultimate climb. Thanks to Landie’s continuous motivation and enthusiasm, I used every last bit of energy to bear forward and upwards, without breath and completely exhausted. We caught sight of the yellow jerseys behind us close to the summit, but were determined to consolidate our stage win. We never looked back and negotiated the last undulating muddy kilometres in the rain. I had so many great trail running memories, every time weakness or pain snuck in, I countered it with one of those moments. The race is only finished once you cross that finish line and I was aware of Team Carteney who became injured on stage 7 of Transalpine run 2013 and failed to complete the race. As we ran down the last downhill, past high alpine cottages, fresh water streams, fences, cows, supporters with bells, I became so aware of the blessing of being in the mountains, to run injury free and running towards another stage win with the love of my life.

https://medium.com/salomon-running/landie-christiaan-s-transalpine-epic-f003e924bc2d?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"Part 2: Day 3 & 4 Day 3 — Landie’s view St Anton (Austria) to Landeck (Austria) 39,9 km & 2868m Ascent It was day 3 and after a night of pain, the cramps were still very much with me… I simply could not see myself running with this kind of agony for another stage. Especially these brutal Alpine kind, where, if healthy, is already one beast of a challenge. I mean, 2700m ascent over 40km is no easy task in itself. Now add a throbbing stomach and a European heatwave of 33 degrees C to the mix and this beast turns into an even more unpleasant monster! But, I had a few, actually many, positives going for me; I had the best and strongest team partner who helped me up and over wherever he could; the Lord miraculously empowered my legs to keep going over every rock, kilometre for kilometre; however, most importantly, I still had hope and deep down, I already made the decision that giving up is just not an option. After what felt like days, we fought our way to 2nd place on the podium again, having to outsprint another mixed team in the final two kilometres. Once more, my body felt like it completed it’s last leg, yet the mind were still very much alive and kicking! Day 4 — Christiaan’s view Landeck (Austria) to Samnaum (Switserland) 46,7 km & 2881m Ascent The thought of the longest stage lying ahead of us was quite daunting. But as we came to realize, with our 2015 Transalpine experience, surviving one stage was the only way to go about it. We would study the stage profile in detail the night before to plan our nutrition and strategy. So needless to say, it was somewhat of a shock to discover that not only will the total ascent of the day amount to2861m, but the first climb alone will have an ascent of 1600m, the biggest non-stop climb I have ever been exposed to… I could sense that Landie was back in the game, as she started off really strong on the gradual jeep-track climbs and we were blowing in the necks of the front teams. My strength showed whenever hiking poles could be used and we functioned very well as a team to reach the summit at the first aid station of the day. The yellow jersey’s were still visible in the distance on the alpine ascent, about 3 minutes ahead. We were both hungry to contest and we were ready to make a race of it! But for some reason, this was still not our day, as I learnt that at an altitude of 1800m, I have trouble to breath and eat and I simply struggled to run. It was Landie’s turn to help me and along with the current heatwave in Europe we did the best we could under the circumstances. With Landie’s encouragement as only she can, we managed to secure 2nd place, less than 6 minutes behind the leaders. This stage finished in Samnaun, a lovely little duty- free ski-resort village in Switzerland. The best was that the fact that we were stationed here for two nights, received some royal treatment from South African supporters. However, it also meant that I was exposed to an altitude of 1840m and above for more than 48hours… After every stage, in the evening, a glamourous prize ceremony took place and this specific one was on top of the mountain, with all athletes being transported with the Gondola to the restaurant at the top for a feast of a Pasta Party.

https://medium.com/salomon-running/landie-christiaan-s-transalpine-epic-3e98dfdbe050?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"Mentally and physically drained, struggling to breathe and unable to focus on the digits of my Suunto Ambit, tapping the absolute last bit of energy, we soon hear the very famliar sound of the noon churchbells and the supporters with their cow bells we have become so acquainted with upon entering a village, the cheerful voice of the ever enthusiastic commentator. At last, we have reached the final kilometre of the 2015 Goretex Transalpine run. Controlling our emotions becomes virtually impossible as we make our way into the finish hall in the village of Sulden, with hundreds of supporters roaring us on towards the finish line. Every feeling experienced in the last 192 hours, is relived in this final moment. Day 1 — Landie’s view Oberstdorf (Germany) to Lech (Austria) 34,8 km & 2033m Ascent Our fairy-tale race did not quite start as I imagined. I woke up with severe abdominal pain and most certainly not the “butterfly” kind… Butterflies would have been quite normal, considering that this was after all the biggest challenge of my running career. But I just had this “gut” (no pun intended) feeling that it was more than nerves. Nevertheless, we lined up at the start at Oberstdorf Haus with 700 other enthusiastic and blissfully ignorant runners, including 4 other South African teams. I thought the cramps would ease up with a little warm-up jog, but to no avail. The pain was so intense that I found myself frantically asking for cramp relief tablets at the medical tent 10 minutes before the start. Now my only hope was that the aches would magically disappear once the gun goes… We were set off at 10am sharp and pushed hard in the first 3 kilometres with the lead bunch. Unfortunately, the cramps just seemed to become more intense the further we ran, and I have to admit, I did panic a little inside. We were forced to adjust our game-plan for stage 1 and it was heart-breaking to see 5 mixed teams pass us in the next 5 kilometres. The rest of the stage was merely a fight for survival. But the really gloomy part was that I was unable to enjoy doing what I love so much, unable to enjoy the picturesque alpine scenery and every kilometre turned into a combat of cramps. Fortunately our technical skills came to the rescue in the latter part of the stage and even with my handicap, we managed to pass many of the mixed teams again on the long downhill single track and miraculously finished the stage as the 2nd mixed team, 8 minutes behind the leaders, team Tuga Wear from Spain. Day 2 — Christiaan’s view Lech (Austria) to St Anton (Austria) 24,7km & 1889m Ascent Our splendidly comfortable lodging 500m from the start of the stage in the charming little ski town of Lech set the scene for quite a relaxed morning. Instead, we were rather concerned with Landie’s unchanged health condition and the major climb straight into stage 2! To bring this stage into perspective: We had to climb mountains with just over 1800m ascent, all in the first 17km, making this the hardest 25km we have done to date, with an average incline of approximately 11%. We both used hiking poles during this stage to ease the effort on our legs and once we got the hang of it (there is quite a technique to using them effectively), I especially found the European way of climbing very efficient. We were the first mixed team to reach the foot of the climb after the first couple of road kilometres. But soon, our handicap became reality again as we saw all the top mixed teams pass us as we struggled our way to the top, pushing Landie wherever I can. This was one of the moments in the Transalpine run where I truly doubted in our ability to podium in this event. We eventually did finish 4th in the stage, but I will never forget Landie’s words afterwards: “I think this was my last stage; I have given everything I had…!” Our dreams and goals suddenly seemed so far away!

https://medium.com/salomon-running/anna-frost-s-magical-hardrock-journey-459157a0db80?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"by Robbie Lawless ‘Eyes locked into mine to bring me back from the zombie land, warm soft hands massaged my legs, blankets wrapped around me and Braz repeated to me that the sun was only an hour away…’ It was upon leaving Ouray, a little over half way into her second ever 100 mile race, that Anna Frost’s Hardrock 100 started to go off-the-rails. It wasn’t pain or injury but the heavy weight of sleep — that irresistible, hard-wired need to just curl up and drift off into that beautiful state — that was the culprit. ‘The feeling of being so sleepy was intriguing to me,’ says Frosty. ‘I could barely keep my eyes open and wasn’t thinking clearly or even walking straight — all I could think of was lying down in the grass and sleeping.‘ Up until that point Frosty had seemed like a women possessed. Finally being given the chance to run the race that had consumed her for years, she was embracing the challenge with open arms. ‘It’s a race that captivates certain people. Not everyone will be touched by it, but the people who are are over taken by it,’ says Frosty. ‘It sinks into your bones, your mind runs it over and over and your blood won’t rest until it’s done.’ Up until the halfway point of the race, Frosty’s Hardrock obsession was beginning to resemble a Hardrock procession — she was the leading women, mixing it up with the front runners and seemly marching her way to a first-date winner’s kiss with the famous rock. Two things stood in her way, the fabled Hardrock course itself — considered one of toughest 100 milers on the planet — the other, a seasoned, Hardrock legend. Both were coming out to play — Frosty, as so often before, was going to have to dig deep for this one. ‘I mentally lost it,’ says Frosty of her mid-race meltdown. Battling on through the aid stations at Virginius and then down into Telluride, almost 73 miles into the race, there wasn’t much else for her to do than keep but putting one foot and front of the other while hoping she’d pull through her lethargy. Just as Frosty was having her low point, charging onwards and upwards behind her was none other than Darcy Africa — three times Hard Rock winner. It was on the way out of Telluride, up towards Oscars, that Darcy caught Frosty and took the lead. ‘I didn’t care one bit, I was proud of Darcy,’ says Frosty, remembering the moment of being passed. In fact, it gave Frosty another glimpse of the renowned Hardrock camaraderie. ‘We stopped, hugged and wished each other well. I said I needed to sleep, she said I’d be back.’ And with that she disappeared into the darkness, leaving Frosty in no doubt to their contrasting states of body and mind. ‘I was amazed at how easily she moved through the snow, she didn’t seem cold, I was freezing! I could see the frost building up on everything around me…even my eye lashes.’ As she struggled on to the aid station at Chapman, battling both tiredness and temperatures, icy eyelashes not helping in keeping already heavy eyelids open, the only thought keeping her company, was lying down and sleeping. It turns out it wasn’t rest but redemption she found upon arriving. ‘When I arrived there was my awesome crew and other amazing Durango friends I had met on the road to Hardrock.’ says Frosty about Chapman aid station, 18 miles and two summits away from the Hardrock finish line. It was here, slumped into a chair that she was massaged, molly-coddled and moccafied. The promise of sleep, her beacon through the darkness, snatched away and replaced by the promise of light. ‘I didn’t really understand why Braz had kept saying that the sun was only an hour away,’ says Frosty about her final pacer, Ron Braselton’s mantra. She was about to find out, however. As they headed up the penultimate climb of Grand Swamp, Frosty saw daylight, both literally and figuratively. ‘The dawn brought the singing birds, the light and eventually the sun onto my skin. Then we saw Darcy up ahead and we realised it was now or never.’ Looking back to Frosty’s spring and early summer existence, it’s an achievement in itself that she even got the chance to come to that now-or-never moment. In fact, considering Frosty couldn’t run a step for the majority of that time because of a mysterious hip problem, starting Hardrock was a surprise to many. If the injury-prone early season Frosty was a result of her travel-laden, feverish, euro lifestyle, the one that was about to tackle the last ten, brutal Hardrock miles was 100% made in Colorado. ‘After I left the hectic travel schedule for the San Juan mountains I felt a huge sense of happiness and release,’ she says. ‘I spent the first few weeks in USA walking long and running a little. I believe that often our injuries are caused through mental stress and fatigue and when we can let this go our pains and niggles can also release. Sometimes it’s just a matter of finding what to let go of and how to move on.’ Now, in the final Hardrock act, Frosty found herself with nothing left to let go of. ‘It couldn’t get any worse that it already was could it?’ says Frosty of her reckoning behind trying to chase down Darcy and go for the win, before deciding that, ‘well maybe yes, but it was worth a try. So we went, and we didn’t stop — not even in the last two miles.’ She had survived the longest, darkest night of running and tapped into that indomitable spirit that has sculpted her career. She’d done it. She’d gone and won Hardrock. ‘When the finish arrived…I was in shock, in denial, I couldn’t believe we were there,’ she says remembering the moment. ‘Kissing the rock still seems like a crazy dream that took so long but came so quick. For me this is so much more than a race…it is a family, a community, a history, a magical journey!’ Though it’s Frosty’s name that will be woven into the intricate fabric of Hardrock’s folklore, she’s quick to point of that there’s a whole world of support that played it’s part. ‘Without the love and support and belief from so many people around the world I don’t think I could have dug deep, I don’t know if I could have found those legs,’ she says, before adding. ‘Running is not an individual sport…it is all of us together…believing we can do it and then it is just up to us to piece the puzzle together.‘ "
https://medium.com/salomon-running/lnside-kilian-s-classik-dbec2a619e61?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"by Martina Valmassoi It’s quite bizarre how I switched from being a shop assistant to sharing a ride with a legend of ultra running, an institution of trail running and a rising star of Skyrunning. It’s so fast, in fact, that it’s difficult for me to even grasp. The guys I’m in the car with, the guys I’m talking about, are Ellie Greenwood, Greg Vollet and Remi Bonnet. I’m Martina Valmassoi — completely, or at least almost completely, unknown in the trailrunning world. Perhaps a little bit more renowned in Italy — mainly because of my exploits in Skimo. You could say that I’m associated more with activities when the mercury starts to drop and the snow starts to fall. We all arrived in Font Romeu, in the French Pyrenees, together, to take part in Kilian’s Classik. You can easily guess where the event’s name came from, if you can’t, you’re probably reading this article my mistake! Font Romeu is just surreal. At first sight it looks like a simple tiny village in the mountains with not much to offer, except for the epic mountains ripe for exploration. Delve a little deeper, though, and you realise you’re in a microcosm — a small universe made for superhumans. It’s an Olympic Centre where athletes from all over the world come to train to beat their own records. For others it’s a place to study how to do it while attending the famous sports college. You see, it’s not an ordinary place — but the world is full of extraordinary places so why does Kilian’s Classik happen here, in Font Romeu? Well, it’s here that Kilian himself studied, it’s here where a young Mr Jornet lived for a few years and it’s here where his dreams were born and nurtured. We stayed at a place called called Huttopia. When you see it for the first time you can sense the adventure and excitement of the place — it’s not a location for boredom or stress. You see, Huttopia is not an ordinary hotel but a cute village of small wooden houses and white tents that immediately reminds you of your childhood. Before dinner we catch up to discuss the week’s program. We introduce ourselves not by results or titles, but with humility and a passion for running. What you feel at the end of the evening is that we we’re not here to race and train, it’s better than that! The first ruleis not to forget the main values of Kilian’s Classik: exploration, adventure, sharing, pleasure, socialising. The adventure started from the first night. From the highest ridge of Carlit to the deep blue of the ice lake. From the bright green of the forest to the flat path at 2000 meters where there are more cows than flowers. We explore, we share, we run together from one summit to another. Sometimes people tire and find it difficult to keep up, then the group stops, naturally, waiting, resting before running on together again. The last two days of races are best described as a celebration. Normal runners alongside the elites — taking photos together, sharing part of the trail. Kids waiting for hours with their hands up just to high-five someone in the race. The long line of people waiting for us to sign a picture or a t-shirt. This kind of connection from one athlete to another or even the connection to the community, it’s something that you can’t teach, like nobody can teach you how to love the mountains or the trails. Here at Kilian’s Classik that connection was everywhere. Maybe it’s in the air or the altitude, but I guess that all the people grew up here knowing these values extremely well. "

The actual updates to the law were published in February 2021, so potential applicants had time to adjust. You may not like the new rules, but at least now they are official. Let’s take a look at what has changed and what you should do about it. If you want to qualify for the Portuguese Golden Visa through direct residential real estate investment, you can no longer invest in the two largest cities of Portugal, nor along large parts of the coast of the mainland. That includes the large parts of the Algarve, the “silver coast”, Sintra, and so on. From January 1, 2022, you can only make qualifying investments in the interior of mainland Portugal (the approved municipalities and parishes are listed on pages 2–4 in this document — concelho means municipality and freguesia means parish), as well as in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores. There may be some changes to this based on litigation, but to be on the safe side, it’s better to assume that this list is correct. The law specifically only refers to real estate meant for housing (“habitação”), which means that investments in commercial real estate — such as hotels and pre-approved tourist apartments (alojamento local) — are still allowed in these regions in 2022 and beyond. Portugal already applied a distinction to the Golden Visa program where investments in low-density areas got a 20% “discount” compared… "
https://medium.com/nomad-gate/the-perpetual-traveler-6a160c35bdde?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"This article, like much of what I write, does not apply to American and Eritrean citizens. In this particular case, it is because these jurisdictions are unique in that they (may) tax non-resident citizens, according to a 2011 report by E&Y. This is a subject that is as popular as it is broad. It is unlikely that I will manage to cover everything here. This article will just be an introduction to the concept. Tax residence is the jurisdiction — or jurisdictions — in which you owe tax on a particular source of income. For the vast majority of people in the world, this is simply the jurisdiction in which they live. The conditions under which tax residency is determined varies between jurisdictions. As a general rule, if you are resident in a country for more than 183 days in a year, you are tax resident there. However, there are plenty of jurisdictions with shorter residence or other requirements to become a taxable person there. I am not going to dig deeply into specific jurisdictions in this article, but for a quick overview of what the definitions of tax residency for personal income tax are, refer to the Deloitte’s tax guides. In the Highlights documents, look under Personal Taxation and Basis and Residence. On my glossary page, I have written the following definition of a Permanent Traveler: “A natural person who does not reside in any jurisdiction for a long enough period to be deemed tax resident, thus avoiding tax liability.” As the name implies, a permanent traveler (PT for short) is someone who travels, permanently — or at least permanently enough so that they are not tax resident anywhere, or only in jurisdictions that lack income tax or only tax local income. A typical PT runs a location-independent business or has income from investments. They will travel from one country to the next, often using just tourist visas or, in the case of EU nationals and comparable international agreements, traveling across country borders completely unhindered. While being a permanent traveler in and of itself is legal, most PTs technically break laws. They break laws by working in a country whilst on a tourist visa and or by failing to file tax return (even if they owe zero tax) for these activities. Virtually zero PTs end up facing consequences and there are no real efforts being made to go after them. A PT is not a migrant workers with no papers; it’s someone with every intent to move on. For example, suppose that a PT arrives on a sunny island somewhere and has a citizenship that gives them 90 days visa free. During those 90 days, the PT works on their (often internet-based) business from a hotel or AirBNB apartment wifi. They then leave the sunny island not to return again, at least not until after 366 days since last arrival. In many cases, the PT was not allowed to conduct business whilst on a tourist visa. This typically includes businesses that aren’t even operating or trading in the jurisdiction. Now, you may think — but I visited a sunny island on a tourist visa recently and answered a couple of emails from my phone whilst on the beach. Am I going to jail? No, you’re not. The primary purpose of your stay was tourism and you entered the jurisdiction with the intention to be a tourist. You may have to explain yourself to your spouse who’s upset because you spent all day at the hotel answering emails, but that’s a completely different topic. But a PT who enters a country with intent to work is in many cases technically violating the law. Second, even if you are a non-resident (for tax purposes), any income earned from work that took place in a jurisdiction should generally be submitted on a tax return. Failing to do so may be a crime. However, chances are no one is going to go after you for failing to submit a tax return that states you owe no tax. This is one of the most common questions about being a PT. Although I realize not everyone is well versed in how the international financial services sector works, I continue to be surprised when people ask why a bank insists on clients providing a residence address when opening an account. For various reasons, mainly related to tax and prevention of money laundering and other financial crimes, banks need to know where you live. You still need an address. If you cannot provide an address, do not expect any bank to take you on as a client. Here we enter unchartered territories because the words mean different things in different contexts and across different languages. Greatly simplified: Residence is where you live. Domicile is where you belong. In the absence of a true residence, a domicile is sought. This can be the country where the PT spends most of their time, even if they don’t qualify as resident there, or a country to which they have the strongest ties. For some, this ends up being their country of citizenship. Others seek to establish a domicile in a tax-favourable jurisdiction. In many cases, a domicile is set up by obtaining a permanent residence visa with minimal requirements on physical presence, such as Panama, UAE, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Cyprus, Malta, and a handful other jurisdictions. A permanent residence permit is obtained and an address is established, either by the PT renting an apartment, buying property as an investment, sharing a residence, or using a law or accounting firm’s office or other property. This address can then be used for opening bank accounts, form companies, and so on. A PT with correctly structured finances pays zero or extremely little tax. They may break laws but doing so at essentially zero risk, provided no abusive activities take place. Costs, however, can be significant. Aside from costs related to travel and temporary accomodation, the costs of private health insurance (PTs rarely qualify for universal healthcare anywhere, except possibly country of citizenship), foreign currency exchange related costs, and the cost of a domicile quickly ramp up.

Yet, you can save thousands every year by choosing the right bank. If you travel abroad for a week or two per year, 3–5% in various fees and bad exchange rates for international card use is not really a big problem. But as a frequent traveler or digital nomad spending most of your time abroad, these fees add up quickly. In fact, you might be donating hundreds or even thousands of dollars yearly to your bank. I’m sure you could think of a better way to spend that money. But what if I told you that there are banks out there that charge no monthly fees, 0% foreign transaction fees, 0% currency exchange markup, 0% ATM withdrawal fees and even refund fees imposed by ATM owners worldwide?

Don’t worry if you haven’t-you’ll find everything you need to know about it in our Estonian e-Residency guide. In short, it gives you a digital identity and access to lots of Estonian government services, including founding and running a company. Currently, every one in six new companies registered in Estonia has been founded by e-residents. But let’s take a step back-why would you want a company in Estonia in the first place. “It’s the country next to Russia, right? Or was it Russian that people speak there…? And the capital is Riga, isn’t it?” These are the questions I normally get about Estonia. Let’s set the record straight-the capital is Tallinn and Estonians speak Estonian (which is similar to Finnish and nothing like Russian). And yes, it is situated right next to Russia (along with 13 other countries). Estonia is still somewhat of a well-kept secret, but having a company based there is a huge advantage as 99% of government services are digital. This means you can get by without unwanted travel, long queues, and menial paperwork. For example, you can incorporate a business in just a couple of hours entirely online. The Estonian business environment is very transparent and thriving, boasting the most unicorns per capita worldwide. It also has the world’s best tax system (ranked number 1 seven years in a row). One unique feature is that Estonian companies aren’t required to pay corporate income or capital gains tax if the revenue stays within the company. That means you will be able to reinvest it into your business (or financial markets, real estate, etc.) with your pretax money. This will also allow you to take full advantage of compound interest-often called the 8th world wonder-when building a nest egg for your retirement. For ideas, how to do that, check out our retirement savings and investment guide.

https://medium.com/tk-running/portugal-golden-visa-guide-updated-52cb90699447?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"The Portuguese Golden Visa program is one of the most popular both in Europe and the world, and for good reasons: As far as Golden Visa programs go, the Portuguese program is also relatively accessible. These being the best options for most people: Unfortunately, the information you find when searching about the Portuguese Golden Visa is often unreliable, biased, or out-of-date. That’s why, when writing this extensive handbook about the Portuguese Golden Visa, I enlisted the help of Alexander Dumont dos Santos -an independent lawyer with several years of experience assisting clients with their Golden Visa applications. I’ve also met with dozens of professionals, including fund managers, real estate developers, lawyers, and immigration consultants-all in an effort to identify the best available paths to Portugal’s Golden Visa, and keeping this article up-to-date. That being said, I want to make clear that I’m neither a lawyer nor a financial advisor, and no information in this article is to be taken as legal or financial advice. Do your own due diligence before taking any action. Also, by signing up for certain services through links or introduction forms in this article you help support my work as I’ll get a small referral fee. In any case, I will only recommend products that I believe are the best fit for my readers. Read more about this policy here. With this lengthy intro out of the way, let’s get started! Established in 2012, Portugal’s Golden Residence Permit Program (ARI) enables non-EU/EEA citizens to obtain a special residence permit in exchange for a 5-year investment in Portugal. What’s unique about the permit is that the investor only has to spend about seven days per year in Portugal to maintain the residency, while still reaping all the benefits of being an EU resident-including visa-free travel in the entire Schengen area. While the program has benefited more than 6,500 foreign investors so far, it has also been beneficial for the Portuguese economy. As of this writing, the total investment into Portugal as a direct result of the program has reached a whopping €4,851,321,701. That’s almost five billion euros. That’s great news for prospective investors, as the program has broad support from nearly all political parties in Portugal. While a conservative government introduced the program in 2012, the current socialist coalition government has even expanded the program since seizing power at the end of 2015. Any third-country national-meaning anyone except Portuguese and EU/EFTA citizens-can apply for the Golden Visa after completing a suitable investment into Portugal. The investment can be made as an individual or through a legal entity meeting certain requirements. You will also need to meet the (minimal) physical presence requirements mentioned below. Your investment needs to meet at least one of the following requirements: For more details about the requirements, click here. The Portuguese parliament passed an official update to the law on February 12, 2021 regarding the Golden Visa program. The changes will take effect on January 1, 2022. The most important change is that from 2022, Golden Visa eligibility won’t apply to residential real estate investments made in metropolitan and coastal areas including Lisbon, Porto, and most of the Algarve. In addition to this, the minimum investment for capital transfer will increase from €1 million to €1.5 million, and the fund investment minimum will increase from €350,000 to €500,000. Capital transfer for R&D and company incorporation won’t be affected by the changes. The full details can be found in our post about what’s changing in 2022. Government representatives have said that they don’t wish for this to impact any ongoing investments. If you are in the process of investing in the coastal and metropolitan areas, don’t worry, there is still time. The official cut-off date is December 31, 2021. By this date, you must have submitted your Golden Visa application. This means that you have until December to make investments on the current terms, finalize them, and apply for the Golden Visa. If you are already in the process, I’d recommend being on the safe side and finalizing your investment as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you are still thinking about starting the Golden Visa process, I’d say it’s still okay to start making an investment, although you should hurry. For the investment fund route, you should probably aim to have everything finalized by September just to be on the safe side. If you are unsure if you will be able to complete everything in time, it’s probably best to consider making an investment with a company like Mercan, who will buy back your investment in case your application is denied. The initial application is now submitted online, including copies of the supporting documentation. After the request is approved by Serviço de Fronteiras e Estrangeiros (SEF), you will have to appear in person for an interview. Initially, the interview would take place in the district where the investment was made. Nowadays, however, SEF will allow you to book the interview in any district of your choice. This change has helped reduce the waiting time overall, especially in the more popular districts such as Lisbon and Faro. Usually, you complete the application through your lawyer, and it can take up to 6 months for approval. It is technically possible to do everything on your own, but I wouldn’t recommend it. If you want to bring along your family members, their application is submitted simultaneously. A processing fee of €532.70 is paid for the first applicant and €83.10 for each of the remaining family members. When your application is approved you pay an approval fee of €5,274.40 for each applicant. After ten to twenty days, you should receive your residency card valid for two years. Year 1–2 Your residence card will allow you to travel freely within the Schengen countries (you also need to bring your passport), without applying for any visas. In the first two years, you must spend at least a total of fourteen days in Portugal. To renew your residence permit and receive a new residence card, you need to go through a renewal application process between 30–90 days before your current residence card expires. During the renewal process, you have to retake biometrics (fingerprints, etc.), provide up-to-date criminal records, and pay a fee of €2,637.20 for each applicant. Additionally, the processing fee is again €532.70 for the first applicant, and €83.10 for other applicants (family members). Year 3–4 Your new residence card is valid for two years. (There have been discussions to extend this to three years, but this may or may not pass.) During this period you need to be in Portugal for at least another total of 14 days (consecutive or non-consecutive). At the end of the period, you’ll go through another renewal process-unless the validity of the second residency permit has been extended to three years by the time you receive it. Year 5+ After the fifth year, you can apply for permanent residency or citizenship (you can choose which one). If you don’t want to apply for either, you can continue renewing your Golden Visa every two years (at the end of year 6, year 8, and so on). While the process isn’t very complicated, it does involve gathering a lot of documentation-both in Portugal and in your country of origin. It will be beneficial to work with a native Portuguese speaker if you don’t already know the language. The steps for the initial application look something like this: All of these steps can be completed remotely (with the help of a lawyer), except for the biometrics appointment-you will have to travel to Portugal for that. Let’s take a closer look at some of the steps. I won’t go into details on the process in this article since I already explained it in great detail in two other articles ( how to get a NIF and how to open a bank account in Portugal as a non-resident). The reason why you need those things is that you need a Portuguese bank’s confirmation that you have transferred the funds and made your investment. You need a Portuguese fiscal number (NIF) to open the bank account. It’s not a complicated process and can be done in less than a day. To get a NIF as someone without a fixed legal address in the EU/EEA, you will need a Portuguese representative for the tax authorities. This can be your lawyer. Your lawyer can also help you apply for a NIF remotely, and there are also some banks that allow remote account opening. So far I’ve glossed over the fact that to make a suitable investment, you also need to find one. While initially nearly all Golden Visa investors chose to invest in real estate, that is gradually changing as more investment options have been made available (such as investment funds). Another option that can be interesting for an entrepreneurial person is the creation of 10 jobs in Portugal. This route has no fixed minimum investment amount. An art investment is the most affordable option, and while potentially lucrative it remains somewhat unproven. Do let me know, however, if this is something you’re considering or want to learn more about. If you have been following my writing for a while you know that I am a big proponent of utilizing (primarily index) funds for growing your wealth over time. While the investment funds available for Golden Visa applicants have more traditional cost and management fee structures than passive index funds, I still think it’s the best route to the Portuguese Golden Visa for most people. Since 2018, the option to invest in a fund that meets certain qualifications has gained popularity. Since then the minimum investment amount has been set to €350,000. Although, note: it will increase at the start of 2022 I personally believe that this option is much better than the (up until now more popular) real estate option for most people interested in the Golden Visa. It has several advantages: A five-year GV investment in real estate at the €350,000 level (which is practically impossible to find in prime locations anymore) realistically would cost about €460,000 including taxes, fees, transfer costs, furniture investments, lawyer fees, etc. Buying into an investment fund at the same €350,000 level would likely only cost a bit over €380,000-the bulk of the €30,000 “markup” being made up of the actual Golden Visa fees themselves. While the real estate market in Portugal (especially central locations in Greater Lisbon and Porto) is starting to mature and is looking less and less like a good deal, with an investment fund you can get exposure to completely different industries or just a less saturated part of the real estate market (e.g. retail, commercial and industrial rather than short-term holiday homes)-making it at least just as likely of having a good return than buying real estate directly. The list of funds that are available changes over time (as subscription periods close and new funds are introduced). Annoyingly there’s no official list of funds that qualify, however, I have taken it upon myself to do the research needed to create such a list. To do so I reached out to the managers of every single fund that’s regulated by CMVM (the Portuguese regulator), and met in person with dozens of them to learn which funds are available to Golden Visa investors, now and in the future. In general, we can place the funds into one of three main categories: Due to Portuguese regulations, I’m not able to include a lot of details of the individual funds directly in the article, so if one or more funds sound interesting just click the learn more link next to it to get an introduction to someone who’s authorized to provide all the details you need (including fund prospectus and more). Currently available funds As mentioned, the list of qualifying funds open for investment varies constantly. You’ll find the currently open funds below: There are now too many funds to include all of them in the article, but you’ll find the full list here: I’m always on the lookout for other funds to include, so if you find any promising ones, please let me know and I will investigate them. NOTE: Unfortunately, US citizens and residentsare not able to invest in all funds (due to FATCA complications). I have clearly marked the funds that are available to US citizens and residents here. A real estate investment might also make sense. Particularly if you plan to buy a property where you intend to live yourself or if you prefer the tangible nature of a property investment. Buying property in Portugal is open to anyone, with no restrictions on your nationality or residency. You’ll still need to get your Portuguese tax number first. There are a few different “levels” of property investments available to you, depending on factors such as location and project type: Due to the upcoming changes, the closer we get to the end of 2021, the more cautious you should be about making residential property investments in the affected areas. I’d especially be careful with the €280,000 and €350,000 levels as these typically take longer for approvals and get all the paperwork sorted. Keep in mind that you’ll need to submit your complete Golden Visa application by the December 31, 2021 deadline-and ideally well before this to be on the safe side. If you want to make investments at these levels before then, I’d seriously consider doing so into either commercial real estate or directly with a developer who would agree to refund your investment in case you’re denied the Golden Visa (e.g. see Mercan below). To get a sense of the market, you can always start out looking at the websites of real estate brokers ( agências imobiliárias), such as: Keep in mind that in Portugal, brokers usually work for the seller. While you don’t pay them a fee directly (it’s covered by the seller and based on sales price), they are incentivized to sell properties for as much as possible. You can also take a look at aggregator websites. In many cases, they can put you in touch with the sellers directly. Here are some examples: Just be aware that many listings you’ll find on these sites are no longer available, even though they’re still listed. Generally, the properties worth buying move very fast. Still, these sites can be useful for getting a general sense of what’s available in the market and at approximately what price. Since typical Golden Visa investors aren’t experts on the Portuguese real estate market themselves and usually don’t know all the laws, regulations, or even the language, most decide to either: Both paths come with their own benefits and potential pitfalls, so let’s take a closer look at each. There are quite a lot of real estate developers targeting Golden Visa investors, and to be honest, most of them are probably not worth your time. It’s not uncommon to see properties marked up significantly compared to what they would fetch in the local market. This is especially the case for €280,000 level properties, and to a certain extent with €350,000 level properties. But it may happen at any level. But that doesn’t mean there are no good options in this category, particularly if your aim is capital preservation and a smooth Golden Visa process, and not necessarily maximizing your return. In particular, there are some developers that offer “guaranteed buybacks” when you’ve completed the 5-year Golden Visa process (and sometimes also fixed annual income) that may be worth considering. To be clear, I’d be cautious with most of these buyback schemes, too. After all, the guarantees are only as strong as the companies backing them. In many cases, developers will set up a dedicated company for each development (often referred to as a single purpose vehicle or just SPV for short), and ideally the buyback should be offered by their main Portuguese corporation, not this SPV. Either way, you should have your lawyers check the solidity of the company offering the guarantee. Another thing to look for in projects offering these kinds of guarantees is whether they are using any leverage in the development. If they use a lot of leverage (bank loans) to finance the developments, you’ll have increased risk that the developer or the SPV defaults before it comes time to execute the buyback. Or even if there’s no default, having no leverage means the developer has an easy way out of a cash flow crunch if more investors ask for a buyback at the same time than they had budgeted for-they can simply get a bank loan with the real estate development as collateral. The final thing to consider is the track record and reputation of the developer. Do they have a history of delivering value to investors in Portugal or perhaps even internationally? Do they have a good reputation which they are incentivized to protect? Both will make it easier to trust a developer to execute well and take good care of their investors. As I mentioned earlier in the article, due to the upcoming changes to the Golden Visa program, you may find it beneficial to make a real estate investment with a developer offering a buyback not only at the end of the process but also in case your Golden Visa application is denied. Mercan is one of very few real estate developers we’ve found that checks all the boxes I outlined above. If you are someone who first and foremost wants… …then you should take a closer look at their offering. Mercan is a Canadian company with more than 30 years experience in the migration and property development industries, with a long history with both the Canadian and U.S. immigration by investment programs. They were also the first developer to offer a project qualifying for the €350,000 level in Portugal, and to date have about 50% of this market segment. They currently have hotel investments available in Lisbon and Algarve, one at €350,000 and the other at €280,000 level. They’ll cover the purchase taxes for you, and offer to buy back your units once you’ve received your permanent residency or citizenship. The one in Lisbon will also be paying 3% fixed annual income. Since these are commercial properties, they will not be affected by the 2022 Golden Visa changes. But even if you were to be rejected for the Golden Visa, Mercan would buy back the property. When making an investment with Mercan, they and their partner law firm will take care of the entire process for you: From applying for a tax number, opening bank accounts, submitting your application, and accompanying you to your SEF biometrics appointments, they take care of everything. Temporary offer: If you contact Mercan through the link above now you get a 33.33% discount on their partner’s legal fees.

If you’re looking for newly built properties from reputable Portuguese developers who don’t specifically target Golden Visa investors, I’d recommend taking a look at the buyer’s agents below. You’ll likely come out way ahead with their help compared to going it alone. If you’re looking to buy a regular property for either your family or for investment purposes, I highly recommend hiring your own independent broker or buyer’s agent. Having someone working for you-someone who usually doesn’t get a cut of the sales price and only has your best interests in mind-that’s one of the best investments you can make. While it will often cost you some euros on top of the purchase price, you are likely to save much more by finding a better property at a better price.

Also read: How to Find Portugal’s Best Real Estate Deals While starting and running a company in Portugal for 5 years doesn’t seem like an easy route to get the Golden Visa-it has the benefit of not imposing a minimum investment amount, meaning you may get away with a smaller upfront investment than the other options. This option has been available since the beginning of the Golden Visa program but has understandably not been as popular as investing in real estate or an investment fund. After all, the whole point of the Golden Visa is to get residency and eventually citizenship in Portugal without having to spend a lot of time in the country to manage your investment. For some time there was a company who offered this option as a service (at a total upfront investment of €125,000-split between service fee and capital contribution), where they would set up and run a simple company on your behalf. Unfortunately, after COVID-19 happened they no longer offer this option. Of course, if you are a business owner or entrepreneur in your home country, and need to build out a European operation (e.g. customer support, tech team, etc), you may want to consider basing it in Portugal so you can qualify for the Golden Visa that way. Here are the things you always need to gather for your application: Again, all documentation (unless otherwise noted) needs to be issued within 90 days before the date you submit your online application. Anything issued by a foreign entity has to be legalized (e.g., with an apostille if your country of origin has signed the Hague convention). Moreover, anything that’s not in Portuguese needs to be translated and certified. For anything you need to collect in/from Portugal, your lawyer can help you out a lot, including the documentation relating to your investment. What type of additional documentation you will need depends on your chosen form of investment. Click each investment type for more information: The easiest and safest option is to let your lawyer handle and guide you through the application process. However, if you insist on doing it yourself, these are the steps: In short, you can: The Schengen countries include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The EU members Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania, are all required to join the Schengen area in the future, but as a Portuguese resident, you can already travel there visa-free. The benefit of the Golden Visa is that you can get Portuguese permanent residency or citizenship without having to live in the country most of the year. It’s as if your investment is spending the time in Portugal instead of you for 5 years. It is also the only option if you are not ready to move to Portugal yet, but want to start the clock so to speak towards permanent residency or citizenship. On the other hand, if you are ready to move and want to spend the next five years in Portugal, then alternative ways might be cheaper (but not necessarily simpler). Take a look at our comparison of the D7 and Golden Visa for more details. As of 2019, you pay a €532.70 processing fee when submitting your application (plus €83.10 for each additional family member), followed by €5324.60 per person for the initial issuance of the Golden Visa. The two renewals (at the end of year 2 and 4) are charged at €2666.30 each, per person. You also pay the €532.70 processing fee when submitting each renewal (plus €83.10 per dependant). These rates increase very slightly every year to keep up with inflation. In addition, comes the cost of hiring lawyers, as well as any costs of legalizing and translating the supporting documentation. Exactly which funds are available varies over time. You can find all active funds on the website of the regulator, however, most of these are not open for subscriptions or do not meet the requirements. I already know of several funds that qualify, which you can learn more about here. However-I am in the process of mapping all the funds that are both available to GV investors and are open for subscriptions at the moment. I’ve reached out to all the regulated funds in Portugal and are meeting with several during January and February 2020 to work out which ones are available. I should have updates to share by mid-February 2020. If you leave your email in this form and select that you want to hear about funds launching in the future, I will let you know once I have the results from my research. To my knowledge no one has done it yet, however, it should be possible. It is certainly much more straightforward to invest the whole €350,000 in a single fund, which will ease SEF’s efforts to frame it within Golden Visa rules. If you want to go for several funds, it’s a good idea to ask your lawyer first to get a confirmation from SEF stating that it is acceptable. In that case, you would have to move your investment into another fund under the same Golden Visa category. Yes, in addition to making your investment as an individual, you can make the investment through a legal entity, e.g., an investment or holding company. It is essential that you are the only owner or member of the company, and that it is based in either Portugal or another EU member state. It varies over time. It used to be around five months but COVID-19 has impacted the waiting times significantly. At the moment, you should allow around 6–12 months for the process. The application itself is submitted online, but you need to travel to Portugal for biometrics after your application is accepted. Currently, it is not possible to do biometrics in an embassy or a consulate. First time for biometrics about 6–12 months after submitting your initial application. It depends on how long your application is processed and on the waiting times for the appointment. After doing biometrics and getting your first residency card, you will need to spend 14 days in Portugal during the next two years. You will then need to have another appointment for biometrics for the renewal of residency cards. After receiving your second residency card, you will have to spend again on average 7 days per year in Portugal. Currently, it takes at least several months to get a biometrics appointment after SEF application approval. If you haven’t started your application yet, there is a good chance the travel restrictions will be lifted by then. If you need to travel to Portugal soon for biometrics, you can come from EU countries, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Due to the low cases count, also people from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Canada, South Korea, the USA, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro, New Zealand, Qatar, North Macedonia, Moldova, mainland China, Serbia, Singapore, Ukraine, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan can enter. The list is correct at the time of writing, however, it changes continuously. For the latest information, please check the SEF website. For other countries, you can contact your lawyer or SEF to issue a letter for essential travel. In this case, you also need to have proof of a negative test result performed within 72 hours prior to departure, without which you cannot board. If you are a legal resident, you can travel to Portugal freely from any country, although you may still need to show proof of a negative PCR test. Only time spent in Portugal after getting your first residency card counts. Therefore, the first biometrics visit is not included in the 14 days you need to spend in Portugal during the first 2 years. However, the time spent in Portugal during the second biometrics visit for the renewal of your residency card counts towards the 14 days required for the first 2 years. I would definitely recommend that you do. You’re making a sizable investment to gain Portuguese residency (and eventually citizenship), so I wouldn’t recommend taking any chances during the application process. While the lawyer fees aren’t insignificant, they are much cheaper than making some formal error, making a bad investment, or one that ends up not qualifying. Many law firms charge upwards of €4,000-€6,000 for the primary applicant. There are also cheaper options, but it’s worth asking if certification of documents, translations into Portuguese, and/or tax representation is included. The application for dependents is cheaper and averages often between €1,000-€2,500. The renewals of Golden Visa for the main applicant (at the end of year 2 and 4) average around €2,000-€2,500. Expect to pay up to €20,000-€30,000 in lawyer fees for a family of four (for the initial application and the two renewals) when hiring one of the more expensive firms. If you need help finding experienced and well-priced Portuguese lawyers, here we have compiled a list of the most popular legal service providers among Nomad Gate readers. While this might be a leading question, the answer is definitely YES! Some firms are taking advantage of Golden Visa applicants by offering investment options (typically in real estate) that both look nice on paper and meet the minimum investment amounts. What they fail to mention, however, is that they are selling it far above the current market value. It’s not uncommon to see firms offering properties to Golden Visa applicants for the convenient sum of €500,000 that in reality is barely worth €400,000-€450,000. That’s how these firms might offer you a great “deal” on their legal or advisory fees. However, in reality, you’re paying much more than you would if you sourced the investment independently and used an independent law firm for your application process. You should also consider hiring an independent buyer’s agent to make sure you make the best possible real estate investment. You’ll find several experienced buyer’s agents here. Yes, you can! You can bring your spouse, as well as your kids (as long as they are younger than 18 at the time of application, or enrolled in studies and being supported by you). In certain circumstances, you can even bring your parents and/or in-laws, as long as you can demonstrate that you are supporting them. Any dependents need to meet the same criteria on each renewal application, not just on the initial application. Yes, anything that’s not in Portuguese needs to be certifiably translated (in addition to being legalized). Not even documents issued in English are accepted. It can be a good idea to do this in your country of origin, but it’s also possible to get it done in Portugal. Legal residency and tax residency are independent concepts, and you don’t necessarily become a Portuguese tax resident by utilizing the Golden Visa. Even if you don’t become a full tax resident in Portugal, you will probably have to pay tax related to your investment in Portugal. In either case, becoming a tax resident in Portugal can be quite lucrative, especially for the first ten years thanks to the Non-Habitual Resident tax scheme. According to PwC, you will become tax resident in Portugal if you fulfill either of these conditions: No, it is not required. Although, if you don’t, you have to cover many health care costs yourself. In that case, it might be prudent to get private health insurance instead. Due to a change in the Portuguese Nationality law in 2018, the required period of residency before you can apply for Portuguese citizenship has been reduced from six years to five years. While the application for citizenship may take a while, once granted the application for a Portuguese passport generally only takes about six working days. Per 2018, an ordinary passport costs €65 and is valid for five years. Yes, currently that is a requirement (though there are ongoing discussions about removing it). You’ll need to pass a test at the A2 level (the second-lowest level), so it’s not very hard to pass. There are plenty of good ways of learning online, and I’d recommend spending your required time in Portugal practicing further. You can take the language test at any time before you apply for the citizenship or permanent residency. A potentially useful tip is to take the language test abroad (not in Portugal) as those tests seem to be graded more favorably. If you prefer a more structured approach to study, Portuguese Connection Language School has offered classes for foreigners since 2015 online and offline. They have both private and group lessons. They are the only private school whose A2 level test is valid for PR, and they also offer preparation for A2 level citizenship exam (CIPLE). If this is the case, it’s okay as the gap won’t have any impact on your legal residency. In fact, the required term necessary for citizenship or permanent residency starts from the date that you were first issued a visa. Any residency gaps will only impact your ability to travel within the Schengen Zone. From time to time Nomad Gate will host webinars together with partners. You can access recordings from previous webinars, plus be notified of new ones. If you still have some questions about the article or the Golden Visa, feel free to post them below.

But since it’s easy to be overwhelmed at all the offers popping up in your inbox and social media feeds, I figured we could all share the best deals we’ve come across, with a special focus on the needs of digital nomads, PTs, remote workers and other location-independent people. I’ll make sure this posts is updated with the deals you share below. NordVPN: Get 3 years for $2.99/month. Definitely the best deal you can expect from them during the year. It has grown to become my personal favorite VPN service, as it hits that oh so sweet combination of performance and affordability — especially at this price. ProtonMail + ProtonVPN: Get two years for the price of one, on either ProtonMail Plus, or ProtonMail Plus & ProtonVPN. ProtonMail is great, and their VPN is improving too, so if you interested in using your own domain with your ProtonMail account, don’t miss out on this offer. ExpressVPN: Get an additional 3 months for free when you sign up for a year. While it’s not the craziest Black Friday deal out there, it is the best performing VPN I’ve used (and I’ve used lots). TorGuard: Get a 50% lifetime discount on their already affordable VPN plans. Use the coupon CYBERWEEK50. TorGuard is perhaps not as good as NordVPN and ExpressVPN — especially their apps and connection speeds leaves a bit to be desired. However, at this price it’s an excellent choice for anyone who wants a decent VPN service at a bargain price without committing for a long time ($30 for a year, $50 for two years).

https://medium.com/tk-running/how-to-open-an-n26-bank-account-from-anywhere-38aa1308dac9?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"N26 has long been my favorite bank in Europe, and for good reason. Their user friendly app, low fees, useful integrations — like Transferwise — and their investment module puts them miles ahead of most of the competition. The fact that you don’t have to show up in a physical branch anywhere makes it an even sweeter deal — especially for the nomadic crowd. I’ve written extensively in the past on why I love N26 so much, so if you’re still not sold check out this article. In short, all you need to do is to: The process is quite quick and easy, but if you’re unsure about anything, keep on reading for all the details you might possibly need… Anyone can open a N26 Bank account, as long as they are resident in the EU or EEA. In order to open an account, you need a mailing address in one of the countries where N26 operates for them to send you your Mastercard. As of this writing, N26 operates in all the Eurozone countries, except Malta and Cyprus. That leaves Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Slovakia, Greece, France, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Slovenia. They will also start offering local accounts in the United Kingdom in late 2018 and the United States in 2019. You also need a smartphone running iOS 9 or Android 5 or higher. Opening an account in N26 bank is easily done in three steps: 1. Filling out the online registration form 2. Completing an ID verification, 3. Pairing a smartphone with your account The first and thirds steps are the same for everyone, but the second step varies depending on your nationality and residency. We’ll get back to that in a minute. No matter your residency and nationality, you start by filling out the N26 registration form. Just go here and click the Start registration button. If you happen to be traveling outside of your country of residency (especially if outside of the EU/EEA) I’d recommend using a VPN server in your home country while registering. The country you sign up with will determine the features and pricing for your N26 account “forever”, even if you move to another EU country at a later date. You will be asked to enter your: Next, you’ll be asked for “the serious legal stuff” (standard AML — anti money laundering — questions), which includes your: Finally you have to agree to their terms and conditions, and optionally opt in to product updates and some privacy settings. After you have confirmed your email, you can log in to your account and choose which N26 plan you want. Which plans you can choose from depends on in which country your delivery address is. The new Metal card is only available in Germany, France, Italy or Austria for now, the other plans are available everywhere: If you’re unsure, just go with the regular N26 plan for now. You can always upgrade later. NOTE: If you select the Business plan you can not change to a personal plan later, so for most people I would not recommend it! The next step is confirming your identity. Whether you can do this through a selfie or video call in the N26 app in a matter of minutes, or if you have to visit a German post office, depends on your nationality, ID documents, and delivery address of your card. Assuming you don’t have a German address, the ID verification is super simple: You just need to take a selfie and a photo of your ID document with the N26 app. These are the ID documents for various nationalities that are supported through the N26 app: There are exceptions where an older passport, even from the mentioned countries, is not supported. That might be the case if it lacks biometric safety features — something most modern passports have. If you don’t hold any of the passports or ID cards listed above, your only option is to open an account with a German address and go to a German post office. After you have verified your email address, download the N26 app to your phone and log in. Make sure the lighting conditions are good so the pictures are clear. Make sure you have your passport or ID card (according to the list above) and follow the instructions in the app. It shouldn’t take more than a minute! N26’s German partner for identity verification via video calls, IDnow, currently supports the following passports and ID cards: Again, there are exceptions where an older passports without biometric features are unsupported. If you don’t hold any of the passports or ID cards listed above, don’t worry. Just skip ahead to the section about the PostIdent method. After you have completed the initial registration form, you’ll be instructed to download the Android or iOS app to complete the identity verification. Make sure you have your: Once you initiate the call, you will usually be connected to an agent without much delay. On some occasions you might have to wait a little bit, but rarely more than 5–10 minutes. Note that you can only do the video verification between 8 am and midnight German time. During the call you will be asked to verify a few details from your registration form, as well as typing in a code sent to the phone number you registered with. You will also be asked to show your ID document to the camera in different angles so that the agent can verify that it’s legit. If you’re interested, here’s a video made by the IDnow team that explains the call in a bit more detail: Note that the call will take place within the N26 app, not the separate IDnow app mentioned in the video — but it still follows the same format. If your delivery address is in Germany and you don’t have one of the ID documents listed above, your only remaining ID verification option is the PostIdent method. It is really only practical if you’re living in Germany or are planning to visit. To be honest, visiting a city like Berlin for a while is not such a bad thing, anyway. At least in the spring or summer. It’s one of the most creative cities in Europe, and still relatively affordable. And I’m sure other parts of Germany is worth visiting as well. Oktoberfest, anyone? Anyway, once you do find yourself in Germany, this is how you verify your identity: Citizens of the following countries should use the PostIdent method: The final step to activating your account is to pair your smartphone. Just download the N26 app and log in (if you haven’t already). Since your account isn’t yet paired with a phone, you will be guided through the steps when you open the app. Make sure the number you entered during the activation is correct and click confirm. You then receive a four digit verification code via SMS and enter it in the app. If you need to change the number you registered with, just contact N26 support and they will help you out. Once you have paired your smartphone, you can use it to verify transactions such as SEPA transfers, Moneybeam, activating your Mastercard or Maestro card, and a few other things. That’s it! Look out for your shiny new N26 Mastercard in the mail! So what are you waiting for? Open your N26 account right now — you won’t regret it! Originally published at nomadgate.com on July 23, 2018.

https://medium.com/tk-running/what-to-think-about-the-new-n26-bank-37b93dbc1327?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"After operating using the Wirecard platform for a couple years, N26 (or Number26, as they used to be called) finally got their own banking license in Germany. And being a fully licensed bank, they can provide services they couldn’t before. While they only had one main plan to choose from before, now there’s three. When you move your N26 account from Wirecard to N26 Bank (or sign up for a new account), you have to choose which one you want. So that begs the question… There are three options: The first is the same N26 account you know and love. It’s the same fantastic app, largely the same pricing, etc. I encourage you to read the full price list to compare the accounts for yourself, but here are the most important differences: The only other change is that ATM withdrawals made with your Maestro card now incur a 2 EUR charge (for all three plans), while there’s still no charge if you use your MasterCard. Otherwise, their new plans still keep what made N26 so great in the first place, such as no exchange rate markups for purchases, probably the best banking app in the world (I’ve used plenty), and so on. Overall I think N26 is moving in an interesting direction. I won’t go into too much detail about their new plans in this article, but I’ll post a more thorough update soon. Yet, here are my initial thoughts: If you just keep the regular N26 account, this is a slight downgrade from what you had before. If you’re not looking for travel insurance or a better way of keeping track of your business expenses, the only immediate changes are the 2 EUR charge on ATM withdrawals using your Maestro card and the 1.7% fee on withdrawals in other currencies.

You’d probably be pissed and never reread any of my articles. Don’t leave. I’m not here to tell you it’s easy. But I’m here to shed some light on some things and, of course, the latest research in this endless debate. Before we dive into things, can we all agree that it’s annoying that influencers can’t seem to get along? Fitness and nutrition influencers are constantly arguing on social media about the best way to burn fat. There is never one silver-bullet approach, which makes it confusing for everyone. We’re all left trying to figure out what the hell works. One on hand, you’ve got fitness gurus telling you that high-intensity interval training is the way to burn off that excess fat. While nutrition influencers are trying to convince you to restrict your calories. While both make sense in theory, which is best for you? Making matters worst, we’re living in this infodemic.

I recently noticed this occurring a lot more lately. Is it the pandemic blues? Why do some cyclists get angry when people run in the recreational lane? Are they misinformed? Do they think it’s solely a bike lane? It’s not just a bike lane, it’s a shared recreational lane. I think there is a big difference here.

https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/regular-exercise-can-protect-you-against-harmful-covid-19-outcomes-7284d97600a?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"Is there a convincing case for a protective effect of physical activity against harmful COVID-19 outcomes? The international study, recently published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examined objectively measured physical activity data involving 65 361 adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis from South Africa between 19 March 2020 to 30 June 2021. Researchers found that regular exercise is protective against adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Participating for more than 150 minutes per week was seen to be most beneficial against poor COVID-19 outcomes. A high level of activity was associated with a 34% lower rate of hospital admission, 41% lower rate of ICU admission, 45% lower risk for the need of ventilation, 42% lower risk of death due to COVID-19 than people who engaged in low physical activity (<60 minutes). Similar benefits were seen for people who were also moderately active (i.e., 60–149min per week). Protective effects were found among people with common comorbidities, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney failure. Indeed, these diagnoses may increase a person’s risk of poor outcomes; participating in high levels of regular exercise may be even more beneficial than seen in healthy individuals. Some may wonder why exercise is protective against harmful COVID-19 outcomes, and that’s okay. Regular exercise is known to reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system by releasing tiny destroyer cells (lymphocytes), and may enhance your body’s surveillance system to identify viral invasion. These crucial findings reinforce the need for all adults to try and meet current exercise guidelines, which recommend 150 minutes per week of exercise. Even participating below the generally recommended levels could have substantial benefits against the harmful outcomes of COVID-19.

We hustle for health, savour nutritious bites, and cozy up to sound sleep. And now, in a breakthrough that seems ripped from the pages of a sci-fi novel, researchers from high impact universities are giving us a glimmer of a possible future where age isn’t an enemy. This is epic news, people. Harvard and MIT. Two weeks ago. Aging can be reversed in animal cells. Say what now? Link for the full-text article here. Billionaire biotech CEO and investor @friedberg thinks it’s massive. According to him, it’s “the most important trajectory of what’s underway since the discovery of DNA”. Whoa, that’s big.

Researchers have been trying to hit the Yamanaka Factors sweet spot — enough to bring back the youth but not too much to start a cellular rebellion. This approach has been used in reversing vision loss, making retinal cells feel like teenagers again. "

Science begs to differ. Recent revelations propose that significant gains are achievable with strength training just twice a week. I resonate with the hard gainers, because I was one. There was a time when my life revolved around the gym, spending hours in lifting weights, cardio, and squeezing in as much as I could. However, the exhaustion outweighed the results. A comprehensive scientific review of almost 200 studies, involving over 8,000 participants, suggests that twice-weekly resistance exercise provides nearly the same muscle growth and strength benefits as more frequent, intensive workouts. These findings contest the popular belief that substantial gains demand a high-frequency training routine. Published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, this meta-analysis aimed to uncover the optimal strength training regimen for maximum benefits in muscle strength and hypertrophy/size. "

Let’s make no mistake here: this is not just a harmless excuse, it’s an insidious mindset, an invitation to future ill-health. The reality that is often overlooked is those who persistently claim they can’t find time for fitness will inevitably have to accommodate illness. This wake-up call isn’t designed to be a fearmonger but to highlight the priceless resource we possess: our bodies. Amid job-related stress, social commitments, and pressing issues, our well-being frequently gets sidelined. Regrettably, the disregard for physical activity can have serious health consequences. We dwell in a world where burning the midnight oil is applauded, and carving out time for a park run is perceived as indulgence. This skewed viewpoint is nothing short of evading our obligation to our health. Physical fitness isn’t merely an optional pastime; it’s a mandatory safeguard and investment to prevent future health troubles. Consider this. Every time you declare you’re too busy to exercise, you’re essentially trading your health. Each missed workout session is a lost opportunity to fortify your body against possible health hazards. You are choosing instant pleasure over lasting health benefits. But what’s the real cost? Disease is a product of long-term unhealthy habits. "

I had been training for months for this moment, and I was finally here. I ate a light breakfast and put on my new pair of shoes. They felt amazing. They were so light and responsive, and they made me feel like I could run forever. I walked to the starting line, surrounded by thousands of other runners. I took a deep breath and tried to stay calm. The gun went off, and we were off. The first few miles were a blur. I was running faster than I ever had before, and I felt great. The shoes were working their magic. I was passing people left and right, and I was on pace to beat my goal time. As the miles went by, the pain started to set in. My legs were burning, and my lungs were aching. But I kept pushing forward. I knew that I could do this. The crowd was cheering me on, and I could hear them chanting my name. It gave me the extra boost I needed to keep going. The final miles were the hardest. I was exhausted, but I refused to give up. I kept my eyes on the finish line, and I knew that I was almost there. Finally, I crossed the finish line. I had done it! I had run a marathon! I was so happy and proud of myself. I took off my shoes and looked at them. They were covered in mud and sweat, but I didn’t care. These super shoes helped me achieve my goal, and I would never forget them. As I walked away from the finish line, I thought about how different my race would have been without them. I would have been slower, and I might not have even finished. But the shoes had given me the extra boost I needed to succeed. I was grateful for the shoes, and I knew that I would use them again in the future. But I also knew that I couldn’t rely on them too much. I still had to put in the hard work and train properly. They were a great tool, but they weren’t a magic bullet. I still had to earn my success.

Glass Productions was, of course, founded by six-time Emmy award-winning journalist and television personality Nancy Glass. Glass Entertainment Group (GEG) is a full-service production company specializing in unscripted television, film production, new media content and podcasting, with over 4,000 hours of programming. When she was just two years old, her baby brother tragically died. He was only four months old. Tracyraquel grew up believing that her baby brother’s death was the result of a terrible accident. Her family refused to discuss what happened, leaving her suspicious and wanting answers. Years later, Tracyraquel discovered that her brother’s death was no accident. Medical records revealed that she was responsible for Matthew’s death. But she was only a young toddler at the time. Could it be true? Or was she simply a scapegoat? Tracyraquel knew in her gut something more sinister was at play. The series explores Tracyraquel’s pursuit of truth, justice, and healing. Last year, Glass faced criticism — as the last journalist to interview infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer — for “romanticizing” his horrific acts. Glass joined “America’s Newsroom” last year to discuss the criticism surrounding the 2022 Netflix series, “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” and her sit-down interview with the convicted serial killer in 1993. “I know that it may seem bizarre, but I think it’s more about morbid curiosity than romanticism,” she said on the news show in 2022. I think this true-crime show will be interesting just to hear Nancy Glass use her overheated rhetoric and make that face she does like a skunk just died in the road outside her home.

Record sales lived and died on their reviews, and music fans flocked to music magazines such as Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and, of course, Rolling Stone, to read these music journalists. Today, music journalists are not as widely known, and record sales do not hinge on their reviews, yet they are still relevant as they interpret music for us and attach cultural significance to the music we hear. One of the best music journalists writing today is a Vermont native, Ray Padgett. He is the author of Cover Me: The Stories Behind the Greatest Cover Songs of All Time (2017) and, in the 33 1/3 series, I’m Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen (2020). He writes the Substack newsletter Flagging Down the Double E’s, about Bob Dylan in concert, and is the founder of the cover-songs blog Cover Me. His writing has appeared in The New Yorker, SPIN, Vice, and MOJO. In short, Padgett has what it takes to write about music in its multiple forms. In his latest book, Pledging My Time: Conversations with Bob Dylan Band Members, he collects 40 original, in-depth interviews from the perspective of the musicians standing a few feet away from him on stage — from his earliest days in the ’60s all the way through the 21st century Never Ending Tour. The book is significant because the world of Dylan’s bands and his road life has seemed fairly obtuse for decades now. Many people in this book have never spoken before about their time with Dylan, or certainly not in as much depth. Interviewees span every era of Dylan’s career, from Ramblin’ Jack Elliott and Martin Carthy talking about the early folk scene up through Benmont Tench and Alan Pasqua talking about recording Rough and Rowdy Ways. This guest list guiding the backstage tour also includes one-off sit-ins, behind- the-scenes touring personnel, and even a notable Grammy Awards stage-crasher. Padgett is the ideal interviewer — he really knows his stuff, so he can draw the best out of every musician he talks to.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads.

But, according to researchers from Cornell University, the now once-thought as highly secure solution hides a troublesome truth that could cause huge privacy concerns. Also, this discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today. If there’s a ubiquitous element in today’s frontier AI, that is embeddings.

At first glance, they may not seem like much. Reading OpenAI’s announcements, it’s easy to get bogged down in the nerdy specificity of some of these new additions. But make no mistake; as technical as they may seem, OpenAI’s new announcements have the potential to change the world just as much as ChatGPT did around this time last year. Here’s the core of what OpenAI announced, and why it matters. One of OpenAI’s most exciting announcements was the availability of the GPT-4 Vision platform through their API. Previously, OpenAI had released the Vision platform only via their ChatGPT interface. Vision is super powerful, but was somewhat limited — in order to use it, you needed to log into ChatGPT and upload your images manually, a few at a time. Adding Vision to OpenAI’s API is a game changer. It means that instead of having to use a manual process, developers can now build vision capabilities directly into their own applications. A screen-reader company, for example, could build the system into their software, allowing visually impaired readers to have a description of any image on the internet instantly created and read aloud as they surf. I tested this new capability myself and it’s pretty remarkable. Media companies like my company, Gado Images, can use the Vision platform to understand the visual contents of our databases of tens of thousands, or even millions, of images. That capability makes it way easier to locate valuable parts of a collection. "

The result is often a camera that delivers incremental improvements over its predecessor, offering more megapixels or perhaps the ability to automatically focus on the eyes of the Short-beaked Echidna while ignoring the Numbat standing next to it, which is sure to be an indispensable feature on your next trip to Australia. But now and then, someone unveils a camera that makes photographers sit up and take notice. Fujifilm did it with their first X-T, X-Pro, and X100 series cameras, which delivered on both form and function. Olympus did it with their digital PEN-F, a tiny work of art combining unique features with a refined industrial design. Not coincidentally, these cameras featured a retro aesthetic that resonated with many photographers who had come to appreciate the pleasing design and functional advantages of the best 35mm film cameras. In 2013, Nikon gave retro a whirl with the somewhat polarizing Df, a camera that puzzled some and delighted others and has since become a bit of a cult classic among its fans. In 2021, they gave us the Zfc, an APS-C camera that delivered on the looks but lacked the premium feel buyers wanted. And then, in September 2023, Nikon revealed the Zf, a camera that has enjoyed an overwhelmingly positive initial response from reviewers and photographers alike. There is no shortage of information on (or opinions of) this camera, so my goal here is to share a few things that either came as a surprise to me when I picked up my Zf from my local camera store or I feel haven’t been sufficiently addressed and, therefore, might come as a surprise to someone using this camera for the first time. Perhaps this shouldn’t have come as a surprise, as the dimensions and weight of the Zf have been published for some time, and many reviewers have made this point. Still, the retro design and the smallish Nikon Z 28mm and 40mm lenses that pair up so well with this camera led me to believe the Zf would be smaller than it actually is. I don’t see this as a bad thing, just one that caught me off guard, which brings me to my next observation. The first thing you notice when you pick up a Zf is the weight. It is heavier than I expected and has a substantial “carved-from-a-single-piece-of-something” feel that is very hard to describe until you hold one. There is density here. It says, “I’m built to last.” The top plate dials are brass and operate with feedback and precision that suggests some genuine mechanical goodness is hidden beneath them. If how a camera and its controls feel is important to you, the Zf should be a real treat. And, though it looks plenty handsome in the photos I’ve seen, it is even nicer firsthand, where it’s easy to appreciate the thought and detail Nikon put into this camera. Some will argue that looks are superficial and don’t matter, but I disagree; seeing this camera on my desk, even as I write this, makes me want to pick it up and head out to make pictures. I have always been pleased with just how easy it is to work with Nikon’s NEF (RAW) files and equally impressed by the quality (and workability) of their out-of-camera JPGs. I find Nikon’s JPGs and colors among the best of any camera brand, so my expectations were high. What I wasn’t prepared for was just how good the images from the Zf are, particularly in low-light situations. I’m used to this sensor from the Nikon Z6 and have always been pleased with it, but Nikon has sprinkled some magic fairy dust into the Expeed 7 processor, and the resulting images are exceptional. I realize how a camera feels in hand is highly subjective. I don’t have big hands, and I have the beginnings of arthritis, which complicates matters a bit. The deep grips on my Nikon Z6, Olympus OM-1, and Fujifilm X-S10 make them very easy to carry one-handed. When I had a Fujifilm X-E4, which entirely lacked a front grip, I had no issues carrying it all day long, but that was a much smaller and lighter camera than the Zf. The Zf has a small, molded grip on the front and nothing beyond a textured surface on the back, which I find uncomfortable and provides no feeling of having it securely in hand. I didn’t need to take it out shooting to realize that I wanted the SmallRig grip, which I ordered immediately. Do I wish Nikon had made the grip bigger? Actually, no. I grumbled a bit at first, thinking it was a mistake to let function follow form, then realized the design as-is works for many users, and offering the optional grip broadens the Zf’s appeal without compromising its aesthetics. This wasn’t a surprise for me, but only because I owned a Nikon Df and was forced to get my head around this concept back then. For anyone who has not used a Df (or a Zfc), this, more than any other aspect of the Zf, can lead to frustration and disappointment unless you take time to understand how they work and adjust your expectations accordingly. On Fujifilm bodies that lack a PASM mode dial, the exposure triangle — aperture, shutter speed, and ISO — is controlled by dedicated dials, including an aperture ring on most Fujinon lenses. Set them all to “A,” and you’re in program mode. Move the aperture ring away from “A,” and you’re shooting in aperture priority. Leave the aperture ring on “A” and move the shutter speed dial, and now you’re in shutter priority mode. Move the ISO dial away from “A,” and you’re instantly out of auto ISO and able to specify a value. When none of the dials are set to “A,” you’re in full manual mode. Not so with the Zf, which has a PASM dial for choosing between program, aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual mode. Shooting in full manual mode or shutter priority mode poses no issues. When using the shutter speed dial, remember that you are limited to making full stop exposure adjustments unless you set it to “1/3” stop, at which point the dial itself no longer controls shutter speed. It isn’t until you choose program or aperture priority mode — or you want to use auto ISO — that things begin to unravel a bit. The problem starts with the aperture ring, specifically the lack of one. Unless you are shooting with older Nikon glass, such as one of the AI, AI-S, AF-D lenses, or certain third-party or adapted lenses, there is no aperture ring, so the front or rear command dial must handle that function. I don’t consider this a big deal, but it is one of the reasons that prevents Nikon from taking the same approach as Fujifilm. Choosing aperture priority mode means the camera will determine a corresponding shutter speed to ensure proper exposure, effectively taking the shutter speed dial out of the equation. Functionally, that’s easy enough to understand. But because a physical dial not only serves as a control (allowing you to choose a value) but also as an indicator (which displays a value), the shutter speed dial — which lacks an “A” position to remove it from the manual exposure equation — now shows a value that is irrelevant and incorrect. The ISO dial situation is even more nuanced. If you want to use the dial to set your ISO and you’ve disabled auto ISO in the menus, it works exactly as you would expect. If you place the ISO dial in the “C” position, it switches to the value set in the ISO menu so long as auto ISO is disabled, much like every other camera. If you enable auto ISO, settings in its menu allow you to specify a maximum ISO value and a minimum shutter speed, which, when reached, triggers the camera to raise the ISO value to render a correct exposure. This, too, is precisely how auto ISO works in almost every other camera, including Nikon’s other Z bodies. But what about the dial when auto ISO is enabled? It can still be set to any ISO value, but the auto ISO algorithm overrides that setting. Much like the shutter speed dial, it looks to be a relevant control but isn’t, and the value it displays is wrong. When using auto ISO, there is a way to make the ISO dial function as a high ISO limit control. However, it isn’t explained well in the camera’s user manual, and the dial still does not indicate the actual ISO value being used. Nikon could have gotten around this by adding an “A” position to the ISO dial but didn’t, which I regard as a pretty significant oversight. They could also have provided the option to use the “C” position to enable auto ISO, and still could with a firmware update, I suspect. There is no way to toggle auto ISO on or off with a single step. There are a couple of ways to get to the auto ISO menu without a full dive through the menus, but neither is ideal. Is this truly problematic? It could be if you’re trying to apply Fujifilm logic to the Zf. If you accept that the Zf uses similar dials but a different paradigm and don’t try to make the Fujifilm square peg fit into the Nikon round hole, then no, it really isn’t. My advice: Accept the Nikon for the unique camera that it is, and don’t let the fact that it marches to its own drum in some ways tarnish your experience with it. I have a confession: I have a burning dislike for touchscreens. I love my iPhone, but if I could get one with the physical keyboard from my Blackberry Curve from twenty years ago, I would buy it (said the old man shouting at clouds). It’s not the touchscreen’s fault; people use them all day long with great success. But, for whatever reason, my fingers never land on the right button, key, or icon. Even with auto-correct, my text messages sometimes look like they’ve been written in a completely different language. I’m also lousy with the various swipe gestures of the iPhone. When I want notifications, I get the control panel. When I want the control panel, I get the search page. You get the picture. With the Zf, Nikon has done away with the joystick, a navigational feature most manufacturers added when they abandoned the trusty D-pad. Depending upon the situation, I typically focus and re-compose, but when focus is supercritical (think close-ups or very shallow depth-of-field situations), I move the focus point around instead. Thus, I was very concerned when I learned I might have to rely on the touchscreen for that function. My other cameras also have touch screens, and I couldn’t disable them fast enough. As it turns out, this is one of my favorite Zf features. It is way faster and far more precise than fiddling with a joystick, and I have no problem getting it to respond how I want it to. As a bonus, Nikon lets you adjust which part of the screen gets used for this purpose. I have mine set up to use the upper right section in landscape orientation and the upper left portion in portrait (vertical) orientation, as that’s where my right thumb naturally fell. Brilliant! Many photographers — me included — find great pleasure in adapting older lenses to modern bodies. No, they’re not always as sharp as modern native lenses, and most lack autofocus, but vintage glass, such as the Nikkor manual focus AI and AI-S lenses, are a joy to use. They are mechanical wonders, and their optical formulas and coatings deliver a certain character and vibe that’s been dialed out of today’s offerings. Nikon knew people would want to mount those lenses up on their Zfs, and they paid particular attention to making sure using them was a positive experience. Focus peaking and the resulting pseudo-depth-of-field preview is especially good on the Zf. As a bonus, if you have eye detect AF enabled, and the camera spots an eyeball in the frame, it points out as the preferred focus point, allowing you to zoom in and nail focus quickly. Because of the Z system’s short flange distance, adding an adapter — including Nikon’s own FTZ or FTZ II models — does add some length to any non-native glass, turning lenses like the tiny Nikkor 28mm f/2.8 AI-S I use into a combo that’s nearly the length of the Z 50mm f/1.8, and there’s no way around physics. Still, being able to use those great old lenses with such ease is a real treat. This one isn’t as much a functional or hands-on surprise as a commentary on Nikon’s decision to combine a traditional film camera aesthetic and analog controls with incredible performance. Mind you, I’m not complaining; I think Nikon is to be applauded. It should help keep the internet wags quiet, as one of the criticisms of the Df was that it borrowed things like its autofocus system from the more modest D610 rather than the D750. I never thought the D610 or the Df — both of which I owned and enjoyed — were under-performing cameras in any way, but some critics took issue with the “parts bin” approach in the Df, which was not an inexpensive camera compared to the D610 or D750. They certainly can’t say that about the Zf. To make an automotive analogy, the Zf is reminiscent of what is commonly known as a “sleeper,” much like the 1966 Plymouth Fury my aunt drove when I was a kid. From the outside, it looked like a standard-issue government car, complete with dog dish hubcaps and bereft of any chrome or comfort options. But under the hood lurked a 440 cubic inch V8 that would leave shocked muscle car drivers in the dust at traffic lights and caused the magnetic St. Christopher on the (all metal!) dashboard to cover his eyes. The genius here is that buyers who want a very handsome-looking camera that nails the retro vibe can get it and not concern themselves with using all of the Zf’s features and capabilities. Meanwhile, those looking for a camera with 90% of the Z8’s specs and features can get it for half the cost with the Zf. In his novella, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, author Robert Louis Stevenson portrays Jekyll and Hyde as two distinct people. One is good, the other evil. There is no gray area, and the two never manifest at the same time. While the Zf has a bit of a split personality, the fact that they peacefully and successfully co-exist broadens the appeal of this camera and will undoubtedly contribute to its success. When I bought my Nikon Df several years ago, the aesthetics drew me in. The Df was — and is — a beautiful camera to my eye. As someone who had been shooting Fujifilm cameras for several years, the thought of owning a retro-styled full-frame Nikon with analog controls was irresistible. When I realized Nikon’s implementation of physical dials wasn’t as well executed as Fujifilm’s, I was initially so disappointed that I nearly sent the camera back. I felt frustrated using the Df until I embraced using it in manual mode and stopped trying to make it work in a way that revealed its shortcomings instead of leveraging its strengths. Only then did I realize its most significant benefit was the 16MP sensor borrowed from the D4, making it a low-light beast that produced uniquely beautiful images. I feel very much the same way about the Zf. I’ve only had mine for a couple of weeks, and it has taken a bit of getting used to, but each outing makes me like it even more. I have it customized in a way that works for me, and I have found that the muscle memory required to ensure a camera doesn’t get in the way of the creative process is falling into place quicker with this camera than any I’ve owned. I’ve shot it with the Z 50mm f/1.8 and used the FTZ adapter to mount up some of my favorite older lenses, including my beloved Nikkor 28mm f/2.8 AI-S. Manual focus is a breeze on the Zf, and the results have been great. If you are looking for a compact, lightweight camera with “what you see is what you get” analog dials that exactly mimic the experience of shooting with a film camera, you may be better served with one of the Fujifilm retro-styled bodies, or if cost is no object, one of the Leica Q cameras. But if you are looking for a camera that offers some of Nikon’s most advanced technology, performance, and features cloaked in a well-crafted, solid, substantive, and beautiful package at a very reasonable price point, it’s easy to see why the Zf has been so highly praised and well-received. As for me, this is the beginning of a very fulfilling long-term relationship, and I’ve already decided that the Zf is a camera I will never sell.

Despite popular opinion, it is one of the safest and lowest carbon forms of energy. It is also one of the few on-demand forms of low-carbon energy. As such, it will be a crucial technology as we transition to net-zero. However, the nuclear industry faces a massive problem: it costs too much. New nuclear power plants cost tens of billions of dollars and take well over a decade to build, and once built, the energy they produce is some of the most expensive on the market. This has led many governments and energy providers to distance themselves from this planet-saving technology. But a new type of reactor called an SMR promises to solve all of these issues and kick-start a nuclear renaissance, saving the nuclear industry. However, a pioneering SMR project has just been cancelled because costs are ballooning out of control. So, the question has to be asked: is the future of nuclear energy doomed? Possibly not. Let’s start at the beginning: what is an SMR? SMR stands for Small Modular Reactor. Typical nuclear power plants have several enormous custom-built reactors. These are incredibly complex and must be carefully and accurately assembled on-site. This skyrockets the construction cost and deployment time. SMRs solve this by using reactors small enough to be fully assembled off-site in a controlled factory and then shipped to the location. These reactors produce less power, so you need more of them, generally over 10, to make a power plant. However, the overall cost of these reactors per MW of power should be far cheaper than regular reactors, as the factory can use economies of scale to lower prices. Deployment should also be far quicker, as reactors can be built ahead of time, and their small nature and controlled production facility make construction far quicker. There is even a flexibility advantage, as an SMR plant can add or remove reactors quickly to better meet demand. Ordinary reactors take decades and billions of dollars to expand their output. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Several companies are pioneering SMR technology. But, the company spearheading the SMR movement is… "

Remember my moaning, whinging, and incessant whining about how biblically heavy and unwieldy the 16-inch MacBook Pro is? Well, it has been replaced by a brand-new 14-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro. I said I’d do it, didn’t I? There’s just one problem — I’ve made a mistake, which has resulted in said 14-inch MacBook Pro immediately winging its way through the Apple returns process. I’ll explain how I’ve cocked up in this M3 Max MacBook Pro review — after I’ve given you my thoughts on Apple’s latest powerhouse laptop. Oh, and I think I’ve worked out who should — and who definitely shouldn’t — buy this thing. It’s all about the new colour, isn’t it? Let’s not kid ourselves. Every single review you’ve watched or read about the M3 MacBook Pro (bar those that focus on the base model) features a Space Black laptop. Because of course it does. Is it black? No, not at all. It’s a deep, deep shade of grey. Does that matter? No, not at all. It just looks very cool and you’ll want one as soon as you see it in person. As for fingerprints and smudges, it fares better than the Midnight MacBook Air, but I need longer with it to see how often the cloth needs to come out. I’ve been testing an M3 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB of unified memory and a 2TB SSD. It’s a beast — because of course it is. It’s also an incredibly expensive machine — £4,199 of my hard-earned English pounds, to be exact. Despite the astronomical cost of entry, these are the best MacBook Pros Apple has ever produced. They’re retro-chunky without feeling ancient, built like tanks, powerful enough to smash through any computing requirement, and will last for an extremely long time. But that’s the problem for Apple; this has been the case since the introduction of the M1-based MacBook Pro in 2021 — it was so far ahead of its time and so powerful that anyone who invested in that generation has no need whatsoever to upgrade to the M3 version.

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads.

Especially for businesses online, upselling is super popular. When it works, that simple move will help your business rake in some serious business. Plus, it’s easier to upsell to existing customers. But offline, things are less straightforward than suggesting a new product while visitors to the landing page wait for the next step. As we’ll see, upselling customers isn’t the quick, promising hack some people preach. It’s not impossible to upsell customers offline, but it’s worth noting these points if you intend to so do. Nothing good comes cheap. To provide “premium” added services as a business, you may have to pay an arm and a leg to put yourself in that position. It’s an overall risky move to make. For some brands, it means upgrading many offerings of their business. For example, think of more expensive products, bigger suites, more staff to provide these extra services, etc., depending on your industry. Okay, those upgrades may be better viewed as investments rather than costs. But are you ready for those extra investments? Realize that some of these investments may take time to yield any returns. Can the business survive the dry spells? If you don’t have the financial backing, forcing yourself to upsell could backfire, especially when those extras cost a lot and don’t sell nearly as fast.

However, a prevailing sentiment among them, encapsulated in the phrase “Cold outreach is dead,” warrants scrutiny. This article delves into the fallacies behind this belief, examining the dynamics of social media growth, the gold rush fallacy, and the enduring vitality of cold outreach. The gold rush fallacy suggests that, much like any gold rush, early adopters reap the greatest rewards. Many respected creators built massive followings by recognizing the potential of platforms like Twitter, and LinkedIn. However, the author contends that the days of gaining 1000 followers from a simple listicle are a relic of the past. In the analogy of a whale effortlessly consuming fish, the article highlights that large creators with six-figure followings, social proof, and established authority naturally attract inbound leads. The irony lies in the fact that for those who were not part of the early wave, building a substantial audience now demands more than just opening one’s metaphorical mouth. Organic inbound leads are ideal but not the sole solution. Contrary to the assertion that “cold outreach is dead,” the argument lies in that entire agencies with automated outreach systems are thriving, generating substantial revenue. While inbound leads work wonders, not everyone can sell personal branding courses. Some individuals run large eight-figure businesses, relying on targeted cold outreach for audience acquisition.

I’ve discovered that sometimes, the depth of pain is best expressed in silence, and it’s a mark of inner strength. Ten years ago, I often pretended to understand things I didn’t, masking my confusion with a facade of knowledge. Ten years later, I’ve embraced humility. I may still pretend to be puzzled sometimes, but it’s a way of acknowledging that I’m continually learning and growing. Life has taught me the importance of staying open to new knowledge.

Bittrex doesn’t differentiate between its expert and beginner customers and provides cutting edge technology to both of them.

https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-trading-bot-c2ffce8acb2a?source=collection_home---------2----------------------------,"Nowadays, there are a lot of paid and free crypto trading bots. It’s a hassle for a crypto trader like you and me to choose between these services. Therefore, this article will help you choose the best bots for trading crypto. A Crypto trading bot is software that helps you automate your trading strategies. In other words, crypto trading bots automatically execute orders based on your trading strategy at your crypto exchange without manual intervention. This reduces risks and gives you an extra edge over manual traders. In the days of Mt.Gox, Bitcoin traders wrote scripts to buy and sell Bitcoin to make profits. Over time these crypto bots became more sophisticated. Today you can trade any altcoin, such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, etc, using these trading bots. More than 90% of crypto trading now happens through these bots today. Exchanges are now stepping into the trading bot space and launching Grid bots and DCA bots to provide better trading tools to their customers and increase trading volume to earn more fees. So if you are trying to maximize your returns, consider using these tools. However, starting with a crypto trading bot might be confusing and overwhelming. Therefore we have picked the best and easy-to-use trading bots for you. Some of the best trading bots for crypto listed below are free and open-source software. If you are a beginner, start with pre-building ready-to-use trading strategy templates, reducing the risk of error when automating your strategy. I tried to keep things short; as Kofi Annan says, “Knowledge is Power. Information is liberating.” I tried to provide you with all the features of the top crypto trading bots in this article. Don’t need to hassle with the API Keys while using Pionex. So far, there are 18 free cryptocurrency bots on Pionex: Pionex Grid Trading Bot, Pionex Leveraged Grid Bot, Pionex Margin Grid Bot, Pionex Infinity Grid Bot, Reverse Grid Bot, Leveraged Reverse Grid Bot, Dollar-Cost Averaging Bot, TWAP Bot, Trailing Take Profit Bot, BTC Moon, ETH Moon, and Spot-Futures Arbitrage Bot (Click here). Pionex is the exchange with in-built crypto trading bots. It’s one of the best free trading bot platforms for cryptocurrency I’ve ever seen since 2017. (the year I started buying crypto :P) It aggregates the liquidity from the Binance.com exchange and Huobi and provides a free trading bot. Pionex also created some products on options trading, such as Lottery, where you can invest as low as $1. Pionex exchange recently launched its Spot-Futures crypto arbitrage bot, providing an alternative to traditional arbitrage bots. Moreover, the Pionex trading bot is easy to use. Therefore, I prefer trading bitcoin with this trading bot. Pionex is safe and has been granted the MAS and MBS licenses from Singapore and the U.S. It is the first crypto trading bot on my list and the best free bot in the market. However, Bitsgap has a better Grid bot when compared to Pionex, but Bitsgap is not free. To learn more, read our Pionex Review. Everyone knows KuCoin is an easy-to-use and safe cryptocurrency exchange. However, KuCoin has few built-in trading bots, such as Grid bots for both spot and futures markets and a DCA bot. Kucoin is an exchange; therefore, these bots will be able to execute trades much better than any third-party bots connecting your crypto exchange using API keys. This provides the best performance compared to other trading bots in this article. However, Pionex has a much better user experience and bot coverage. In addition, the KuCoin trading bot allows you to enjoy free trading strategies. Exchanges are now stepping into the trading bot space and launching Grid bots and DCA bots to provide better trading tools to their customers and increase trading volume to earn more fees. For example, Gate.io and Huobi also have inbuilt trading bots. Bitsgap bot is best known for its unique grid bots. These bots allow you to perform high-frequency trading, which is only accessible to big hedge funds, or you need to buy these tools at high prices. The Grid bot distributes investment proportionally within a trading range predefined by a crypto trader. Each time the buy limit order is filled, the bot places a new sell order right above that price. And vice versa, a new buy order is placed below any filled sell order. As long as the price stays within the borders of the trading range, the bot will be trading non-stop. Furthermore, Bitsgap recently rolled out its Bitsgap Futures trading bot, opening and closing hundreds of small positions daily. Therefore taking smaller returns and minimizing risks. Bitsgap algorithm is designed to maximize profit from buying low and selling high each time the price swings. Automated bots have risk-control features like Stop-loss, Trailing UP, Take profit, and several exit strategies. Moreover, the Bitsgap trading terminal offers you some top-notch tools.

Cryptohopper is a paid crypto trading bot for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But before jumping into the paid membership, you have a free trial for 7 days in Cryptohopper. One of the well-known trading bots on Cryptohopper is the market-making bot. However, compared to Grid bots, Cryptohopper allows you to create your own trading strategies and copy others using the Cryptohopper marketplace. You can also copy trading signals and templates. CryptoHopper telegram bot would help you automate your crypto trading signals. CryptoHopper Marketplace allows you to buy third-party services such as crypto signals, trading strategies, apps, and templates. Moreover, the bot offers a demo trading account, strategy designer, social trading platform, paper trading mode, and market arbitrage tool.

Founded in 2019, I discovered Trality a year later and continue to be impressed by its expanding list of innovative features. Their latest offering is the Trality Marketplace, where crypto bot creators and investors come together for mutually beneficial purposes. Investors can rent profitable bots tailored to individual risk tolerances (low, medium, and high) and investment goals based on a full suite of metrics, while bot creators can now monetize their bots and earn passive income from investors around the world. Most importantly, all bot algorithms remain completely private (every creator retains full IP rights). Trality has also partnered with Binance to offer the Trality Wallet, allowing users to directly deposit funds (credit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, or Google Pay) and immediately start trading 350+ cryptos immediately. Trality built its reputation as a leading European FinTech expert in automation with their one-of-a-kind, in-browser Code Editor, which allows even the most intricate and creative strategies to be written in Python. Can’t code? Trality’s intuitive, user-friendly Rule Builder offers a simple drag-and-drop interface for beginners. A nice additional feature is margin trading, and the platform is also equipped with a power backtester. Pair it with Trality’s proprietary Optimizer to fine-tune parameters and validate your ideas. Once the bot is ready, it can be set up to live-trade on popular exchanges like Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and Bitpanda. Looking ahead, Trality will soon offer two bonus programs (refer-a-friend and a Wallet bonus) and their iOS and Android mobile App. The last thing to note is that the platform has a fair pricing model for users of all experience levels. Their starting plan is absolutely free and timeless, so you can use and test the basic capacity as long as you want. 3Commas is one of the top crypto trading bots.

Furthermore, the feature makes it different from other bitcoin trading bot services. It helps you to automate your portfolio and rebalance it to a specific ratio. The Shrimpy trading bot is one of the excellent cryptocurrency trading bots in 2022, so I am listing it here. However, it is a bot designed for portfolio management, indexing, rebalancing, and strategic backtesting. The best part is rebalancing your portfolio when you are hodling the coins. It supports 10+ crypto exchanges. The Shrimpy crypto trading bot only executes a few trades every day. So it’s better for a HODLER. Shrimpy also released a copy trading feature, using which you can follow other crypto traders. One thing I like about Shrimpy is that it has a chatbox Ao where you can shill your favorite coins. 😃 To learn more, read our Shrimpy review. Quadency provides a lot of inbuilt bots for both beginners and pro traders. The bot they have is the TradingView bot.

Furthermore, the platform provides a range of features and comes out as one of the best Bittrex bots. To learn more, read our Quadency Review.

Wunderbit facilitates the buying and selling crypto assets directly using a credit card, i.e., you can buy bitcoin with a credit card.

To learn more, read the Wunderbit review. Using this bot, you can create new strategies and backtest them. If you are a beginner, you should prefer Shrimpy, Cryptohopper, and Pionex. These trading bots are easy to use and will lessen the complexities. Trading bots work; it will always be your strategy that will create problems for you 😃. The trading bot’s job is to execute the order based on your configuration. So if your configuration, aka trading strategy, is good, you will be unstoppable. Your trading strategy yields profits for you, not the trading bot. However, in some cases like Grid trading bots, they will yield profits if you run them long enough in a sideways market. So if you think are crypto trading bots worth it? Then start with a free one, Pionex. Many functions that a well-executed bot can conduct for you are rebalancing, portfolio management, data collection, intelligent order routing, etc. What exactly can you improve with trading bots? Let’s take a look. Repetitive tasks consume a lot of time and effort. A crypto trading robot will allow you to virtually “copy and paste” specific tasks to conduct trades easily. One of the best ways bots can help with repetition is periodic rebalances. If you want to conduct hourly rebalances, then you’ll need to, as the name suggests, rebalance your portfolio every hour. So, you have two options: Timing and achieving a high degree of accuracy in your trading are essential. Every crypto trade you make can enormously impact your potential earnings. Let’s take an example. Suppose the price of Bitcoin is going down, and you want to sell your position the moment BTC hits the $59,000 support line. If you were to do this manually, you’d have to patiently and carefully observe the price chart, and even then, you may not pull the trigger at the right time. The trading bot can be easily programmed to monitor the market and execute a trade at the correct times. Consider the example of “smart order routing.” It seems pretty easy to understand, right? However, the execution of this trade could be nearly impossible. This is just one of the many examples of the complexities that should be factored in while training. Some strategies could be almost impossible to implement. Trade bots could easily automate these complicated and seemingly impossible strategies. Here are some key points when choosing a new crypto trading bot. As I mentioned, over 90% of the trading happened through automated software. Therefore, everyone from top to bottom is using them, especially the big players. So crypto trading bots are entirely legal. There are different bots because it depends on how crypto trading bots work. Let’s see some major categories. You can try Trality to code your strategy in Python if you are a coder. However, I suggest you use simple drag and drop or If-else solutions such as those provided by HaasOnline, Cryptohopper, or 3commas to automate your trading. They are easy to use and charge almost nothing. Trading bots execute trades on your crypto exchange. Therefore you need to integrate your exchange with tax softwares to export your trades. Once exported, the software automatically calculates your profit and losses and provides a tax calculation report. There are multiple types of trading bots, and getting started with each is different. However, in almost all cases, you need to integrate your crypto exchange with the trading bot. However, creating an API key on an exchange like Binance or others only provides necessary permissions related to trading. For example, do not provide wallet withdrawal permissions. Most trading bot platforms allow you to test your trading strategy with fake money. To automate your trading strategy, you should use the following steps before starting the bot. Let’s see some benefits of using trading bots: Automation — Trading bots enable you to automate your trading strategy. Therefore, if your strategy is sound, bots will help you earn money 24*7. Analyze and Fine-tune — Trading bots provide much information on your strategy's performance. You can analyze this information to fine-tune your strategy. Execution — A trading robot can execute trades much more efficiently than a human. This provides you with an extra edge by avoiding latency and emotions. Let’s also look at some of the disadvantages of trading bots: Beginners should avoid it — Other than Grid trading and maybe copy trading, beginners should avoid custom coding trading strategies. If you sign up on Binance and try to get a Binance trading bot, you are probably trying to rekt yourself. Monitoring — Crypto market is highly volatile. Therefore, you should constantly monitor your bots. Sometimes it might give you sleepless nights. Security — Crypto bots have access to your exchange trading account. Therefore while creating exchange API keys for integrating with exchanges, ensure you provide only needed permissions and profile the history of the trading bot and the team. I have been in crypto for the last 3 years, and here are some pro tips for you. If you want to dig deeper, read our guide on crypto investing. You’re a resident of the USA and wondering how to use a trading bot on Coinbase? Well, various crypto bots providers can help you in that case. From my personal experience, I’d suggest you go with Bitsgap or 3Commas as they are the best Coinbase Pro trading bots available in the market. Alternatively, if you don’t want to pay extra for a monthly subscription, you can choose Pionex. If You're Looking for the best Binance trading bots as a beginner, you can start by using CryptoHopper, Bitsgap, 3Commas, etc. Furthermore, if you like having complete control over your trading bots, Quadency or HaasOnline can be a perfect choice. However, it would help if you only used HaasOnline when you have a basic idea of using HassScript, their coding language, to configure the automated bot. The best Bittrex trading bots include 3Commas, CryptoHopper, Bitsgap, etc. Further, you can also automate your crypto trading free bots. One of them is SuperAlgos. However, SuperAlgos is pretty complex for beginners; hence, you can instead use one of the 16 free trading bots of Pionex. It’s difficult to answer unless you have internal data for these crypto trading bot providers. However, based on traffic analysis, we can see Cryptohopper, Pionex, and Bitsgap are the most successful trading bots. Of course, there are free crypto bots such as Pionex. Some exchanges have inbuilt trading bots, such as Gate.io, Kucoin, and BingX. "

It’s not easy to select the best copy trading platform for you. You need to consider many factors when choosing a copy trading software. Here are some key points you need to check in copy trading apps: Yes, the regulations related to copy trading is similar to trading. However, it depends on your jurisdiction. If your broker or exchange is regulated and authorized by legal authorities and crypto trading is allowed in your jurisdiction, you don’t need to worry. Copy Trading is also prevalent in the Forex and Stock markets. There are hundreds of Forex Copy trader. Here is a list of the best Copy Trade software: You must understand how copy trading works. As the name suggests, copy trading is simply copying the trades. You follow a specific trader, and their trades get copied into your account. In other words, when the trader you are following opens trades in their account, the same trades get open in your account. You can set the lot size (size of the trade), and leverage. I recommend that the trader you are following let them control the lot size and leverage. You must create API keys and connect with copy trading software to provide access. Please ensure you only provide trading-related permission and DO NOT PROVIDE WITHDRAW PERMISSIONS. Nowadays, Crypto exchanges have started providing copy trading services; in those cases, you do not need API keys. Yes, copy trading works. However, you have to be very careful. I have been REKT a few times by following traders without analyzing their historical trades. You can read my experience of copy trading. And also, remember, “High Risk, High Reward.” Therefore, an increased risk must be involved if anyone promises high returns. You must remember a few things if you are new to copy trading. For long-term portfolio building, you can follow our in-house copy-trade solution. Here is brief information and the main difference between all three trading platforms: Social trading Social trading allows new traders to learn and invest by following experienced traders. Most of these platforms enable social media-like features to enable a community experience. When in binary option social trading, you can talk to other traders, share your technical analysis, and comment on others’ posts. Copy-trade Copy Trading is a software application primarily focused on enabling core trading features instead focus on community experience. They provide detailed traders' analysis and enable futures and margin trading for markets such as forex, crypto, and stocks. Most copy trading platforms focus on enabling trading automation tools for their strategies. Mirrors trading You can combine top traders’ strategies and trading approaches with Mirror trading. As a result, mirror trading provides more accurate and predictable trading signals. They are perfect for investors who want to know all the forex trading. Social trading is becoming increasingly popular among crypto investors who want to start generating passive crypto income over time. For newbies just starting their trading journey, copying trades looks quite attractive. Everything is automatic. Trading works in the background, with buy and sell orders running 24/7. And the same can be applied to a professional trader as well. If you simply don’t have the time to watch charts, it only makes sense to let someone else trade for you and copy what they do. That being said, we recommend you never stop learning yourself and not follow traders blindly. This way, you don’t have to trust anyone else with your trading, and you will learn something no one can take away from you. P.S. If you find this article helpful, do share it.

https://medium.com/coinmonks/downsides-of-leveraging-technical-analysis-in-investment-decisions-424b74345a06?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"Investment decision-making is an intricate task that requires keen analysis and a comprehensive understanding of several facets of the market. One of the key constituents of this process is Technical Analysis, a methodology rooted in studying past market trends and patterns to shape future investment moves. However, while it holds significant advantages, Technical Analysis is not without its potential pitfalls. This discussion delves into the nuanced world of Technical Analysis, outlining its methodologies, tools, and teachings while weighing its merits against its limitations. Additionally, this discourse aims to look at the risk of placing undue reliance on Technical Analysis and underscores the value of integrating it with other investment techniques for a more holistic decision-making framework. Mastering Technical Analysis: A Power Play in Investment Decisions In today’s fast-paced world, where every penny and every second count, making prudent investment decisions is an art that can reap extraordinary dividends. One of the most proficient methods that savvy investors often leverage is ‘Technical Analysis.’ This astute tool is the modern investor’s crystal ball, potentially heralding the onset of profit-laden opportunities blanketed within the thick fog of financial markets. Technical Analysis, in layman’s terms, is the science and art of forecasting future price movements by studying past market data, predominantly price and volume. In essence, it’s a method employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity. Where others see daunting charts and perplexing patterns, the seasoned investor sees an opportunity, primarily because Technical Analysis is more than just randomly figuring out patterns. It’s essentially about deciphering an asset’s signals, signals indicating a catalyst that might trigger either a positive or negative price movement. Spurred on by its high-frequency trading potential, technical analysis typically employs three fundamental principles. Firstly, it firmly believes “the market discounts everything.” A stock’s price reflects everything affecting a company, including fundamental factors. Secondary to this, it ascribes that “prices move in trends.” Understanding these trends and trend lines can serve as a valuable tool for predicting future price trajectories. Lastly, the principle that “history tends to get repeated” stands as a testament to the fact that market psychology factors like fear and excitement are consistent through time and reflect in price patterns. Applied with due diligence, Technical Analysis can indeed be a formidable arsenal in an investor’s toolkit. For instance, various trading patterns, such as moving averages, trend lines, or oscillators, act as predictive tools, highlighting the possibility of a noteworthy change in a price trend. Furthermore, add innovative tools like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), or Bollinger Bands, and you’ve got a spaceship dashboard on your trading screens, helping assess price directions with hawk-eyed precision. Additionally, the discipline applies not just to stocks but across a spectrum of financial assets — bonds, commodities, or cryptocurrencies — all grist to the technical analyst’s data-driven mill. It’s worth noting that despite its merits, Technical Analysis should never be used in isolation. We believe that the most successful investors use both technical and fundamental analysis in tandem. Fundamental analysis will often indicate what to buy, while Technical Analysis will suggest when. This blended approach often produces an eloquent symphony of well-calculated decisions and formidable returns. In conclusion, the power of Technical Analysis in investment decisions, when appropriately used, can be a game-changing strategy. It’s about time this sophisticated skill is unveiled from the shroud of complexities to be used as an essential driver for navigating the convoluted labyrinths of financial markets. Embracing Technical Analysis is investing in the strongest asset class — Knowledge! AI Image by Writio Technical analysis, as a key tool to predict the future movements of financial asset prices, has the potential to drive impressive investment returns, but it can also lead to disappointing outcomes when used in isolation. This occurrence is primarily due to the overreliance on this method, which can lure investors into a false sense of security. The limitations of technical analysis become apparent when considering that it predominantly focuses on patterns and trends. It often ignores an essential component, which is the intrinsic value of a business. Without the backdrop of the fundamental health and prospective profitability of a company, technical analysis can mislead even the most experienced investors. Therefore, any investment decision solely based on technical analysis can potentially overlook a business’s real worth, leading to sub-par investment outcomes. Moreover, while technical analysis can help identify the market’s directions and price levels that could indicate potential trading opportunities, it is essentially reactive. Technical analysis depends heavily on past data and assumes that history will, by some means, repeat itself. However, future prices do not necessarily follow past patterns and trends. In reality, stock prices often deviate from these patterns due to a wide variety of unpredictable events, including regulatory decisions, macroeconomic changes, or management shifts. Another potential pitfall of being overly dependent on technical analysis is the premise of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It may occur when a large number of investors believe in the same patterns and act correspondingly, causing the price to move in the predicted direction temporarily. However, when mass sentiment shifts, which inevitably happens, the trend can reverse suddenly, trapping those who followed it initially, and leading to financial losses. The application of technical analysis must be tempered with a sound understanding of the overall financial market conditions and the specific circumstances surrounding an individual company or asset. It’s crucial to view it as part of a multi-dimensional approach to decision-making. Furthermore, overreliance on technical analysis could lead to excessive trading. Frequent buying and selling can incur significant transaction costs and take a heavy toll on the overall investment return. It can also lead to amplified emotional investing, with investors getting caught up in the highs and lows of the market, rather than maintaining a long-term, disciplined approach. In conclusion, while technical analysis is an invaluable tool in the investment toolkit, it is just that — a tool. It should be used in conjunction with other evaluation techniques such as fundamental and quantitative analysis to achieve balanced, robust investment strategies. By moving beyond a single-minded focus on technical analysis to a more holistic perspective, investors can significantly increase their chances of generating better investment outcomes and secure a prosperous financial future. AI Image by Writio As the twilight of reliance on any single method of investment decision-making highlights, a more multifaceted approach is requisite for modern-day investing. The adept investor should be grounded in a more well-rounded strategy that embraces but does not lean entirely on technical analysis. A diversified approach is vital to mitigate inherent shortcomings of technical analysis in investment stratagems. Here are pivotal methods to that concrete end. Foremost It is key to remain flexible and take on a contrarian mindset. This might seem counterintuitive in a practice based on historical trends, but markets are constantly adjusting to an array of many variables: political circumstances, natural disasters, global pandemics, etc. The contrarian investor knows that sometimes, the crowd is wrong, and thereby, charts can be too. By remaining fluid in changeable market circumstances, it becomes possible to adapt investment practices for continued success. Next Let’s applaud risk management. Not every investment decision, no matter how influenced by meticulous technical analysis, will bear fruit. Staying sober to the unpredictable dynamics of the market and accordingly, managing risk with such tools as stop-loss orders, puts a guard against dire losses. Then again The keen investor should indulge in market psychology. Efficient markets are a nebulous ideal; in reality, markets are often influenced by human emotions. Fear and greed, euphoria and panic — emotions create discrepancies between a security’s price and its intrinsic value. Capitalizing on understanding these sentiments can decrease reliance on patterns and increase profitability. Moreover Understanding economic indicators and cycles can enhance the effectiveness of technical analysis. Key financial reports, leadership changes, and financial calamities could drastically shift market trends. Being literate about economic cycles aids in predicting long-term patterns, thus taking technical analysis a step further. Lastly A more comprehensive methodology entails judiciously incorporating fundamental analysis to balance the scales. While technical analysis tips its hat to market trends and investor behavior, fundamental analysis rather heeds the financial atlas of a company. Combining the two gives the investor the very backbone of the history and a vision of the prospects of the investment. This is not to belittle the influence of technical analysis. It holds a sterling place in the arsenal of astute investors and traders. The idea, however, is to not be bound by one instrument. The masterful investor is essentially a maestro, deftly tuning the diverse instruments of analysis to create a harmonious, successful concerto of smart and lucrative investment decisions. As succinctly put forward by the famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”. Wise words to heed — pointing towards the need for a balanced and flexible investment strategy. Ai Image by Writio Recognizing the limitations of Technical Analysis can significantly improve its efficacy as a tool for investment decisions. Its inability to accurately predict future market trends based on historical data and assess a company’s intrinsic value is proof that reliance on it can’t be overstated. Nevertheless, it doesn’t undermine its value as a stepping stone towards a more multifaceted approach to investment. By integrating Technical Analysis with other modes of analysis like Fundamental Analysis, investors can glean insightful nuances that lead to informed and lucrative decisions. Therefore, the key rests not in renouncing Technical Analysis but in understanding and harnessing its potential optimally in coherence with other techniques. In conclusion, while technical analysis can be beneficial for identifying trends and patterns in the market, it has its downsides that investors should be aware of.

As this alliance takes shape, the potential national security implications loom large, drawing unsettling parallels to historical events like 9/11. ### **Financial Interests and National Security** The utilization of retirement funds, often considered a safeguard for citizens' future, in investment ventures tied to the governing council's centralization, raises questions about the alignment of financial interests with national security priorities. The concentration of power in the hands of a few, particularly through pivotal entities like BlackRock, may have ramifications for the stability of the nation. ### **Control Over Critical Infrastructure** The companies represented within the Hedera Governing Council often operate critical infrastructure, making them integral to the functioning of the nation. BlackRock's significant ownership stakes could translate into substantial influence over key sectors, potentially impacting national security, especially in times of crisis. ### **Potential for Economic Manipulation** BlackRock's massive control over corporations in the governing council introduces the risk of economic manipulation. This concentrated influence could be wielded in ways that compromise the integrity of financial systems, posing threats to the economic stability of the nation. ### **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency** The covert nature of these financial maneuvers, involving retirement funds and influential corporate shares, raises concerns about transparency. Lack of visibility into such dealings could hinder the ability to detect and prevent activities that may undermine national security. ### **Parallels to Historical Threats** Drawing parallels to historical events, such as 9/11, where covert financial operations played a role, underscores the gravity of the situation. While the context differs, the potential impact on national security remains a shared concern – the concentration of financial power in a few hands, especially when tied to critical infrastructure, demands careful scrutiny. ### **Navigating the Balance** As the nation grapples with these intricate financial dynamics, a delicate balance must be struck between economic growth and safeguarding national security. Vigilance, transparency, and informed discourse are imperative to ensure that the financial landscape remains resilient and aligned with the best interests of the United States and its citizens. "
https://medium.com/coinmonks/2-safe-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-at-the-end-of-november-1766ddd0260d?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"The cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) aims to provide a cheaper and quicker alternative to traditional international money transfers. Ignoring its promise, XRP has recently gotten entangled in a litigation pending before the SEC. A response from Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple, to remarks made by Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, is relevant to recent events. His argument is that the Supreme Court’s handling of Ripple’s and the company’s continuing legal dispute has been biassed. At issue is the Hinman Document, which Alderoty claims inserted prejudice into the proceedings. Additional news has emerged from Ripple Labs, who say they will enhance the XRP Ledger’s liquidity and trading efficiency by integrating automated market makers. Concerns about possible stability difficulties have been met with optimism about increasing liquidity by other members of the XRP community. The result of the SEC lawsuit is a significant aspect for investors since it has a direct impact on the price of XRP. Yet, XRP is a blue-chip cryptocurrency that should be part of your portfolio if it can weather the storm. With its emphasis on instant transactions and backing for decentralised application development, Solana (SOL-USD) has become a popular cryptocurrency among digital investors. Notable developments like as Google Cloud’s integration of Solana data into BigQuery demonstrate the network’s increasing significance. Not only does this change facilitate access to archived data for developers and businesses, but it also highlights the need of having simple and rapid access to data created on the Solana network.

Prepare for a trek into the cutting-edge collaboration that has propelled the field of artificial intelligence (AI) into a new era. The recent alliance between SingularityNET and Dfinity Foundation signifies a crucial turning point, steering towards the establishment of a decentralized AI (DeAI) network. This groundbreaking venture harnesses the prowess of smart contracts and the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, perhaps the best and currently undervalued blockchain in existence. It can simply do things all the rest cannot do. In the realm of DeAI, autonomy reigns supreme. Unlike its traditional AI counterparts, often governed by corporate giants like Microsoft or Google, DeAI operates without the dominion of a singular entity. The advantages are manifold: Transparency and Trust Amplification: DeAI models, being open source, invite scrutiny from all quarters, fostering heightened trust by allowing anyone to inspect them for flaws or biases.Greater Accessibility: Free from the clutches of a single entity, DeAI models become more accessible to a diverse audience, potentially democratizing the realm of AI.Reduced Risk of Censorship: DeAI models navigate a less restrictive landscape compared to their centralized counterparts, as they are not beholden to the dictates of a singular authority. Smart contracts, those self-executing marvels residing on the blockchain, emerge as the architects of efficiency, automating myriad tasks, including the execution of AI models. The Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, tailor-made for smart contract execution, emerges as the ideal crucible for AI models due to its commendable transaction speed. The collaboration between SingularityNET and Dfinity Foundation stands as a pivotal stride forward in the evolution of DeAI. The fusion of smart contracts and the ICP blockchain holds the promise of rendering DeAI models more transparent, accessible, and secure — propelling the responsible and ethical utilization of AI. Beyond the highlighted advantages, DeAI holds the potential to: Cost Efficiency in AI Development: DeAI models can be developed and deployed with a more frugal expenditure compared to their traditional counterparts, courtesy of reduced infrastructure and support requirements.Enhanced AI Efficiency: DeAI models showcase heightened efficiency by operating on a distributed network of computers, mitigating latency issues and elevating overall performance.Scalability in AI: DeAI models exhibit superior scalability, effortlessly deploying to new nodes on the network, presenting a scalability advantage over traditional AI models. The SingularityNET and Dfinity Foundation collaboration augurs well for the landscape of artificial intelligence, promising to imbue DeAI with qualities such as transparency, accessibility, security, efficiency, scalability, and affordability. This holds profound implications for societal evolution. However, even amidst these optimistic strides, it is imperative to acknowledge that not all developments in the AI realm garner unanimous approval. Take, for instance, the recent departure of Sam Altman from OpenAI and his subsequent alignment with Microsoft, sparking noteworthy controversy. Altman’s move has encountered resistance from OpenAI employees, with hundreds contemplating departure. The board’s loss of confidence in Altman precipitated his exit. His transition to Microsoft, a company synonymous with centralized AI control, seemingly contradicts DeAI principles, instigating concerns regarding the trajectory of AI development. This serves as a poignant reminder of the necessity to uphold DeAI principles in the face of industry dynamics in flux. Which will the world choose… decentralized or centralized artificial intelligence? It’s up to us now.

https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-this-is-the-best-time-to-run-a-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-cd1bf89709aa?source=collection_home---------9----------------------------,"Successful traders prepare themselves by waiting for the right opportunity before making their moves. Sometimes the right thing to do, in a market is to do nothing. It takes both knowledge and patience to recognize when it’s time to wait and when is act. A healthy market needs volatility. And boy did the crypto market deliver. Just this month, Solana saw a dramatic price fluctuation. It rose over 300% from the end of October, now trading at around $56. BTC, ETH as well as many other alts have also seen dramatic spikes in price. This kind of volatility is exactly what cryptocurrency trading bots are for. You see, every drastic market movement is usually followed by a correction. It’s these corrections that offer some of the best opportunities to pocket in some profit while increasing the size of your investment. It’s hard to determine exactly the threshold at which point a spike will have a sudden and immediate correction, but with practice, you’ll get better at detecting them. For instance, take a look at the chart below. This is a 10% pump followed immediately by an 8% correction. Timing this perfectly is nearly impossible, but entering around the time the spike has ended, or shortly after can still generate a good, and more importantly, consistent return. The best thing about this approach is that in the current market conditions is that it’s repeatable. Because it’s repeatable, it’s the perfect strategy to consider automating. Algorithmic crypto trading platforms like Aesir are perfect for automating these kinds of strategies. They’re easy to use and best of all, allow you to safely test a strategy in a virtual environment with no risk, so you can double-check that your strategy indeed works the way you intend it to, without exposing yourself to unnecessary risks. Not only are the market conditions ideal for this kind of swing trading, but many Algo trading platforms out there are also giving out massive Black Friday discounts for a limited time. For instance, Aesir is offering 70% off on all subscriptions forever with code AESIRBF70 at checkout. This is the best value that users can get, and a premium subscription unlocks powerful new features such as Paper Trading, Trailing Stop Loss, Faster execution, and more complex trading bot logic. The only thing to keep in mind is that testing a strategy is absolutely vital to its success. Especially with swing trading where it’s unclear where that sweet spot is. That’s why most Algo trading platforms allow you to run multiple bots in parallel to and see how they perform. However, unlike other platforms, Aesir was specifically designed with swing trading in mind. Whether long or short term, Aesir allows you to select a Price Volatility threshold and a Time window. For instance — you could create a bot that scans all coins on Binance and places a buy (or sell order) when the price rises by at least 10% in the last 20 minutes. Naturally, you’re free to use other indicators such as MACD, RSI, and even computed TradingView Indicators. However, many moving average indicators are known as “lagging indicators” meaning they follow the price, and not the other way around. Whatever you approach — test and optimize. That’s all for today. If you do want to start dabbling into algorithmic trading, don’t forget to grab the coupon code for Aesir — AESIRBF70 "

Among these traditional assets, copper stands out for its widespread use and economic significance. Copper isotopes, particularly Copper-63 and Copper-65, have industrial and scientific importance, while in the digital realm, cryptocurrencies like Edelcoin represent the new frontier of asset tokenization. This article delves into the intersection of these seemingly disparate worlds, exploring how they are becoming increasingly interconnected. Copper is a cornerstone of the industrial economy and is essential in electrical wiring, plumbing, telecommunications, and renewable energy systems. Its properties, such as high conductivity, malleability, and resistance to corrosion, make it indispensable in modern technology. The metal exists naturally in two stable isotopic forms, Copper-63 and Copper-65, with natural abundances of approximately 69% and 31%, respectively. According to the latest data from the U.S. Geological Survey, global mine production of copper reached about 20 million metric tons in 2021. The price of copper is subject to minor market fluctuations due to its industrial demand and mining outputs. Copper-63 and Copper-65 have specialized uses in scientific fields. Copper-63 is used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique to observe local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei. Copper-65, due to its potential as a gamma-ray source, finds applications in medical and industrial radiography. The market for these isotopes is stable and determined by their rarity and the cost of enrichment. While there is no publicly traded market for copper isotopes, their value is tied to the broader copper market and the specific demands of the sectors they serve. Cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary digital asset class, offering a decentralized, secure, and borderless means of transaction. Cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This technology ensures transparency, security, and immutability, appealing attributes for users. Edelcoin represents an innovative step in asset-backed digital currencies. It is a cryptocurrency backed by a basket of precious and base metals. The concept behind Edelcoin and similar tokens is to combine the tangible value of traditional assets with the efficiency and liquidity of cryptocurrency. The idea is to provide a stable payment option within the volatile crypto market, as the underlying value of the token is tied to a physical commodity with intrinsic value. This mitigates price swings associated with cryptocurrencies, as the token’s value can be anchored to the more stable prices of the metals backing it. Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This can apply to any asset, including real estate, art, or, as with Edelcoin, precious metals. The benefits of tokenization are manifold: The intersection of traditional assets like copper and the innovative world of cryptocurrency represents a fascinating evolution in how we think about value and ownership. Copper isotopes such as Copper-63 and Copper-65 have critical industrial and scientific applications, while cryptocurrencies like Edelcoin aim to leverage the stability of such assets to create a new kind of opportunity. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the fusion of traditional and modern asset classes through tokenization may become more prevalent. However, as with any emerging technology, it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence, stay informed about regulatory changes, and consider the inherent risks and opportunities that come with cryptocurrencies. The future of asset management could be on the blockchain, and copper, an ancient metal, may find a new lease of life in this digital age. Edelcoin has the potential to create a more accessible, efficient, and secure crypto environment. Read our article on Caesium-133. Follow us on social media for more updates.

Are you ready to dive in and start having fun while earning rewards? Server Boss: You can attack the server boss every hour, and you’ll receive random crypto loot. When the server boss is defeated, the loot is distributed to players. Dealing with higher damage increases your chances of winning, similar to a raffle. Higher levels and better items lead to more damage. Solo Bosses: As you level up, you unlock access to different server bosses. Max-level players can attack solo bosses ranging from level 20 to level 50, offering more opportunities to earn crypto loot. Attacks on these bosses occur every hour until they’re defeated. Your loot depends on the boss’s level and rarity. Dungeons: You can attempt dungeons once every 24 hours by paying a gold fee. Each dungeon features five bosses, and there’s no cooldown between attacks. This provides multiple chances to earn crypto loot. When you defeat the final boss, you’ll also receive items to increase your damage, gold, and shards for crafting. Clan Raids: There are two types of clan raids. The server-wide clan raid features a boss with a substantial amount of HP, much like the server boss. Attacking it rewards you with cryptocurrency, and once it’s defeated, you can loot very rare crafting materials, providing significant attack boosts. The other type is an exclusive clan boss with lower HP but a time limit. Only a maximum of 10 players can participate in this raid, offering more chances to acquire valuable raid crafting materials. These can also be traded in the upcoming marketplace update. Daily Chests: Daily chests can be opened every 24 hours. These chests come in different rarities, with higher rarities containing better loot, including instant crypto rewards, a chance for shards, and gold. Additionally, there’s a daily Twitter raffle for all activated accounts. By participating in this activity, you have a chance to win 0.25 SOL($8.48) to 0.5 SOL ($16.3) every day. It’s another exciting way to earn cryptocurrency on NFTQUEST.AI! Choose the package you want. Gems are used for upgrading your equipment, buying crafting materials, and increasing your chances of looting higher-tiered items and crypto tokens.

Today we gather together to take a deep dive into the Neptune Network. I’m Neptune Administrator Albert, your host for today’s AMA. @Anthony_Jack1 welcomes Anthony Jack, CEO of Neptune Networks Hello Albert! Nice to connect with you Thanks and Welcome 😇 Very glad to be here So, let’s start today’s AMA. Start with a basic introductionDon’t forget to type “Done” after your answer✅ Got it Albert! Let’s start Before we begin, can you tell us a little more about yourself? I’m Anthony Jack, CEO from Neptune Networks, with over 10 years of experience in venture-backed growth companies. You must be familiar with me, because my personal information is displayed on the official website of Neptune Network.DONE Yes, of course I understand, but many users don’t. Let’s move on to the introductory partQ1. Please introduce the background and goals of your NT project? Of course I will introduce the Neptune Network in detail next Neptune Network was established in London, UK. The Neptune Network team was founded by Anthony Jack. It is a truly decentralized network. Our aim is to create multi-millionaires. And everyone worked together to build it. After the NT token is listed. Let NT tokens become the ecological currency of WEB3 ecological sustainability. Let NT tokens continue to circulate, so that NT tokens will continue to rise. The issuance of NT tokens by Neptune Network will cover the whole world. It will be used in both virtual and real world at the same time. It will open up an entire unprecedented innovative WEB3 ecosystem.DONE Q2. Many users ask whether Neptune Network is the same as other projects? How does NT differentiate itself from other cryptocurrency projects? First of all, any exchange has the same characteristics. For example, are Binance and other exchanges similar, and each crypto wallet has little difference. The difference between NT and other projects is that Neptune Network truly enables NT users to create wealth. Neptune is positioned as a decentralized network. And NT is a privacy protection project based on blockchain technology. Focus on secure and transparent transactions, including algorithms using specific technical architecture and consensus.DONE Q3. Who are the members of the project team, their background and experience? Neptune Network was created by me. Has more than 10 years of cryptocurrency trading experience. At the same time, William Carr CPTO in the team is the responsible security expert and has more than 10 years of advanced cryptography experience and holds 5 patents. You can click here to read the detailed introduction.https://neptune.bet/resource/Neptune%20Network%20Whitepaper.htmlDONE Q4. There are many new NT users who actually do not understand the NT roadmap. What important milestones have been achieved? In fact, there is a clear NT roadmap on the official website and white paper . If you really want to understand a project, what you need to do is learn.DONE Q5.What is the use of NT tokens in this project? Is there an incentive mechanism? NT is a token issued by Neptune Network. This is the main thing. Because NT tokens depend on everyone’s wealth. We have a very good mechanism. Every time you invite a user and bind your invitation code, both parties can get 5000 NT tokens.DONE Q6.What is the community development plan of the NT project? NT actively participates in various social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, etc. to interact and communicate with community members. Keep the community engaged and informed by regularly publishing project progress, latest news, and important announcements.DONE Q7. Can you explain in a simple way how NT works? In fact, it is very simple. There are two ways of Neptune Network: 2. Participate in DeFi transactions and earn 0.45% passive income every day. Monthly income is 13.5%. You can also earn profit bonuses for subsets of income at levels 1–10%, levels 2–9%, and levels 3–8%. Got these two points. You can then move on to learn about the specific vision of Neptune Networks DONE Q8. When will NT tokens be listed? In other words, how to withdraw NT tokens? When can I redeem it? According to the white paper plan, Neptune Network will be listed in January 2024. Since NT users actively participated in the construction. It’s expected to be available on Christmas Eve. But whether it can be listed on Christmas Eve in advance depends on everyone’s joint efforts. Everyone needs to invite more users to participate in receiving NT tokens. And actively participate in DEFI transactions. Both of these methods can promote the listing of NT tokensDONE Q9. A question that many NT users are concerned about is, will the NT tokens maintain their original value after they are listed? Anthony Jack：The NT users actively participated in the construction. Also operated by the Neptune Network team. The value of NT tokens will continue to rise. Because NT tokens are an important credential for the Neptune Network in the ecosystem.DONE Let’s move on to the next part — Twitter Questions Q1 How does DeFi trading work? DeFi trading is how blockchain works. It is truly decentralized finance. There are smart contracts that completely replace manual labor. Guaranteed long-term stable profits for users. DeFi stands for decentralized finance. It refers to a class of financial applications and systems that run on a blockchain network, providing reliability, transparency and interoperability. DeFi allows individuals to borrow and lend digital assets without relying on centralized institutions. Neptune users can borrow assets by staking existing cryptocurrencies, and lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to lending pools, earning a steady income (0.45%) on a daily basis.DONE Q2 How to participate in Defi transactions? What is its profit? How to ensure the safety of my funds? To participate in DeFi transactions, you need to deposit USDT or TRX, rather than using your NT tokens to participate in DeFi transactions. For details, you can refer to the DeFi steps.https://t.me/NTNetwork2/77 The passive income from participating in DeFi transactions is 0.45% per day. As for fund security, DeFi trading itself is a decentralized transaction and is regulated by FATF and complies with the regulations of the US SEC. Ensure legal compliance. Your principal and profits can be withdrawn at any time without any risk.DONE Q3 How will you manage your #NeptuneNetwork platform if an unexpected issue arises in the future, especially a hacking issue that results in your platform having some personal data of certain users? Is your platform ready for this? Neptune Network is similar to a crypto wallet. During the registration process, you only need to keep your private key and bind Google Authenticator, and no user personal data is involved. And the technical department of the Neptune team is headed by cyber security expert William Carr. Have more than 10 years of advanced cryptography experience. Neptune Network will not face this problem, please don’t worry.DONE Q4 When can the wallet be downloaded again from Google Play ? If we go to the play store again we would gain a lot of confidence, Mr. Anthony, do it again please Because the technical department has been improving all functions and submitted a Google Play application. Because Neptune Network is more than just games. Including finance and WEB3 ecology. Therefore, the manual review process will be stricter, and Google Play will be re-listed in the near future.DONE Q5. Does NT recruit ambassadors or partners?What are the benefits of becoming a partner? Neptune Network currently has over 900 ambassadors around the world. Recruiting more all the time. For specific ambassador benefits and conditions, interested parties can contact the administrator to learn more.Support Team: https://t.me/Neptune_AdminRecruitment announcement: https://t.me/NTNetwork2/61DONE Q6 Why do NT users need to participate in DeFi transactions? Regarding DeFi transactions, because many well-known exchanges require a certain group size, DeFi transaction amount and number of transactions before they can go online. Therefore, whether users are invited to participate in receiving NT tokens or participating in DeFi transactions, it will help build the Neptune network ecosystem.DONE Let’s move on to the next part — live questions 😇 Neptune citizens who asked questions live Hello dear Mr. Anthony Jack, I hope that you and your family are well, I want to ask you the following question, according to the white paper, will Neptune Network be listed on Binance and Huobi in january 2024 ? Thanks. The listing of NT tokens is currently in the process of reaching a preliminary cooperation strategy with large-scale transactions. Many exchanges need to reach designated DEFI trading volume. NT will do its best to list well-known exchanges. At the same time, we hope that NT users will actively participate in the construction of NT.DONE - According to its roadmap In January 2024, NT TOKEN will be listed on the major exchanges. How will this listing take place and what opportunities will it open up for Neptune Network users? The Neptune team is currently actively preparing for the listing of NT tokens. Promote the construction of NT. After the NT token is listed. Everyone is a shareholder of Neptune Network. Owning NT tokens means owning wealth.DONE My questions:1. Apart from Google Authentication, are there other security measures like KYC, etc. before exchange or listing? 2. Will NT Token consider developing a contract address? 3. The target of every crypto is the generality of people. What is the management doing to ensure every gadget access to the Token? The community would have grown past where it is now. 1. In addition to Google Authenticator, the Neptune Network team currently does not require other KYC certification. Just keep your private key safe.2.NT Token will consider developing contracts. Because this is a necessary condition for listing3. As answered in the AMA. After the NT token is listed, as long as you participate in the construction of NT. Then ensure that each user can access the token normally. The construction and development of the community depends on NT users. At the same time, it determines the increase in the value of NT.DONE How does the Neptune Network ensure fairness and transparency in all DeFi transactions, and what measures are in place to address any potential risks for users participating in these transactions?How many team members does Neptune Network have? Do they have enough experience in the blockchain field? Do they have any experience working in both crypto and non-crypto projects?@Anthony_Jack1 The Neptune Network is a truly decentralized network. Distributed management by smart contracts. Leverage blockchain technology. Every transaction is stored on the chain. Fairness and transparency are guaranteed. At the same time, we have security encryption experts with more than 10 years of CPTO experience. Security is ensured.The main members of Neptune are composed of 4 people. Team members consist of 50 people. Team development is slowly being expanded. You can refer to the background and experience of team members, which are introduced in detail.https://t.me/NTNetwork2/13DONE Me acabo de registrar me dieron un bono de 500 no se que se hace con ese bono o si todo es automático Those who register will receive 5000NT tokens worth 500USDT. The redemption function is not yet enabled.Need to actively participate in NT construction. Invite more real users to receive NT tokens. Promote the listing of NT tokens. It can be successfully exchanged freely after listing.DONE This ends this AMA. Thanks to Mr. Anthony Jack for answering questions for our citizens of Neptune.🥂 Thanks also to all Neptune citizens for their active participation. I hope that all citizens of Neptune can move forward with inspiration and create a complete DEFI decentralized network. "
https://medium.com/@subhashishc/solanas-surges-which-cryptos-will-follow-next-ed565b909bf3?source=read_next_recirc-----e4adf641567f----1---------------------d3be38ea_8ab2_4659_9191_72cced1d71ed-------,"Today we will discuss the current Solana rally and the ongoing explosion in the market. Instead, I will cover what I believe will be the next rotation of liquidity in the market. This involves understanding where current speculators in Solana are taking profits, especially those in the ecosystem from early on, and where they are likely to move next. I believe this is a more attractive and crucial play, so that will be our focus today. Everything I cover here today in this article is for short to medium-term swing opportunities. This piece will especially be relevant if you’re fearing FOMO and planning to take any positions due to the current price surge. And just to be clear at the beginning, I continue to be bullish on Solana (SOL) over the long term irrespective of the short-term volatility that's imminent. First, let’s address the current position of Solana. It’s starting to look like a really good time to start taking profits. The chart, even on the 4-hour timeframe, shows significant gains of around 12%. If this momentum continues, we could see up to a 50% increase in a single day, which is not sustainable. If I still had any Solana at this point, I would definitely be taking profits and at least waiting for a pullback before buying it more. The risk-reward ratio no longer seems favorable to me. While Solana has been performing well, it’s important to note that I don’t condone being too interested in it for the short term, especially when compared to other opportunities. Similar to when Chainlink rallied to $15 recently, I didn’t find it particularly appealing due to its aggressive growth. Solana had been consolidating since November 1st, and I was watching it closely for a breakout. When it broke out on the 7th, I took profits in the 50s, which I consider a good enough profit. Many people on Twitter are talking about the Solana ecosystem’s significant gains. You can verify this by looking at the various projects within the Solana ecosystem on CoinGecko. Most of them have seen substantial increases in value, and this excitement is driving the liquidity within the ecosystem. The surge in the Solana ecosystem extends beyond the primary coin to include altcoins such as Bonk and Radium, which have seen substantial gains. I had covered these in my altcoins for the month and last which you can check out. Folks who got in soon would be sitting on a good profit in a short time. Should you be getting in now in these? The answer is NO. Solana and the ecosystem coins are poised for a correction after which you can consider taking positions. Currently, it is largely driven by speculative trading rather than long-term growth potential. This pattern is consistent with past market behaviors, indicating that the current focus on the Solana ecosystem will soon shift. Now, let’s discuss where I believe the money will flow next. This rotation of money to different ecosystems is a common occurrence at this junction of the bull run. In the past, we’ve witnessed similar rotations between Solana, Luna, and Avalanche (AVAX) in the previous cusp of bull runs of late 2021 and prior. This happens because the crypto market is driven by sentiment and traders and degens looking for on-chain opportunities. When one ecosystem becomes overbought, traders move to the next. In the current market, Solana is the center of attention. However, I believe it’s time to focus on the next potential hotspots. These shifts can happen quickly, so it’s essential to stay ahead of the curve. I’ve entered a trade in Avalanche at around $14.50, with a stop loss at $12 and a take profit target of at least $20. Avalanche and Solana are both considered Ethereum killers, and historically, money has flowed between these ecosystems during bull runs. In addition to Avalanche, I’m closely monitoring the Arbitrum ecosystem. Arbitrum is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, and it has an incentive program that attracts swing traders. I’ve also entered a trade in Arbitrum as I believe it has the potential for significant growth in the next week. Focus on the top projects within these ecosystems to maximize your investment opportunities as well. If we want to go deeper into these ecosystems, we can look at specific altcoins within them. In the Avalanche ecosystem, I’m interested in GMX, Radiant Capital, Benqi Protocol, Trader Joe, and Camelot. These projects are either decentralized exchanges or lending and borrowing platforms exclusively built for the Avalanche and Arbitrum ecosystem. They have the potential to perform well as liquidity flows into the ecosystem. Arbitrum is attractive because it’s popular among DeFi traders, and the incentive program is boosting yield percentages. Despite AVAX’s overall growth, these particular platforms are still undervalued, so there is potential for significant returns. Similarly, in the Arbitrum ecosystem, platforms linked to Ethereum, like GMX and Radiant Capital are poised for a breakout as well. Beyond AVAX and Arbitrum, Polygon (MATIC) also emerges as a contender, especially with its impending upgrade to Polygon 2.0 and the rebranding of its MATIC token to POL. Polygon has undergone a token upgrade to become the Polygon (Pol) token, with new tokenomics. While Polygon’s ecosystem is not primarily DeFi-focused, the rebranding and token upgrade are going to attract attention. Do pay attention to the process. These ecosystem rotations only happen a few times. Usually, by the third time it occurs, it dies completely. This is because everyone is still very enthusiastic about the Solana ecosystem, and they’re willing to invest in Solana altcoins. When these people move on to AVAX, they’ve already witnessed the rise and fall in the Solana ecosystem, so they want to make the rotation much faster. They invest in the top AVAX altcoins, and once they see gains, they are likely to exit quickly and move on to the next chain, whether it’s Arbitrum or Polygon. This process becomes faster as people become more accustomed to this way of trading. That’s why I wouldn’t recommend getting into very small ecosystems. Staying ahead of these shifts is crucial for maximizing opportunities and profits. — — Enjoyed my article? It would mean a lot if you give a clap 🙂.Don’t forget to follow for more crypto alpha.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

In my opinion, it’s definitely better than the above: For pivot point detection I already proposed an approach in this story: However, during my tests it turned out that the pivot points created by this method are reasonably good, but it’s better to have too much pivot points instead of losing an important one. “Bad” ones can be filtered out later.

If you want to earn money you need to be consistent and be active every day, at least in the beginning. So my advice is to choose a niche that you are passionate about because otherwise after the first couple of months of earning 2–3$ you will decide to quit. Even on holidays I would take my laptop and after lunch I would go to the beach and start writing an article. You can’t do this unless you do it with passion. After choosing your niche go to Medium.Com and you have on the right side Recommended topic and click on See more topics. For example we will chose niche Artificial Intellingence with subcategory : ChatGPT, Conversational AI, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Machine Learning. We enter on: Artificial Intelligence and check every content writer Click on each article Click on Follow, Clap article and leave a comment referring to the written article. Repeat this for all articles from this niche, then you can move on the subcategories: ChatGPT, Conversational AI, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Machine Learning. This way you will interact with about 100 content creators every day. In my experience of about 2 years on Medium 10% will subscribe to your page just because you followed that page and another 10% will subscribe because you interacted with their content. This will bring you a minimum of 20 followers every day which means that in less than 5 days you will reach 100 followers. You can continue with this advice up to 200, 300, 1000 followers and even more than that. Good luck!!!

That’s why we are launching the project We Are Collectors. Through this project, we aim to ask collectors questions that will help artists promote their artworks in the web3, connect with their target collectors and successfully promote themselves. This is just the beginning, many exciting interviews with collectors are coming. Don’t miss out on the latest updates — subscribe here and follow us on Mirror! Did we miss anything? Follow (We Are³) on Twitter and ask your question in the comments to the post and The Commodore will answer them later. The Commodore is not a very typical collector as he doesn’t just collect art. If you go to his Twitter page you may find a lot of interesting things: he curates meta exhibitions, the artists’ hubs and even creates his own AI-artworks… and so much more is planned. We talked on Twitter and discussed what and how he collects, how establishes the connections with artists, what’s his vision of web3 and its’ future. When did you start collecting NFTs? Probably some time around late 2020. Has the understanding of NFTs changed since that moment? Yes, quite significantly and it keeps evolving with the technology. What changed in your understanding comparing to 2020? I understand now that blockchain is a medium for information exchange. NFTs are nothing more than data wrappers. If so, do you think that such physical arts as, let’s say, performance, could become an NFT too and find its’ audience in web3? Absolutely, everything that is already digital today can be reproduced as an NFT which gives it additional capabilities. Physical-to-digital is a little more tricky as it requires trust in a 3rd-party for the physical custody of the tokenized asset. Why did you decide to collect art in web3? Why did you get interested in it? Because I witnessed the talent of the people immersed in it. That was something that jumped out of the ordinary which got my attention. Who were the artists that impressed you the most at that time? The artists I collect from ;) Do you remember what was the first NFT you bought? Why did you decide to buy specifically this work of specifically this artist? Do you still have this artwork? Don’t really remember which one it was… but I still hold almost all of my NFTs. I think there are many stories to be told and NFTs are the medium to prove you were there when everyone else was distracted. Why do you collect NFTs today? Is it for investments, establishing the emotional connection with the artist or you just like it? A little of everything, today I enjoy the process of collecting and curating digital art. I buy only what I like and never chase short-term price action. I can also explain why I bought every NFT I have. Is your collection just for yourself or do you have plans on its’ promotion , for instance, at the exhibitions? I’ve lots of plans for my collections. Curated VR galleries in OnCyber are one strategy that I’ve pursued this year. I’m looking forward to more formats to display the art and conduct exhibitions in the future. I’ve seen your exhibitions on OnCyber and this is a great way of the collection promotion! Why do you prefer OnCyber now? What other platforms you tested before or are testing now? I like OnCyber because I believe in their long-term vision of an Open Metaverse with a focus on artistic experiences. That being said, Ive also looked into other platforms like Substrata, Spatial, Decentraland, etc. as I believe there will be multiple winners in the metaverse race. Interoperability between blockchains will be key. Any plans to promote your collection out of web3 and maybe collaborate with physical galleries and the museums? If the opportunity arises, I’d love to showcase my collection(s) in physical galleries or museums. My hope is for these exhibitions to have a degree of interactiveness with the audience. Do you collect something specific? Or is it very random and more like «I like it-I buy it»? I collect and invest in people, not specific art per se. Now, you can get to know someone by buying their art. What do you collect? Art NFTs, music NFTs, something else? What is the main movement, style, medium, topic? My favorite NFTs are smart contract art and GIFs with narratives that support my vision of an Open Metaverse. Could you please tell a bit more about your interest to Open Metaverses? Do you think that artists should consider to be more present there? An Open Metaverse(s) is essential to a decentralized future of the Internet, as it will undepin most walled-garden gallery NFTs. Definitely artists should consider this option because of its freedom-to-create ethos and maximum reach. How do you search for artists? Twitter. Sure, but do you find the artists in spaces or communities? I think most of my findings today are the result of network effects. Twitter algorithm now seems to have enough depth to figure out what I like, so it’s easier today than say 1–2 years ago. I do have a standard selection criteria that I apply in my curation thought process, but I also like to bet on new/emerging talent. I understand collecting NFTs can become overwhelming if you are new to web3, but over time it becomes easier as you learn more about the intricacies of the crypto-art world. My advice for the new entrants is to collect only art you like and wouldn’t mind keeping for yourself. Stay safe and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it’s probably because it isn’t. How do you identify that this is the right artist, if we talk about investments? I look for technical excellence and social media skills (i.e. marketing). I try to understand their potential long term. What would be the sign for you that an artist has the long term potential? Do you mean here collaborations with the other artists, participation in the exhibitions and so on? Exhibition and/or any external recognition is highly desirable and always a positive sign. Collaboration makes sense only if the resulting art is somehow an interesting mix of styles and ideas or a project that drives innovation forward. Artistic inspiration, network influence, artistic style and social media presence are also important factors to be considered. IMPO, technical innovations will trump all of the above at the end (if successful). Few. Do you buy more directly from the artist or also at the secondary market? I prefer primary sales. Do you believe in the sales on secondary market in general? Generally speaking, yes. However, the incentive should be love for the art/collectible and not pure price speculation. So, you assemble your own collections of the artworks from different artists on OnCyber. What approach do you follow? I look for narratives that I believe are meaningful or follow similar patterns & structures. I really loved the Void Museum that you assembled. Could you please tell more about the concept? (I’m also a fan of Interstellar, so especially interested 🙂) Void Museum explores the concept of experiencing nothingness and everything at the same time, by collapsing all possibilities into a single dot of existence (a singularity). It’s a statement about order out of chaos. The other galleries — Commodore Plaza, Nightshade Underground, Zero Xway — are places in a map! There will me more info about those at a later time. Drilling down to the artistic level, what would you name as the main art movement in your collection? AI and Web3 History New AI tools arise everyday and today we can also use AI for the video generation. Would you pay your attention to the AI video art? Yes, however I’d encourage artists to try to stay ahead of AI capabilities, as I believe it’s in their best interest to exploit and nurture their own human creativity. Do you prefer buying established artists or do you focus on the new talents? I prefer to identify new talent. It’s more fun and rewarding. Top latest artists and artworks you have bought recently? This is the latest artist I bought an NFT from: @kevdwolf_ On which network do you buy NFTs? Only ETH? Mainly ETH and Tezos Do you consider, for example, Optimism network? Young artists start looking at it because of the lower gas and the fact that it’s built on ETH architecture. They hope to find there the collectors that mostly collect on ETH. I have collected some NFTs in Optimism and Base. These are novel promising blockchains, highly efficient and cheap to transact on. My issue with L2s is that at some point it becomes difficult to understand if there are duplicates in other chains, which goes against the value proposition of the scarcity argument. We need a standard, robust artist directory that can help address those concerns and provide clarity of the full x-chain artist portfolio. Like a Library Index or something… Would you buy the art on another network if you really like the artwork and the artist? Yes, but it would depend on the artist. If the artist you like uses new networks and platforms would you be ready to explore them? Yes, but I prefer if they use standard minting tools like Manifold. How do you see the development of NFT space? It’s a wild ride and it’s only getting started. Maybe you see now some trends that you believe will evolve? I believe there will be integration and interoperability with multiple 3D metaverses, proliferation of decentralized apps (ie dApps), AI-enabled tools with direct minting features, adoption in tradeable in-game NFTs, among other cool things. I expect lots of changes in the upcoming years, especially with regards to how we consume & interact with digital media. To wrap up, do you think it’s necessary to find another term to call NFTs? Like digital collectibles? What is your suggestion? No, but people need to stop assuming that because something is an NFT it must be valuable. NFTs are only wrappers of something else. Still have questions? Follow (We Are³) on Twitter and ask your question in the comments to the post and The Commodore will answer them later. "

Cryptocurrency trading signals can be based on several factors, including news, technical analysis, and the current market climate. A trader could unlock the door to substantial returns and improve their trading strategy with the right one. A trading signal service is researched by a group of Expert traders and analysts who make recommendations on buying, selling, and trading crypto to maximize profits. The best crypto signals are prevalent because their followers believe that they do most of the work for them. However, the crypto trader must manage their accounts and stay vigilant once they initiate trades. While you could check out a signal group and plug into it, you also should know how social trading works — to a certain extent. You also should ensure that your trades are being effectively managed and conduct proper risk management practices. Most crypto trading groups charge their members monthly access fees. Thus, you must carry out your due diligence before you make payments. The most significant benefit of signals is that they provide valuable trading data to their members. With the insights that they provide, you can effectively manage your assets. With signals, you learn how to stop losses, set targets, and the appropriate points to exit and enter a trade to maximize your profits. They provide more in-depth information than what you could get on the Internet or via analyses on social media. Telegram’s choice as the haven for crypto trading is primarily due to the density of the cryptocurrency trading community on the trading platform. It’s the best tool for broadcasting messages to a large audience. Telegram is more focused on privacy than other messenger apps. You can also use more messaging bots on the trading platform — better than what you can get on WhatsApp. Traders can take advantage of the RSS and automated bots to create broadcasts and share them with their group members. Usually, the most accurate crypto signal service will charge a fee before allowing you to join their channel. Of course, given their expertise and the importance of the information that they’re providing, it’s somewhat understandable that they’ll be looking to profit from it. However, some signal telegram groups allow free entry. Free options are good. They’re attractive because they allow you to save funds, but you might not get the level of accuracy that a paid signal provider gives. Keep in mind that some channel operators run a scammy joint. Some of them pay for advisory services, while others go online to steal signals that have been published elsewhere. The genuine providers offer quality insights and cover their costs by advertising on other popular channels. Your potential profits depend on how you trade, your capital distribution strategy, and how much you put in. Providers are great for a novice investor who doesn’t know much about cryptocurrency market dynamics, and they’ll provide an excellent way for you to learn the ropes. The signals will help you know what to buy, how to make an investment, and how to profit. As for your earnings, however, it isn’t easy to come to an estimate. Holistically, the signal group in the crypto space — both short-term and long-term are always up for question since they vary significantly. Regardless, one important thing that you’ll need to make money is the right knowledge — something signal operators offer.

https://medium.com/@subhashishc/i-uncovered-what-crypto-millionaires-are-buying-the-next-1000x-altcoins-554367b37480?source=read_next_recirc-----47465557e137----1---------------------fd614334_ef11_49dd_a266_e199cda82a3a-------,"I set out to uncover some of the top altcoins that millionaires and even crypto billionaires are buying. How did someone in 2018 when Bitcoin was less than $5,000 identify, spend $400 on this crypto, that less than three years later, would be worth over $4 million! They could have bought anything from Ethereum, a flat-screen TV, or even their very own water park. Was all of this a coincidence? or was there a secret to staying ahead of the markets that they knew that we did not. Today, we’ll be trying to find this truth by uncovering what many crypto millionaires are buying in this bear market. To do this, we are going to be going whale hunting, looking for clues that these large crypto investors or whales leave behind when they buy crypto projects. In the hopes of us finding crypto projects that could potentially 1000x come the next bull market. We’ll be using a combination of four different tools. But before uncovering what I found with these four tools, first we need to discuss why even do this in the first place. Let’s say there is an investor, Jeff, and he’s invested early in companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Facebook. Now, this would suggest that he probably has a good inside look at what companies to invest in early. So what if we could see what he was investing in before everyone else? Well, in traditional investing, that is near impossible. But with crypto and using the blockchain, we can see what these crypto millionaires using their wallet addresses are buying. And that’s because every transaction that’s ever been recorded is saved on the blockchain, but it’s not as simple as following every large crypto wallet address to find these hidden projects. Some large crypto-walled addresses aren’t active anymore, or others are actually of exchanges like Binance or Kucoin. We are looking for active investors who have at least several million dollars in crypto, and we can do this by using the first tool. First, we need to head over to a site like Coin Market Cap, and look up any crypto of your choosing. In this case, we’re going to be using Arbitrum, and that’s because it’s a fairly new crypto that just launched, which means that it’s likely to have more active users on this platform. From there, we can click on the contract address, and this is going to bring us to our first tool, the Block Explorer. Now, every crypto is going to be different, but all you have to do is click on the contract address, and it will take you to the appropriate one. Once on the Block Explorer, you can go to the holder’s tab and you can see every investor of this particular crypto from largest to smallest. But looking at large crypto wallet addresses for breadcrumbs is only part of the equation because remember we’re looking for actual investors that are active. But after looking, I found a wallet address that had $53,000 worth of Arbitrum. And right away, you can see this wallet is worth $1.5 million and has over a dozen different cryptos. However, we’re not done because we need to see exactly what they’re buying. And viewing wallet addresses portfolios inside of Block Explorers isn’t very easy to use and can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But we can paste this wallet address over in zapper.fi, the second tool. From here, we can get a nice breakdown of all the different cryptos that are in this portfolio along with exact amounts. Now, there are quite a few tokens inside of this wallet, but one, in particular, that I had not heard of before was that of Lyra, a decentralized protocol that has a market cap of $30 million. And what’s interesting here is that out of his entire $1.5 million portfolio, he only has $7,800 in this project, which may sound like a lot, but to put this in perspective, it would be like having $1,000 total to invest in crypto and only putting in $5 into a project. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. But let’s move on to another wallet. Now, this wallet had $57,000 worth of Arbitrum and a little over a million dollars in total across the different projects it’s in. Now, a crypto protocol that caught my eye was that of Vela Exchange, which is a hybrid exchange on the Arbitrum ecosystem, and they have over $30,000 worth of this token, which is over 3% of their entire portfolio. So this is significantly higher than the other project that we looked at compared to the last portfolio. But this entire process is very time-consuming, and there’s actually software that will do all of this heavy lifting for us. And this brings us to tool number three, whalestats.com. This tool pulls together top whales and lets us not only see what the wealthiest people are buying but also gives us an entire breakdown of their portfolio. So when looking at the top wallets on the platform right away, you can see a wallet that’s valued at over 44 billion. But the wallet that caught my attention had over half a billion dollars in it and over a hundred different tokens. And this is where I wanted to start my search. Now, right away, the most noteworthy part about this portfolio is that they have over $300 million in Shiba Inu. Now, this sounds crazy, but since the launch price of Shiba Inu has increased by over 15,000,000%, they could have actually gotten that $300 million from investing as little as $1,500 bucks. But I believe Shiba Inu has had its day for these types of returns. So I wanted to look at some smaller projects inside of the list. Moving down, you can see that he has over $12 million of incoming crypto transactions, one of the top being $7 million worth of Matic. And I think Polygon Matic is a great layer two with a lot of functionality, but there’s no way that project is going to 100x anytime soon. And to do so, it would have to increase by over $900 billion, which is almost the entire net worth of crypto as a whole right now. Moving on to some of the smaller tokens, it gets a bit more interesting. Now, he has some common metaverse projects such as Sand and Mana, but one project, in particular, that caught my eye was Fetch.ai, and he has $5 million worth. Now, this is an artificial intelligence project, and the thing is with these AI crypto projects is I’m just not sure if I’m sold on them as a whole. Yes, AI does have some use cases, but it seems like these crypto projects know that if they throw AI anywhere inside their protocol, people will come to it almost as if it’s like a marketing service. Now that being said, he does own $5 million worth of this crypto, but once again, $5 million to him would be the equivalent of if you had a thousand dollars to invest in crypto only putting in $10 into this project. So still very small amounts here, but there’s one tool that I may even like a bit better than Whale Tracker, and that’s Whale Trades. It does a combination of what the three other tools previously do except it shows live trades from about 15 major exchanges. Using this tool, I found a crypto wallet that has about $3.5 million worth of altcoins. Now, what’s interesting about this wallet is that they have over 40 different projects. Now, their top position is Sand, which is worth a little over $300,000, and that’s already on my watch list. Now moving down, you can see that they have some more familiar tokens such as Ethereum, Matic, Fantom, Mana, and I was familiar with a lot of these projects on the list until I got down into one, in particular, which is the KNS token or Kyber network, which is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum, and it’s retraced by almost 90% with a market cap of over a hundred million dollars. So this is definitely a smaller project, and I added it to my watch list. Now, one more small altcoin that I found in this portfolio was Synapse. And this protocol specifically focuses on crypto bridging, and this helps facilitate transactions between large cryptocurrency projects. Now, I do have some other projects inside of my portfolio already that do have some type of bridge component, but I don’t have one that is solely focused on bridging as a whole. So I went ahead and added this one to my watch list, and the fact that it’s at a 150 million market cap, and that may sound like a lot, but it’s peanuts really compared to middle and big caps. But what I’m doing not only with this crypto wallet address but other ones that I come across in my research is: But out of these projects, which ones did I actually pull the trigger on to add to my portfolio? Well, the answer to that is none of them right now because I think that more important than the actual cryptos I mentioned is the method in which I used to find them. Because none of these cryptos may take off. Some of them may, some of them may not, but one of them will, and I will find that by continually using this method. The tools mentioned in this blog, including Coin Market Cap, Block Explorers, Zapper.fi, Whalestats.com, and staying updated on social media and news platforms, can aid in discovering altcoins that are attracting the attention of wealthy investors. However, remember that investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks, and it’s crucial to make informed decisions based on your own research and risk tolerance.

It’s crucial to keep in mind that we are still in a bear market, even though major cryptocurrencies have recently had some upward momentum.

We’ll highlight the top five coins to buy in November in this article. While you’re here, Join our Telegram Channel where you can find FREE reliable crypto signals! Bitcoin (BTC) Since mid-October, Bitcoin has exhibited a robust upward trend, topping $34,000 and registering a noteworthy 26.8% monthly increase — its greatest since January’s roughly 39.6% surge. On its price chart, Bitcoin has created a triangle pattern over the last seven days, with resistance at $35,000 and support at $33,000. These patterns usually indicate that a continuous uptrend is pausing for consolidation before to a possible surge higher. If the price of bitcoin rises above $35,000, it may extend the rally that started at $26,500 and head for the $40,000 mark. According to the most recent data, the price of Bitcoin is $34,332, down 0.95% over the last day. Triangle patterns frequently indicate an uptrend continuance, but they can also break lower, suggesting that the rise may be coming to an end. For this reason, investors should keep a close eye on the price of $BTC in the next days. While you’re here, Join our Telegram Channel where you can find FREE reliable crypto signals! Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX): In its ongoing presale, Bitcoin Minetrix has surpassed $2.8 million, marking a noteworthy milestone. The remarkable presale performance indicates the high level of interest in Bitcoin Minetrix’s ground-breaking ‘Stake-to-Mine’ idea, which aims to enable anyone to mine Bitcoins. Tokenized cloud mining credits are provided by Bitcoin Minetrix using the native cryptocurrency, $BTCMTX. At $0.0113 per token, interested investors can purchase $BTCMTX tokens during the current presale phase. An Ethereum-based smart contract enables $BTCMTX staking to start right away after purchase, giving investors the opportunity to earn passive income. As of this writing, 204% APY is available for staking on Bitcoin Minetrix. Holders of staked tokens can also gain credits for cloud mining. Tokenizing these credits improves user security and transparency. These credits can be used to purchase mining power for Bitcoin within the ecosystem, giving you access to allotted mining time and a cut of the profits from your efforts. This strategy makes cloud mining more accessible, especially to people who don’t have any prior mining expertise or knowledge. There are four billion tokens available for the $BTCMTX, of which 2.8 billion are distributed over the course of twenty presale rounds. While you’re here, Join our Telegram Channel where you can find FREE reliable crypto signals! Solana, or SOL At roughly $36.36, $SOL is trading with a bullish trend that doesn’t seem to be abating. Because of Solana’s increasing prominence in the blockchain industry, there are those who think that if this trend keeps up, $SOL may hit $50 in the next few weeks and close the gap with Ethereum over the course of the next several years. All major time frames show that $SOL is still in a strong uptrend. A strong support zone between $31 and $32 indicates that the price will continue to rise unless there is a large market correction. A $50 rise, or a 36% increase, is further supported by strong on-chain metrics and increasing developer engagement. Given these elements, Solana’s overall outlook is still quite positive, which makes now an excellent time to hold $SOL.

Kombat Memes (MK) Meme Kombat is a special kind of token that combines the stake-to-earn feature with the amazing growth potential of meme currencies. Meme Kombat is unique in that it uses blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to create a battle arena where users can gamble. Over $950K has been successfully raised for the project. In addition to earning token rewards, players can compete by matching meme tokens against one another in player versus player (PvP) and player versus game (PvG) modes. Players are able to place side bets and wagers during battles since this fighting arena is protected by blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, which guarantees that the results are fair, transparent, secure, and unchangeable. A seasonal approach to gaming is described in the Meme Kombat roadmap, which also includes new game modes, awards, combat kinds, and other battle arena extensions. Presale participants are already benefiting from an APY of 112% on the $MK tokens they purchased during this round, as the presale is presently in progress. During the presale, 50% (60 million) of the 12 million token total supply of $MK will be offered at a price of $0.1667, with a $10 million hard cap. Ten percent of the supply is set aside for DEX liquidity, while the remaining thirty percent is divided between staking and fight prizes. The remaining ten percent goes towards community benefits, which include engagement-related incentives like content production, recommendations, enduring loyalty, and cooperative expansion.

After that, the coin’s value dropped to almost an all-time low as the market steadied. With $80.38 million in 24-hour trading volume, Sei’s value is currently $0.10, down -3.51% from the previous day. It is possible that by year’s end, $SEI will have reached $0.11. Sei’s price is influenced by a number of crypto market variables. Hard forks and protocol changes are two examples of events that might drastically affect Sei’s price. From its founding, Sei has demonstrated significant growth and has been introducing technological advancements on a regular basis. The $SEI Token has a good possibility of recovering its previous position should the market improve. While you’re here, Join our Telegram Channel where you can find FREE reliable crypto signals! In summary Even while Bitcoin is still a simple choice in the current market, it is not a good idea to limit a portfolio to just one asset. The cryptocurrency market is expecting a number of optimistic phases in response to the impending halving of Bitcoin. During bullish periods, well-established cryptocurrency assets usually appreciate and follow market trends. They are unable to imitate the erratic price swings of developing assets, though. New assets can yield rewards for early adopters of 5x to 500x due to their low market capitalization and significant growth potential.

Today, we’re going to take a closer look at this historic cryptocurrency that has played a significant role in shaping the current cryptocurrency landscape. Cardano is the name, and we will attempt to answer whether it’s worth considering as an investment option. First and foremost, let’s clarify that none of the information presented here constitutes financial advice. It’s essential to conduct your research and make informed decisions. With that in mind, let’s dive into Cardano. To put Cardano’s current state into context, let’s take a trip down memory lane to June 29th, 2021. At that time, Bitcoin was valued at $35,000, Ethereum at $2,130, and Cardano was the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $43 billion. Before the last bull cycle, Cardano was considered a giant in the crypto space. However, as of today, it seems to have lost some of that strength. Several factors have contributed to this shift. Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has increased, leading to a more significant focus on Bitcoin and fewer opportunities for altcoins. Cardano has slipped to the eighth position in terms of market capitalization. It’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and various developments and legal issues can impact a coin’s ranking and performance. XRP, for instance, managed to win a significant legal case, leading to a surge in its value. Additionally, Solana has been making a comeback. Solana’s unique ecosystem, built using the Rust coding language, has enabled innovative applications and attracted a substantial user base. Now, let’s turn our attention back to Cardano and its current market situation. Cardano currently boasts a market cap of $10 billion, a significant decrease from its previous high. To determine… "

https://medium.com/@BlockbaseInvestments/from-humble-kid-to-billionaire-cz-challenges-the-status-quo-0d536ffe5db7,"Binance, the largest player in the cryptocurrency exchange world, is currently embroiled in a significant legal conflict with a principal regulator from Wall Street. This clash might set a precedent for the future of the crypto sector. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Binance, led by Changpeng Zhao, who once worked in a burger joint and is now a billionaire, with various offenses. The core allegations are related to deceiving investors and operating an illegal exchange. Changpeng Zhao, or “CZ”, the company’s leader, is said to have devised a complex strategy to bypass U.S. securities regulations. These accusations against Binance are part of a larger campaign by the SEC to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto space, especially after the collapse of FTX. Recently, the SEC has also targeted other major players like Coinbase. Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, has voiced concerns about the lack of protective measures for investors in the crypto world, likening it to the “Wild West”. The SEC, under Gensler’s leadership, asserts that most digital currencies should be treated like stocks, a view that challenges the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. Binance, with its 140 million global users, is more than just a crypto exchange. Yesha Yadav, a digital asset specialist, emphasizes Binance’s pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. The platform not only allows trading but also has research, lending, and other financial features, making it a comprehensive financial hub in the crypto world. The SEC believes some of Binance’s business practices aren’t transparent and that the company has its own digital coin, the Binance Coin. The current standoff between the SEC and Binance was foreseeable for many experts. Gensler’s aim has been to bring the crypto sector into regulatory light. With significant expertise in the field, he believes that old securities laws can govern this nascent industry. Under Gensler’s direction, the SEC has pursued multiple legal actions against crypto organizations. These companies, in turn, are determined to resist such regulatory oversight. From humble backgrounds to Crypto Billionaire Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder, has become an iconic figure in the crypto community. Although he started humbly, he now stands as a prominent business leader with Binance, a company he established in 2017 in China. The SEC views Binance’s operations as complex and elusive, mostly controlled by CZ. However, CZ challenges these perceptions, often confronting critics on platforms like the one previously named Twitter. While he’s seen as an inspirational figure in the crypto world, the SEC regards him with skepticism. CZ’s journey from flipping burgers to creating Binance is emblematic of the allure of the crypto world. He fully embraced cryptocurrencies after learning about them in 2013, even selling all his assets to invest. This bold move, though initially disastrous, paid off as he identified a market gap and introduced Binance. Despite its rapid success, Binance has faced various controversies, from alleged facilitation of illicit transactions to rumored affiliations with China. Currently, the SEC’s lawsuit poses the most significant threat to Binance. The company is facing challenges on multiple fronts, from decreasing market share in the U.S. to scrutiny from various countries and a reported investigation by the Department of Justice. While Binance intends to challenge the SEC’s accusations, CZ has expressed that he isn’t entirely against regulation. The core of the debate now revolves around the kind and extent of regulatory measures appropriate for the crypto domain, and this lawsuit may well decide the course. Investors’ safety and Innovation are not mutually exclusive The crypto industry has come a long way, showing remarkable resilience, adaptability, and growth over the years. Its transformative potential is being recognized globally, as evidenced by Binance’s vast user base and prominent role in the sector. The ongoing lawsuit between Binance and the SEC is not just a solitary skirmish, but rather a pivotal moment that will guide the future course of the entire crypto domain. Binance’s stand in this legal battle is symbolic of the crypto community’s desire for freedom, innovation, and decentralization. There’s a palpable sense of optimism in the air as stakeholders across the industry believe that, even amidst regulatory challenges, the inherent strengths and benefits of blockchain technology will shine through. With the blending of traditional and crypto financial systems, there’s an unprecedented opportunity for synergy. Regulatory challenges, though perceived as hurdles, could become the building blocks of a robust, harmonized, and globally accepted crypto infrastructure. Should the SEC and Binance find common ground, it might set a cooperative precedent, sending a positive signal to regulatory bodies worldwide. Such a development could accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. CZ’s journey from flipping burgers to leading one of the most influential crypto exchanges is a testament to the limitless opportunities the crypto space offers. His dedication to Binance underscores the broader industry’s commitment to revolutionizing the way we perceive and handle finance. With the world watching, this Binance-SEC episode has the potential to become a landmark event that fosters understanding, collaboration, and growth. The hope is for an outcome where innovation thrives, investors are safeguarded, and the revolutionary spirit of crypto remains undiminished. This may very well be the dawn of a new era where crypto takes its rightful place as a cornerstone of the global financial ecosystem. "
https://medium.com/@BlockbaseInvestments/is-now-the-best-time-to-invest-in-bitcoin-crypto-56731f70c5b1,"Bitcoin’s journey has been a rollercoaster of dramatic Highs and Lows since its inception. Is it prudent to invest in cryptocurrency right now? On the exterior, the present seems an uncertain time to venture into the preeminent digital currency. However, the subtle nuances paint a different picture. Despite a seeming decline in public interest, Bitcoin has remarkably bounced back in value over recent months, escalating from US$16,000 in December 2022 to a substantial figure over US$34,000 presently. But can we anticipate a continuation of this upward trend, or is there a looming descent in Bitcoin’s value on the horizon? Investment in Bitcoin is fraught with complexities and demands a nuanced understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape. Very quickly this guide will navigate you through the essentials. Bitcoin birthed by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, pioneered the cryptocurrency movement, operating on a robust foundation of blockchain technology which ensures transaction validation and security. It uses a sophisticated process of validation called proof of work or Bitcoin mining, which is central to the generation of new Bitcoins. Investing in Bitcoin encompasses various considerations, ranging from supply and demand dynamics to regulatory influences. A capped supply of 21 million Bitcoins coupled with production intricacies and competition from other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, underscores the volatility and speculative nature of Bitcoin investment. Government regulations and public interest further influence its value. Bitcoin’s valuation has seen fluctuations, with its value currently hovering around US$31,000, a remarkable recovery from previous lows but still shy of its peak valuations. Expert opinions on its future trajectory range from highly optimistic forecasts of monumental growth to more cautious, moderate projections and some skepticism regarding its long-term viability. Navigating the investment pathways in Bitcoin requires a blend of strategic acumen and practical knowledge. Understanding the intricacies of exchanges, wallets, and transaction processes is essential. A prudent investment approach necessitates a balanced portfolio, underpinned by comprehensive research and cybersecurity safeguards. Bitcoin stands as a formidable entity in the investment arena, embodying both speculative potential and inherent volatility. Current market dynamics present a conducive environment for potential investors, but it is imperative to tread with caution, cognizant of the risks and uncertainties that pervade the cryptocurrency landscape. Investing in Bitcoin embodies a venture into a realm of profound potential, intertwined with complexities and risks. Thus, any investment decision should be made with a discerning eye and a well-strategized approach. Rebellion Protocol is pioneering as the first Crypto Venture Capital fund entirely fueled by the community and which embodies systemic exponential growth features. Our mission, is to build a project with the kind of systemic growth that generates ripple effect through its entire ecosystem, that is self-enhancing and exponential, and therein displays overwhelming momentum and moves with unstoppable force. The project employs NFT governance tokens, or DAO NFTs, which grant holders the ability to propose investments and vote on where the funds in the investment wallet should be allocated. This distinctive method enables the community to share in the profits generated from successful investments.

https://medium.com/@BlockbaseInvestments/i-followed-5-crypto-millionaires-heres-how-to-become-like-them-b80d80260bab,"It may seem obvious, but not enough people talk to people with insider knowledge in the cryptocurrency world when making investment decisions, according to an interviewed investor. While popular YouTube channels like Coin Bureau, Altcoin Daily and Brain Jung are helpful for ramping up basic crypto knowledge and understanding trends, they tend to focus on big projects with limited upside potential. While following their recommendations can still lead to significant long-term profits, it’s unlikely to uncover life-changing hidden gems with 1000x potential. To find moonshot crypto investments with 50x-100x or even 1000x potential, investors should spend a majority of their time in chat rooms where knowledgeable investors and insiders share hot and upcoming projects. Platforms like Telegram and Discord are great for finding these “insider” chats, where members often discuss lesser-known projects with significant growth potential. It’s important to observe the recommendations of different chat members and monitor their success rates before investing with them. Asking questions, participating in discussions, and sharing your own recommendations can also build visibility and credibility in these communities. Some good chats to start with include Jacob Bury Discord, ICO Analytics Telegram, and Crypto Inner Circle Telegram, but these are still very main stream, so make some friends and dig deeper. I will not spoil you the pleasure of finding secret chat rooms that only a few will know and that will give you the best insider opportunities. Keep in mind that some groups may require a monthly fee or holding their own token. It can be worth the investment, as you can typically find low cap projects with huge potential, such as Rebellion Protocol in these chats. But be careful to ask for references and analyze historical performance before you pay to join anything. In addition, it’s essential to do your own research before investing in any project. Bad projects can circulate in chat rooms just as easily as they do elsewhere. If you’re not sure how to identify good projects, there are plenty of videos on YouTube that can help. Successful investors often follow other successful investors who in turn follow other successful investors. These individuals tend to associate with one another and keep an eye on each other’s actions. One effective technique recommended by some successful investors is to monitor the on-chain movements of whale accounts and emulate their investment decisions. Fortunately, transactions on main blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and Polkadot (and others) are public, making it easy to identify successful wallets/accounts, and track their transactions via the blockchain’s explorer, respectively https://etherscan.io, https://explorer.solana.com, https://atomscan.com and https://explorer.polkascan.io/polkadot. Seek wallets that are owned by whales with balances ranging from USD 1M to several millions. It is recommended to follow different wallet sizes, but it’s important to note that replicating a whale’s investment strategy may not be suitable for everyone due to the volume of projects they invest in and their execution speed. As a strategy, you can analyze wallets that invested in a project before it became successful and investigate if these wallets consistently bet on successful projects over the past 3–6 months. Then, start monitoring their moves and mimic investments that make sense for you. As usual, it’s important to conduct your own research before investing. This method works best for tokens traded on decentralized exchanges for low cap high-potential gems. There are several tools available to monitor addresses, such as a free Cryptocurrency Alerting bot, Dune or Nansen, which are powerful monitoring and analytics tool. Paid version can be expensive though. Additionally, there are blockchain analytics software that can help monitor on-chain moves. If you’re unfamiliar with navigating blockchain explorers or conducting on-chain analysis, there are numerous videos on YouTube that can guide you through the process. Here is a great article on on-chain analytics. As an investor, you can’t possibly keep track of every potential investment opportunity in the crypto market. That’s why using crypto launchpads can be a great way to discover promising projects that are still in the early stages. Launchpads seek out these projects and raise money for them, typically between USD 50k to USD 500K, before listing their tokens on decentralized exchanges. Investors can participate in these investment rounds by providing initial liquidity in exchange for a percentage of the project’s token supply. However, to participate, investors must meet certain requirements, such as owning a certain amount of the launchpad’s token or being whitelisted for each investment round. One of the major benefits of using launchpads is that they have vetting processes in place to filter out scam projects and rug-pulls. Launchpads like Polkastarter, Bounce and Red Kite have been around for a while, while newer ones like Solster and Boostx are also emerging. By using launchpads, investors can potentially discover promising projects before they hit the mainstream market and avoid scams at the same time. Keep in mind, that much more projects launch in bullish trends, you may have to wait a bit before seeing massive amounts of new projects being launched on pads. This is a base rule in investment; Don’t put all your eggs in the same basket, i.e. diversify your investments, especially when investing in low cap projects. The level of diversification suitable for you depends on your investment amount and risk profile. Generally, more diversification reduces the risk related to a single project, but it also reduces the impact of a single project on your overall portfolio. It’s important to choose the correct diversification strategy for you. Investing in too many projects can be overwhelming and limit your upside potential, while investing in only one project lacks diversification and relies solely on that project’s success. As a guide, it’s recommended to allocate: It’s essential to keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency is highly risky, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose. This article is not financial advice, and it’s crucial to conduct your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency projects. Finally, if you found this article helpful, please give it at least a dozen claps for good luck.

https://medium.com/@cryptonicaed/top-5-artificial-intelligence-ai-cryptocurrencies-e535e29b9040,"AI cryptocurrencies are a type of cryptocurrencies that combine artificial intelligence mechanisms. It is a combination of blockchain technology and AI to create powerful tools. The interaction between artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies could transform the financial industry. For example, AI can be used to automate the process of analyzing large amounts of data, such as market trends, news, and sentiment in the crypto market. This optimization will help investors improve their strategies and potentially increase their earnings. In addition, thanks to AI, investors will better understand and assess their risks. AI can analyze historical price movement data, trading volumes, and other relevant factors to create a price prediction model. AI algorithms can also review transactions and identify suspicious behavior to help prevent fraud and improve security. Speaking of safety, AI is able to automate and make more accurate compliance checks, such as KYC and AML procedures. AI might also improve and empower smart contracts. And these are just a few of the possible directions. Injective Protocol is a Cosmos-based protocol that acts as a decentralized exchange. Unlike its competitors, it does not use the model of automated market makers. Instead, the Injective Protocol seeks to combine the efficiency of traditional finance with the transparency of decentralized exchanges by using the classic order book model. Users pay fees using the native token INJ, which is also needed for management, staking, and more. The protocol uses artificial intelligence to automate trading and provide security, which is why it is so well-designed for beginners. The Graph (GRT) is a protocol that allows developers to create and query data from various blockchains, including Ethereum, in a more efficient and standardized way. The goal of the protocol is to help developers use relevant data to improve the efficiency of their decentralized applications. The GRT token is the link in the operation of the protocol. Any user, whether an indexer, curator, or delegator, must stake GRT to perform their functions, and in return receive a reward from the network. A protocol that utilizes AI in its operation makes indexing and querying blockchain data more efficient, saving developers time and money. Render Network is powered by blockchain and specializes in animation, motion graphics, and other video effects. Render’s goal is to create a decentralized network that allows artists and content creators to efficiently use rendering power and resources and allows people with free computing resources to earn rewards by contributing their computing power to the network. AI ensures the highest quality of work and also optimizes the rendering process. The RNDR token acts as the native cryptocurrency of the Render network. It is used to pay for rendering services and as an incentive for users who provide their computing resources for rendering. Oasis Network (ROSE) is a blockchain platform focused on data privacy and security. The protocol allows developers to create dApps that can work with confidential data while maintaining privacy. The network is able to compute data without compromising its privacy by utilizing MPC technology. Oasis Network is also able to handle a huge number of transactions. With the ROSE native token, users gain access to a more secure and private ecosystem. The token is also needed for network management, transaction staking, and payment. AI is used to strengthen network security and improve transaction efficiency. inSure DeFi (SURE) is a blockchain-based project focused on insurance solutions for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The project aims to provide risk mitigation and insurance coverage for users of DeFi and smart contract platforms. AI is used in various aspects of risk assessment and data analytics in the insurance industry to help effectively protect investors from losses resulting from vulnerabilities, hacks, exploits, and other unforeseen events in the DeFi ecosystem. SURE is the inSure DeFi platform’s native cryptocurrency. It is used for a variety of purposes within the ecosystem, including staking, governance, and as a means of participating in the insurance and risk-sharing process. Whether AI cryptocurrencies are a good investment depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment strategy, and your understanding of a particular AI cryptocurrency project.However, many crypto market experts predict AI cryptocurrencies to grow to $1 billion by 2030 due to the rapid adaptation of artificial intelligence. Some cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects are actively using or incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into their platforms or applications. These projects also use native tokens on the blockchain for their operations. SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol are just a few of them. The best AI cryptocurrency will be different for every investor, but at the time of writing, the best cryptocurrency in the AI sector by market capitalization is Injective (INJ). It has a market capitalization of $1.151 billion. The future of AI cryptocurrencies, like any other emerging technology, is subject to many factors and uncertainties. For example, technological advances, regulation, market acceptance, and use cases, as well as the competition, community, and team of a particular project. Our review of the best AI cryptocurrencies shows how deeply artificial intelligence technologies have been implemented and how they can interact with the blockchain world. Artificial intelligence not only automates the operation of crypto projects but also provides new and unique investment opportunities. However, as with any cryptocurrency, investors need to do their own research before purchasing a particular AI token. What are the projects in Crypto AI you may recommend to others?

https://medium.com/@iampaulrose/a-new-ai-side-hustle-everyone-should-try-9538abaf6817,"Even though it sounds cliche, AI is like the gold rush of our time. When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly. Etsy is another marketplace and probably the best for selling your AI prompts. They get more than 454 million visitors every month, and these are all potential buyers for your products. Now, If you’ve ever tried selling on Etsy and made no sales, it’s probably one of two things But that won’t be the case for our AI prompts. Because Plus, it’s so obvious that the demand is there. So you can sell AI prompts on Etsy to make passive income. In fact, some people were smart enough to get in on this very early and are already making thousands of dollars. For a clear picture of how much you can make with this side hustle, I found 2 Etsy shops selling their AI prompts. First, we have purrfect city, And at an average price of $3.43 per prompt, this shop has made well over $9,312 passively. I also found a shop called Guide pro And at an average price of $4.99 per prompt pack, this shop has made $9,585 in passive income. My point is, AI isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay. You either adapt or get left behind. And Prompting is one of the best skills you can learn in this day and age. So if you’ve been looking for a way to get a piece of the AI pie, here’s your chance. Start your AI prompt shop today. Remember, Midjourney is just one of the AI tools you could be creating prompts for. The Prompting Class I showed you guys is for Midjourney & Midjourney is not free. It costs $10 per month but I believe it’s worth it. Once you learn how to create these prompts, you can launch your own prompt shop, or even take this side hustle one step further. Use your prompting skills to make money in various other ways. For example, you can So you learn the skill once and you’ll keep making money from your knowledge. So consider this side hustle and start improving your AI prompting skills on YouTube or with Ken Bluttman’s AI art Prompting Class.

https://medium.com/cryptocurrencies-ups-and-down/stablecoin-arbitrage-liquidity-pools-automated-market-makers-c20153160032,"A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to another asset, often a fiat currency like the US dollar. For example, Tether (USDT) is a popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins have become a popular cryptocurrency investment as they provide stability relative to other crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). Arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of an asset in different markets to lock in a profit. This profit is derived from market inefficiency due to price differences between exchanges. Application of arbitrage in the stablecoin market requires a trader to simultaneously buy in one exchange and sell on another when there are price discrepancies between exchanges. Liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMM) play an important role in the stability of the stablecoin market. Liquidity pools are self-balancing pools of tokens held by traders. This allows for automatic stabilization for any sudden influx of buying or selling orders. Automated market makers (AMM) are decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols used to create markets and incentivize trading. The built-in price discovery and smart contracts enable traders to trade tokens and improve liquidity in the stablecoin market efficiently. Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: Fiat-backed stablecoins are digital assets that are pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency such as the US dollar, euro, or yen. Each coin is backed by physical currency held in a reserve and each coin is exchangeable for its underlying asset. These stablecoins offer the stability of a fiat currency while allowing users to transact on a blockchain. Advantages of Fiat-backed Stablecoins include low volatility, lack of counterparty risk, transparency, low fees, and ease of use. Disadvantages include the need for users to trust the legitimacy of the reserve and the backing of the coin. Crypto-Backed Stablecoins: Crypto-backed stablecoins are digital tokens that are backed by another cryptocurrency reserve. These digital tokens are based on the value of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether and are used to create a… "

If you want to earn money you need to be consistent and be active every day, at least in the beginning. So my advice is to choose a niche that you are passionate about because otherwise after the first couple of months of earning 2–3$ you will decide to quit. Even on holidays I would take my laptop and after lunch I would go to the beach and start writing an article. You can’t do this unless you do it with passion. After choosing your niche go to Medium.Com and you have on the right side Recommended topic and click on See more topics. For example we will chose niche Artificial Intellingence with subcategory : ChatGPT, Conversational AI, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Machine Learning. We enter on: Artificial Intelligence and check every content writer Click on each article Click on Follow, Clap article and leave a comment referring to the written article. Repeat this for all articles from this niche, then you can move on the subcategories: ChatGPT, Conversational AI, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Machine Learning. This way you will interact with about 100 content creators every day. In my experience of about 2 years on Medium 10% will subscribe to your page just because you followed that page and another 10% will subscribe because you interacted with their content. This will bring you a minimum of 20 followers every day which means that in less than 5 days you will reach 100 followers.

In zkSync, computation is performed off-chain, and most data is stored off-chain as well. As all transactions are proven on the Ethereum mainchain, users enjoy the same security level as in Ethereum. zkSync is designed to look and feel like Ethereum but with lower fees. Just like on Ethereum, smart contracts are written in Solidity/Vyper and can be called using the same clients as other EVM-compatible chains. zkSync stands out remarkably in security and usability among existing L2 scaling solutions. Thanks to the combination of cutting-edge cryptography and on-chain data availability, ZK rollups (the core network of zkSync) are the only L2 scaling solution that doesn’t require any operational activity to keep the funds safe. For example, users can go offline and still be able to withdraw their assets safely when they come back, even if the ZK rollup validators are no longer around. Matter Labs has raised $458 million, including a $200 million ecosystem fund to foster zkSync adoption. The project’s investors include major funds: Blockchain Capital, Dragonfly, a16z, Bit DAO, Consensys, and others. Read more here: https://cryptorank.io/ico/zksync Like many other major companies, zkSync is not revealing any details about their future token. At the same time, we are almost 100% sure that it will appear. The main issue is the distribution of the future token. And here the options may be different, but the chance that zkSync will hold an Airdrop is also quite high. So far, this distribution model is the most successful in terms of user loyalty. At the conference in Warsaw, we talked to a representative of the campaign, and it was indirectly confirmed that the project will have its own token. However, nobody answered the question of distribution. 👉 Official links: Website | Discord | Twitter | Docs This step is crucial for enhancing your anonymity when using multi-accounts. For cost-saving, we recommend choosing OKX. Additionally, using the official bridge at least once can often enhance your chances for the Airdrop. Interaction with smart contracts is a crucial criterion for many airdrops. By minting all collections, you will engage in 4 transactions and interact with 4 smart contracts. We highly recommend conducting transactions regularly to increase your eligibility, such as every week. More collections and on other networks can be found on the website: To reduce gas and fees in the zkSync network, click on Edit during transaction submission and reduce the Gas limit. Change the first digit to 1 This might extend the transaction time but will save you money. We recommend mint every NFT on the website in the same way. Once the entire collection is sold out, the NFTs are just as likely to rise in value. Keep that in mind. Don’t forget to manually reduce the amount of gas. Each swap will cost ~$0.4 You can put some of your tokens into the liquidity pool on this platform. If you already have USDC and BUSD, add liquidity to this pair: Interact with other dApps similarly. Make swaps, add liquidity, and remember that consistency in your actions is crucial. Each platform doesn’t have its own token, so there is a chance that we will also get rewards for being active in these dApps. Visit the website and choose any domain name you want. Domains longer than 5 characters cost 0.0031 ETH + gas. Not a bad opportunity to get a future Airdrop in native form. In fact, the project itself will show you the activities that need to be performed, but not all of them will be optimal in terms of costs. Just complete all the quests offered.

I’m thrilled to share some exciting news from the world of Arbitrum with you. There’s been some recent development in the Arbitrum ecosystem that has caught my attention, and it involves a significant opportunity. It appears that a staggering 69 million unclaimed $ARB tokens from the previous Arbitrum airdrop have made their way back to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. You can verify this in the tweet screenshot provided below. While Arbitrum has officially denied any plans for an Arbitrum Airdrop 2.0, I’ve discovered some compelling reasons to believe that these unclaimed 69 million $ARB tokens will be utilized in the Arbitrum Short-term Incentive Program. This program received overwhelming support through a community vote on their snapshot page. In this article, I’ll delve into why you should take this development seriously and how you can position yourself to participate in this second-phase Arbitrum Airdrop. But before we dive into that, let’s take note of some important dates: 2. On September 11, Arbitrum DAO proposed a new incentive program known as the “Arbitrum Short-term Incentive Program,” and it successfully passed. 3. Then, on September 19, Arbitrum announced the return of Arbitrum Odyssey. It’s worth noting that despite their official denials of a second Airdrop (as shown in the screenshot above), I, your trusted source Jadeofwallstreet, have been in this game long enough to see through their usual tactics.

And guess what? We’re just getting started. Brace yourselves, because today we’re dropping some news that’s been brewing behind the scenes for a while now! Since July, we have been in extensive discussions with Telos Foundation. Through numerous collaborative talks, we have felt the Foundation’s strong commitment to supporting protocols and their robust drive to grow the DeFi ecosystem! We are delighted to introduce you to another fantastic EVM-compatible chain and its ecosystem, Telos, backed by the strong support of the Telos Foundation. Thanks to the grant support from Telos Foundation, our expansion into this new ecosystem offers substantial benefits to our existing community and will be bootstrapped with various exciting events. Here’s a brief overview: Stay in the loop — there’s plenty brewing with Velocore and the Telos Foundation. We’re cooking up a host of events and announcements that our community members will surely love. With so much unfolding, you’re going to want to join us for every step of this exciting journey. The official launch of Velocore V2 on Telos, along with the start of emissions, is slated for November 14th at 3 AM UTC. To facilitate a smooth bridging experience and to help the community prepare for the launch, the front-end will be made available in advance. In celebration of the launch on Telos, we will be airdropping our new $veTVC tokens to our users on existing ecosystems. The eligibility for the airdrop and the total allocation of $veTVC will be determined based on the passport scores from zkSyncEra and Linea, ensuring a fair distribution. Users will be able to claim their airdrop through the Telos airdrop claim page, which will be provided at a later date. We’ll be showing a button on the TELOS page to check the quantity you’re entitled to soon, this week. Stay tuned for the next announcement! At launch, 30% of the airdrop amount will be immediately claimable, while the remaining 70% will be subject to a 2-month linear vesting period. This approach balances immediate rewards with a commitment to the longevity of the protocol. Velocore V2 on Telos inherits the robust tokenomics of its predecessor while incorporating improvements centered around the user. The adjustments include: The initial supply of $TVC is set at 750,000 and $veTVC is set at 5,250,000. For the existing Velocore users, an allocation of 2,500,000 $veTVC is reserved, accounting for 41.7% of the total initial supply of $TVC and $veTVC, underlining the protocol’s user-centric ethos. $TVC and $veTVC tokens allocated to the community and ecosystem are geared towards incentivizing contributions within the Velocore and Telos ecosystems and will be used for healthy community engagement and ecosystem synergy. A total of 4,000,000 $TVC tokens will be distributed for emissions, with a weekly emission start of 40,000 $TVC and an exponential decay rate of 0.5%. This ensures a sustainable increase in circulation without overwhelming the market. Users keen on forecasting can calculate weekly emissions using the previous week’s figures: Emissions are flexible and may be adjusted in response to market conditions and significant events, with any changes being communicated in advance to maintain transparency with the community. Velocore’s strategic initiatives on the Telos blockchain are a testament to the protocol’s commitment to innovation and user-centric development. The $veTVC airdrop and the thoughtful tokenomics pave the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem where every participant has the opportunity to thrive. Join us in this journey and be part of the DeFi community on Telos with Velocore!

Visualise a hectic metropolis, where the roads serve as conduits for data and the vehicles are packets of info. The roads are your data paths, the vehicles, your packets of information. Now imagine having control over every single junction and traffic light in that city. That’s what LayerZero is like for the crypto world — it’s an ecosystem controller where multiple blockchain protocols coexist. I remember when I first discovered it. I felt like Alice tumbling down a rabbit hole into Wonderland! This post offers you more than just some technical gobbledygook about blockchains or tokens though. We’ll explore everything from its initial funding journey to anticipated airdrops. Curious yet? There’s even more waiting ahead… Are you ready? Founded on a dream of creating an interoperable web, Layer Zero secured initial funding of $6.3 million, backed by prominent investors like Multicoin Capital and Binance. This early show of faith fuelled the start-up’s journey into becoming a major player in the crypto-ecosystem. This was only the beginning though. Further rounds saw significant buy-in from industry giants such as A16Z, Coinbase, Animoca, Multicoin again (they clearly liked what they saw), and even Christie’s — yes you heard it right. The renowned auction house isn’t one to be left behind in this digital age. All these investments culminated in an astonishing valuation for Layer Zero at $3 billion during its latest raise on April 4th 2023 — not bad for something that started out as just lines of code on a computer. While Layer Zero’s journey has been quite remarkable, what really sets them apart is their ability to draw funding from diverse quarters. The variety of backers — ranging from traditional VC funds like A16Z and Coinbase to innovative companies such as Animoca and Christie’s — demonstrates the broad appeal of Layer Zero’s vision. Each backer isn’t merely throwing money at the project. They see genuine value in LayerZero’s mission and are keen to support its success. With the crypto space abuzz, it’s impossible to ignore the excitement around a potential Layer Zero airdrop. We’re not just talking about any ordinary event here; this could be one of the biggest in crypto history. Rumours have been swirling that the snapshot for this much-anticipated event may have already taken place. This speculation is primarily due to an SSL certificate lodged for Layer Zero, hinting at something big on its way. This isn’t just some wishful thinking from eager traders either — market interpretation led to an 84% probability prediction. If you’re new to this whole game and are scratching your head right now, let me break it down: An ‘SSL Certificate’ acts like a seal of trust online, assuring users that their connection is secure and authenticated. In simpler terms? It means someone’s upping their web security game — possibly gearing up for heavy traffic related to…you guessed it…an airdrop. So when might we expect these digital goodies dropping into our crypto wallets? Based on patterns from previous high-profile projects (like Uniswap), there’s chatter about Q4 2023 or early 2024 as likely dates. But remember folks — always take these predictions with a grain of salt until official announcements roll out. In 2023, I unlocked a path to make over £200k from Airdrops using a straightforward yet powerful method — and I’m ready to share every step with you in this comprehensive course. Whether you’re just dipping your toes into the world of cryptocurrency or you’re a seasoned investor looking to refine your airdrop hunting skills, this course is designed for you. Here is a video review from a successful course member: As Bitcoin climbs and ‘airdrop season’ approaches, seize this opportunity to be perfectly positioned for substantial profits in 2024. Dive deep into six key airdrops poised to potentially offer a combined value easily exceeding £100k in payouts in 2024. These Airdrops I will teach you how to potentially get are: But that’s just the beginning — as you progress through the course, you’ll discover opportunities for numerous additional airdrops, each with significant earning potential. Below is another review from a real course subscriber: This course isn’t just about immediate gains; it’s a gateway to creating lasting, generational wealth.

For details on eligibility, vesting periods, airdrop calculations, and other topics related to the Terra Phoenix Airdrop, check out the proposal on Agora. Note: LUNA claimed in this airdrop that is subject to a vesting period will be undelegated by default, meaning that it won’t be automatically staked, earning rewards. Given that this LUNA won’t be liquid for at least 6 months from Genesis, depending on the users’ vesting schedule, users are encouraged to delegate their LUNA on Terra Station to earn staking rewards, vote on Terra governance proposals, and strengthen network security while their coins vest. Eligible users will have one month, from Sept. 4th, 2022 to Oct. 4th, 2022, to claim their airdrop. LUNA not claimed by Oct. 4th, 2022 will be returned to the Community Pool. This includes any unused gas fees. Open your browser and visit the claim interface at phoenix-airdrop.terra.money. Upon navigating to the site, you will see the screen below. IMPORTANT: To avoid phishing attacks, make sure that the URL you’re visiting is phoenix-airdrop.terra.money Next, click the ‘Select Wallet’ dropdown menu and choose which wallet you would like to connect. Eligible wallet providers include Terra Station, Terra Station Mobile, Keplr, and Metamask. If you’re connecting with Metamask or Keplr, select the origin chain that you held your USTC, LUNC, or aUST on during the pre- and post-attack snapshots. For details on the specific timing of the pre- and post-attack snapshots for each chain, see the ‘Airdrop Eligibility’ section on the Agora proposal. After connecting your wallet, the LUNA eligible to claim will show up, as seen in the example below. Enter a new Terra wallet address where you would like to receive your airdrop. If you don’t have one yet, you can set one up on Terra Station in two minutes using this simple setup guide. After entering your new wallet address, verify that the wallet does not have any previous transaction history, and check the box that says “I verify this is a new wallet address with no transaction history”. If the wallet address you’ve entered is invalid, meaning that it has a previous transaction history or has already been used to claim the airdrop, you will see the message below. After entering your new Terra wallet address and ensuring that it has no prior transaction history, sign the transaction using your wallet from Step 2. Do note that a small amount of LUNA will be deducted from the airdrop amount to account for gas fees for those claiming from non-Terra chains. IMPORTANT: The transaction body you should see when completing this transaction can be found below, based on the wallet you’re signing the transaction on. Users are encouraged to compare this transaction body to the one on the claim interface to avoid any loss of funds via potential phishing scams: After signing the transaction using your wallet from Step 2, your LUNA will arrive in your new Terra wallet address! 🎉 For users facing the ‘Something went wrong signing the transaction. Try again or check discord’ error, follow these steps to resolve: You should now be able to claim your airdrop ✅ On Terra, there are a variety of things you can do once you’ve claimed your LUNA airdrop: If you’d like to learn more about Terra, check out some of the resources below 👇 "

Full details of the LUNA airdrop can be found in our previous Medium article. The calculation logic for the LUNA airdrop will be the subject of this post. Total Supply of LUNA: 1 Billion Pre-Attack Snapshot Height: 7544910 (2022–05–07 14:59:37 UTC) Post-Attack Snapshot Height: 7790000 (2022–05–26 16:38:08 UTC) Below are the airdrop ratios to determine the LUNA to be airdropped to a wallet on Terra 2.0 if the wallet held aUST, LUNA (now called LUNC), or UST (now called USTC) during the Pre- and Post-Attack snapshots. For example, if a user held 1 LUNA (now called LUNC) during the Pre-Attack snapshot, the user would be entitled to an airdrop of 1.034735071 LUNA on the new chain. Below are the exchange rates for each liquid staking derivative of LUNC for both the Pre- and Post-Attack snapshots. For example, if a user held 1 cLUNA during the Pre-Attack snapshot, the user’s wallet would be considered to have held 1 LUNC during that period, and would be airdropped the appropriate amount based on that. Using the formula below, one can calculate a LUNA airdrop allocation for a given wallet by inserting the figures they get from Tables 2 and 3 above, and inputting the wallet balance for the different assets at the Pre- and Post-Attack snapshots. Pre-Attack aUST Ratio * min(aUST balance, 500k) + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * LUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * Bonded LUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * Unbonding LUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * cLUNA exchange rate * cLUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * pLUNA exchange rate * pLUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * bLUNA exchange rate * bLUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * stLUNA exchange rate * stLUNA balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * STEAK exchange rate * STEAK balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * LunaX exchange rate * LunaX balance + Pre-Attack LUNC Ratio * nLUNA exchange rate * nLUNA balance + Post-Attack UST Ratio * (aUST balance + UST balance) + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * LUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * Bonded LUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * Unbonding LUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * cLUNA exchange rate * cLUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * pLUNA exchange rate * pLUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * bLUNA exchange rate * bLUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * stLUNA exchange rate * stLUNA balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * STEAK exchange rate * STEAK balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * LunaX exchange rate * LunaX balance + Post-Attack LUNC Ratio * nLUNA exchange rate * nLUNA balance = LUNA Airdrop Allocation If the final allocation of new LUNA to the address is less than 1 LUNA, the airdrop will be allocated to the community pool. The new Terra network will inherit the deep developer pool and passionate LUNAtic community that made Terra Classic the 2nd largest smart contract blockchain behind Ethereum.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

But first, we wanted to go through what has got us to this point. Our aim was to put in place staking that ultimately delivered value for the community. We had a huge amount of feedback and input from our community on what it could look like, how it could be structured, and what SXS reward levels would be appropriate. In addition, we did a large amount of market research with the aim to deliver a staking solution that was both fair and delivered value. We then wanted to ensure that the staking solution we put in place supported the project in the long term and we felt it was important to put user experience at the core of what we did. As we have always said, confidence and trust are paramount to us, we ensured our staking contract was fully audited. This took time as we wanted the external organization doing the audit to do a deep dive and we then implement any amends they suggested. Finally, as you will be aware, the role of staking within a Launchpad is to unlock tier benefits. This ensures that tier holders know that their SXS staked has unlocked all benefits open to them. But, we have also put in place an SXS reward element. This is something that was factored into our tokenomics and, we feel, is a major value add that we wanted to give long-term SXS holders. Ultimately the more SXS you hold and the longer you stake the larger the SXS reward you will get. There will be 7 pools in total: NB: Access to this pool is only open for 2 weeks from staking launch We have aimed to make staking as easy as possible. The steps are as follows: It is that simple and is broadly in line with other staking journeys out there, so it shouldn’t be anything too different.

A limiting or disempowering mindset prevents us from reaching our potential and achieving our greatest goals. Shifting to a more powerful perspective allows you to overcome obstacles and find opportunities. This helps reframe challenges as opportunities for growth. Our core beliefs form the basis of how we think. These core assumptions about who we are and what we are capable of are often born from childhood. Core beliefs like ""I’m not smart enough"" or ""I don’t deserve to succeed"" can limit us as adults. Start changing your mindset by carefully examining your core beliefs. Ask yourself, “Is this true 100% of the time?” and look for evidence that contradicts your assumptions. Exposing the irrationality of these self-limiting beliefs creates space for stronger beliefs to emerge. As with our core beliefs, the assumptions we hold about ourselves and the world influence the way we think. Identify important assumptions about your abilities, intelligence, relationships, and opportunities. Do these beliefs encourage and encourage you, or do they limit you with absolutes like “I can never do it”? Actively challenge assumptions by looking for evidence that they may not be entirely correct or reasonable. Look for examples from your own life that contradict your limiting beliefs. This will make your thinking more flexible. How we explain failure to ourselves has a huge impact on how we think. Classifying mistakes as “catastrophic” trains your mindset to avoid all risks. But failure is usually neutral feedback that shows you where you need to learn and practice more. Consciously formulate failures, setbacks, and mistakes as valuable feedback.

When you notice negative gossip, take a break. Challenge the irrational beliefs that are fueling negativity and intentionally change your internal dialogue. This requires vigilance and perseverance, but with practice it will get easier. Your habitual thinking patterns can be broken, freeing you from the unpleasant cycle of negative thoughts. Our minds often make exaggerated or irrational judgments about ourselves and our lives. Psychologists refer to these as “cognitive distortions.” Identifying and challenging your cognitive distortions is crucial for ending negative self-talk. When you notice self-critical thoughts arising, ask yourself: “Is this objectively 100% true or partially distorted?” Determine whether the review contains black-and-white extremes, overstates negatives, or makes unfair and sweeping generalizations.

We’ll be using an AI generator that barely anyone ever talks about it. And I’m pretty sure this story is going to leave your jaws dropped. Now, most of the side hustles I share are very simple, in terms of the structure and steps you need to follow. If you can use the tips I share to focus on a specific keyword in a smaller market, you’ll make money for sure. How many of us are fashionistas or love a good fabric pattern? Well what if I told you it was possible to start out your own fashion line with almost no effort. Yeah, I’m serious. And no, I’m not writing this story just for the fashionistas, there’s room for everyone with this side hustle. The best part is that I’ll be sharing highly popular online platforms, where you can sell these patterns to generate a steady stream of passive income. Now remember, the images we’re talking about are patterns So, we’ll be generating these patterns to sell online using AI art generatorsm And for this, allow me to introduce Creative Fabrica Spark. First, we need the ideas or niches. Simply head over to ChatGPT and ask for pattern ideas that can be generated with AI. Now, these are quite broad niche ideas, so let’s narrow them down a bit. Ask ChatGPT to give you 10–20 sub niches for your favorite category. Now that we have the ideas we need, let’s head over to Creative Fabrica Spark. So Creative Fabrica Spark is a suite of AI tools but we’re particularly interested in its pattern generator. So once you choose the pattern generator, it’s time to start generating. You can copy-paste this simple prompt & replace it with your specific idea to generate the pattern of your choice. Now, Here’s the pattern I generated with Creative Fabrica Spark using this same prompt. I don’t know about you but this pattern is pretty amazing. Now, With the ideas from ChatGPT and a tool like creative Fabrica Spark, you’ll be able to generate endless images and patterns to sell online. This has to be the most important part of this story, so pay attention. You guys loved Zazzle the last time I talked about it. So here’s another idea for you. At least this time, AI is doing almost everything for you. Now, Zazzle gets over 24.2 million visitors per month. On Zazzle, you just need to upload a digital copy of your pattern on products like Zazzle will then handle the entire shipping costs and customer service while you make passive income. Creating a Zazzle shop is free, and I found a seller who was making a pretty sustainable income of over $7,000 per month. This is another lesser known print on demand website, which means less competition and more sales for you. Don’t be deceived, Society 6 gets over 3.3 Million visitors every month and works just like Zazzle. Moreso, I found a seller who made $7,091 selling patterns on Society 6. Sounds familiar right? Creative Fabrica, Creative Fabrica Spark! Yeah, they’re the same website. So you can basically create and sell patterns on the same marketplace. The only difference is that you won’t be selling your pattern as a physical product but instead as a digital product that can either be In fact in my creative Fabrica shop, I sell AI generated patterns as bundles alongside my Canva templates. AI is getting better and better everyday. Before now, it would have taken a super skilled designer to make a pattern like what we generated. Now, with just a simple prompt, AI does it all. But wait! I got way too excited about this new found side hustle, that I almost forgot to mention something important. Well, I couldn’t also justify spending $19 on the subscription for this side hustle.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming.

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

Too many people seem to use money in ways that create problems, stress, and headaches. Money can be a wonderful tool, but only if you use it to simplify your life (not complicate it). Stop making unforced errors. Spend to simplify. Life definitely isn't fair. It's a troubling reality. But instead of wasting energy on every obstacle in your way, focus on what you can control and how you can break through. Stop looking out. Look in. Be accountable. Own your shit. In his 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech, Steve Jobs talked about having faith that the dots will somehow connect in your life. You take daily actions with complete uncertainty. Faith in the dots allows you to persevere and endure the uncertainty. Your 80-year-old self cares about the long-term compounding of the decisions of today. Your 10-year-old self reminds you to stay foolish and have some fun along the way. If you have the good fortune to be wealthy and successful in life, always be sure to share it with others. Support your family and friends when you're able. Give with no expectation of return. Always give more than you receive. My 30-for-30 approach: You were made to move.

You would first of all need to provide liquidity TTF/BNB on Pancakeswap to receive your Cake-LP tokens which you can stake on Tosdis to earn mining rewards in TTF. What you need · A BEP-20 compatible wallet like Trustwallet, Metamask, TokenPocket etc · Some TTF or TurboTrix tokens · Some BNB (BEP-20) tokens for providing TTF/BNB pairs and gass fees Step-by-step guide First of all, you will have to provide some liquidity on Pancakeswap. To do that, go to https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool and connect your wallet. Then follow these steps: 1. Click on “Add Liquidity” 2. Leave BNB as input number 1 3. Select TTF as input number 2 by pasting the TTF Token Smart Contract Address 0xa898df02906d40ec81900b3a5ba36ea20d09b7cc 4. Select how much of each token you want to put for liquidity, but remember that their value (in USD) has to be the same: 5. Approve the pool if you haven’t already, and then click on “Supply” 6. Wait for the transaction to be approved, and you will receive an amount of TTF/BNB liquidity tokens (named CAKE-LP) equal to your share of liquidity. Now that you have your CAKE-LP tokens in your wallet, you can go to https://app.tosdis.finance/farming and make sure you have connected your wallet and also selected Binance Smart Chain: Go to Unverified Pools and look for TTF Pool. Then follow these steps: · Approve the Pool · Click on Stake button, and select MAX · Confirm the transaction (make sure you have enough gas to pay for it) · Earn free TTF tokens! Our pool has insane APY! (The APY is adjusted according to the size of the liquidity pool) Congratulations, you can now start earning TTFs each block! General Warnings on Liquidity Providing In order to provide liquidity you always need to provide the same value of both tokens. This means that if you want to put a liquidity worth of 100 TTF tokens, and let’s say, it’s worth 20$ at that time, you also need to provide 20$ worth of BNB tokens. While providing liquidity you have to understand the phenomenon of impermanent loss. Impermanent loss happens when the price of your tokens changes compared to when you deposited them in the pool. The larger the change is, the bigger the loss. So why do liquidity providers still provide liquidity if they’re exposed to potential losses? Well, impermanent loss can still be counteracted by trading fees. In fact, even pools that are quite exposed to impermanent loss can be profitable thanks to the trading fees. While we have a large amount of TTF tokens reserved for the liquidity mining program, these rewards will be distributed among all liquidity providers that are staking, so the APY and rewards will change accordingly. Final note: the larger the liquidity, the healthier the market. This means less volatility on each trade, with the risk of impermanent loss decreasing drastically. TosDis’ webapp integrates with 4 of the wallets that are compactible with PancakeSwap, you will need to use one of these wallets to stake your LP tokens to get TTF rewards: "

The study’s conclusions are hardly surprising, but which someone had to provide concrete data for, and that’s what we academics are for: the introduction of the ChatGPT generative algorithm a year ago has had significant negative effects on creative professions such as graphic designers and copywriters. Using data from copywriters and graphic designers on the freelancing platform Upwork, the researchers found that these professionals not only experienced a significant drop in the number of jobs they could bid for, but even steeper drops in earnings, suggesting not only that generative AI is taking away their jobs, but that it tends to devalue the dwindling volume of work they still do. The case of copywriters and graphic designers is particularly interesting because it illustrates the phenomenon of direct substitution: the work that someone used to request from one of these professionals, even considering the possible iterations until a satisfactory result was obtained, can now be carried out directly by the generative algorithm. The results are significant and amount to around 2% in the number of jobs obtained monthly, and 5.2% in monthly income from the time ChatGPT was released. Moreover, workers who previously typically earned the highest incomes and who completed a greater number of jobs do not result in a lower likelihood of seeing their employment and income decline, but even worse outcomes, implying that having more skills is no protection against job or income loss. These results suggest that, in the short term, generative AI reduces the overall demand for knowledge workers of all types, and may also have the potential to reduce gaps between workers. As time goes on, we will undoubtedly see more academic work trying to quantify the effect of the emergence of generative algorithms. Their widespread adoption following the launch of ChatGPT over the last 12 monthsprovides a discontinuity in time that makes it easy to quantify the effects on individual practitioners. Moving from the realm of untested hypotheses to concrete and specific quantification and proving that there are indeed significant effects on society is a first step towards making predictions about different industries and labor markets, and may well affect the regulation of the use of such tools in the future.

The idea is to launch two new subscription tiers, one below the current eight dollars a month for X Premium, with all the features but with ads, and another more expensive one, without ads. X also wants users to pay a small fee, one dollar a year, which will allow them to carry out all the usual actions, from posting content to “liking”, reposting, replying, bookmarking or quoting posts, while users who do not pay this amount will get a read-only account that will only be used to view posts and follow accounts. This scheme, which has been in testing in New Zealand and the Philippines for a few days now, is part of the company’s plan to reduce the number of fake accounts created on bot factories, thereby reducing some of the non-genuine activity. In addition, the company is paying content creators who are signed up to its premium service based on the popularity of their updates and the revenue they generate in ads or subscriptions, something it already started doing a few months ago in selected markets. The big question, of course, is to what extent requiring a subscription fee will stop bot factories. Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress and its highly successful Akismet anti-spam extension, knows about this from personal experience: he’s just published a brief note saying that Musk’s proposals seem like a good idea and definitely introduces a proof of work. The history of the web seems to affirm that these kinds of disincentives are not enough to prevent spam. According to Mullenweg, the incentive to manipulate X is such that those with a vested interest to do so will spend any amount of money, as is the case with other variations of spam where spammers purchase, for example, domain names that cost more than a dollar a year, and simply hope that the revenue they make from their activity will be enough to compensate them. Spam is a billion-dollar industry that attracts significant capital investments. In the case of activity aimed at election manipulation, the potential benefit from changing a government or destabilizing a country is so great as to outweigh the need… "

Alex is the head of technology strategy, development and execution, and is the most visible face of the project, given that Sam Altmann is engaged in many more projects, notably OpenA, and that Max Novendstern left WorldCoin last year to develop other related projects, although he remains as an advisor. Our conversation revolved around the challenges of the controversial biometric identity project, principally its commitment to privacy — as it says on its website: “Worldcoin doesn’t want to know who you are, just that you’re unique.” Acquiring a Worldcoin digital identity involves having one’s iris scanned, from which a fragment of the reading is recorded and given a unique hash or iris code that cannot be used to identify the person, and is instead used to demonstrate their uniqueness. The method has polarized opinion, but has been supported by many leading figures involved in cryptocurrencies, among them Vitalik Buterin, while some state agencies dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and rights of citizens have already given it their approval. To understand this issue, one has to bear in mind the potential problems that the development of a technology like generative AI will bring in a very short time. AI bots of all types already being developed by companies like Meta and many others will allow us to go beyond deepfakes to create synthetic social networks made up of thousands of profiles in the form of citizens of a given country that can act in a coordinated and organized way to simulate opinions and social trends of any kind, intermingled with genuine people. All this is a huge threat to democracy, creating a playground for anyone seeking to manipulate participation. Identification systems that make it possible to ensure that someone is indeed human, but without the need to reveal their name or personal data, has huge potential, hence Worldcoin’s plan is not simply to offer a cryptocurrency such as WLD and propose it as the basis for systems based on… "

In other words, “do the math”. Generative algorithms are costly, requiring the development of models with billions of variables: until very recently, even the most sophisticated machine learning automation models had barely a few hundred. But companies could offset development costs against their long-term amortization, finding patient venture capitalists willing to wait for the maturation of the investment. The problem arises with models whose training cannot be stopped and require constant iterations to generate new, more advanced versions that take into account a constantly changing context. At the same time, they face very high operating costs, which generate constant negative cash flows. If training costs are already high, inference costs far exceed the scale of the previous ones, and grow even more as the model gets larger. ChatGPT costs more than $700,000 a day to run: every time someone asks it a question, the company loses money, either because it’s a free user, or because it is a paying user getting their money’s worth. Finding a price that would allow a balance with respect to the costs it generates would surely mean that very few people would be able to use it on a daily basis. Even with its growth in turnover, charging $20 a month to premium users, the company is far from covering its costs. Due to its myriad and mounting costs ChatGPT has been described as a pact with the devil. An analysis of the costs of running large language models (LLMs) shows that running them is simply not financially viable, and helps understand why Google, at the beginning of this arms race to have the best generative algorithm, hesitated before joining in.

At first glance, they may not seem like much. Reading OpenAI’s announcements, it’s easy to get bogged down in the nerdy specificity of some of these new additions. But make no mistake; as technical as they may seem, OpenAI’s new announcements have the potential to change the world just as much as ChatGPT did around this time last year. Here’s the core of what OpenAI announced, and why it matters. One of OpenAI’s most exciting announcements was the availability of the GPT-4 Vision platform through their API. Previously, OpenAI had released the Vision platform only via their ChatGPT interface. Vision is super powerful, but was somewhat limited — in order to use it, you needed to log into ChatGPT and upload your images manually, a few at a time. Adding Vision to OpenAI’s API is a game changer. It means that instead of having to use a manual process, developers can now build vision capabilities directly into their own applications. A screen-reader company, for example, could build the system into their software, allowing visually impaired readers to have a description of any image on the internet instantly created and read aloud as they surf. I tested this new capability myself and it’s pretty remarkable. Media companies like my company, Gado Images, can use the Vision platform to understand the visual contents of our databases of tens of thousands, or even millions, of images. That capability makes it way easier to locate valuable parts of a collection. "

Despite popular opinion, it is one of the safest and lowest carbon forms of energy. It is also one of the few on-demand forms of low-carbon energy. As such, it will be a crucial technology as we transition to net-zero. However, the nuclear industry faces a massive problem: it costs too much. New nuclear power plants cost tens of billions of dollars and take well over a decade to build, and once built, the energy they produce is some of the most expensive on the market. This has led many governments and energy providers to distance themselves from this planet-saving technology. But a new type of reactor called an SMR promises to solve all of these issues and kick-start a nuclear renaissance, saving the nuclear industry. However, a pioneering SMR project has just been cancelled because costs are ballooning out of control. So, the question has to be asked: is the future of nuclear energy doomed? Possibly not. Let’s start at the beginning: what is an SMR? SMR stands for Small Modular Reactor. Typical nuclear power plants have several enormous custom-built reactors. These are incredibly complex and must be carefully and accurately assembled on-site. This skyrockets the construction cost and deployment time. SMRs solve this by using reactors small enough to be fully assembled off-site in a controlled factory and then shipped to the location. These reactors produce less power, so you need more of them, generally over 10, to make a power plant. However, the overall cost of these reactors per MW of power should be far cheaper than regular reactors, as the factory can use economies of scale to lower prices. Deployment should also be far quicker, as reactors can be built ahead of time, and their small nature and controlled production facility make construction far quicker. There is even a flexibility advantage, as an SMR plant can add or remove reactors quickly to better meet demand. Ordinary reactors take decades and billions of dollars to expand their output. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Several companies are pioneering SMR technology.

She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive.

The fact we feel we are ‘here’. Let alone anyone actually trying to find physical mechanisms. I’ve gone on the record as stating that self-aware consciousness is arguably the most profound phenomenon in the universe. For a multitude of reasons. Ranging from a lack of scientific handles to come anywhere near close to touching it. To the arguable luxury of it, life would function just fine without it. And there’s the wondrous experience of consciousness itself. After all, we are trying to explain the feeling of being a ‘soul’. Not just the fact we respond cognitively as if we are one. The point is we all know that we sense our thoughts, actually see the full visual field, its colors, and feel our pain. Literally. I’ve even stated that this is consistent with a simulation / avatar view – given multiple quantum physicists (including myself) see hints of simulation in the universe – or even a theistic ‘God’ view – of the origin of consciousness. To not think that at all must be a little self-deceptive or highly lacking in openness or curiosity IMO. Surely. Consciousness is damned unexpected. The actual experience of self-awareness is staggering to think about from a scientific point of view. Why aren’t we all just ‘philosophical zombies’ as David Chalmers would put it, simply responding to sensory input? But without any visceral perception. Without sentience there literally would be . . . . nothing to actually experience this universe. "

The dataset can be found here. Walmart is one of the biggest retailers and among the go-to retail stores for one’s household shopping. Known for its lowest prices and cost savings across product categories, a visit to its physical stores is an experience in itself. It is a retail business that generates USD 567 billion worth of sales volume. Walmart has a Data Science and Analytics department that is dedicated to improving customer-client-employee relationships by forecasting sales, recommending products based on customer buying trends, product/customer segmentation, and several other use cases of data science. In 2014, Walmart hosted a recruiting competition on Kaggle. Job-seekers were provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and we are tasked with predicting the department-wide sales for each store. In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. The business problem I am trying to solve is to forecast future sales data by training machine learning models on historical data. Sales forecasting helps every business make better business decisions. It helps in overall business planning, budgeting, and risk management. It allows companies to efficiently allocate resources for future growth and manage their cash flow. Sales forecasting also helps businesses to estimate their costs and revenue accurately based on which they are able to predict their short-term and long-term performance. Type and size of 45 stores Data related to the store, department, and regional activity like fuel price, customer price index, unemployment rate, etc. for the given dates The historical training data cover dates in the range 2010–02–05 to 2012–11–01. Weekly Sales is a labeled continuous numeric feature. Hence, this is an application of Supervised ML, specifically, it is a regression problem. Preparing historical store sales data by cleaning, transforming, and encoding categorical variables as necessary. Perform feature engineering and feature selection. Heatmap of the correlation matrix Weekly Sales vs. Week of Year Weekly Sales vs. Month of Year Weekly Sales vs. Day of Month Weekly Sales vs. Quarter Average Weekly Sales vs. Store Weekly Sales vs. Store Type Temperature vs. Weekly Sales Weekly Sales vs IsHoliday Weekly Sales vs Store Size and Store Type Weekly Sales vs. Department In this section, I have performed the following tasks Since this is a regression problem, I shall set LinearRegression() model as my baseline ML model. I have additionally trained Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, and SGDRegressor in order to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the performance of all linear models offered by Sklearn. I have created a function try_linear_models(model) that takes in the model as input, performs training on training data, and returns the training and validation root mean squared errors. We see that the linear models on average returns RMSE scores of ~$20,000. This is a very poor performance by our baseline ML models as ~20,000 is around the 75th percentile of weekly sales. The model r2 score is very low and therefore I do not find it necessary to investigate the linear models further. I have trained ensemble models like random forest, gradient boosting, adaboost, XGBoost, and LightGBM with default parameters as an initial check to see which models have better evaluation score. I have created a function try_ensemble_methods() which takes in the model as input and returns the evaluation metrics. There are the evaluation scores — The top three performing models are Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM and therefore I will go ahead with hyperparameter tuning for these models. AdaBoost performs as poorly as the linear models. The hyperparameter tuning is evaluated based on weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) . I created a dictionary called models with hyper-parameters and values to test. Functions test_params() and test_param_and_plot() trained the models for each of these hyperparameters and returned the evaluation scores for each run. The overfitting curves for random forest hyperparameter tuning are — The overfitting curves for XGBoost hyperparameter tuning are — The overfittng curves for LightGBM hyperparameter tuning are — I find that after hyperparameter tuning, the model that works best with this data is Random Forest. From hyperparameter tuning, random forest seems to work the best — it provides the best validation scores ~2000. Further, I used the GridSearchCV to obtain the best fit random forest model. Am I satisfied/confident with this model? NO. Did I learn how to implement an end-to-end ML project? YES. Better sales forecasting can be performed by employing time-series modeling techniques like ARIMA. The top predictions in kaggle have all employed some form of time-series techniques. This project can be improved by doing so. Applications of time series forecasting are web traffic forecasting, sales and demand forecasting, weather prediction, stock price forecasting, among others. It is an important branch of machine learning and more companies employ time-series modeling in some form or another. It is therefore crucial for a budding data scientist to be familiar with this concept. I would like to thank jovian.ai, especially Aakash, for providing excellent learning materials as part of the data science and machine learning bootcamp. Most of the code is inspired from the bootcamp tutorials and ChatGPT of course. "

Almost all data analytics or data science professionals do this process before generating insights or doing data modeling. In real life, this process took a lot of time, depending on the complexity and completeness of the dataset we have. Of course, more variables make us explore more to get the summary we need before doing the next steps. That’s why using R or Python, the most common programming language to do data analysis, some packages help to do that process faster and easier, but not better. Why not better? Because it only shows us a summary, before we focus to explore deeper any variables we find “interesting”. In R, we can use these libraries: In Python, we can use these libraries: Let’s try each library listed above to know what they look like and how they can help us do exploratory data analysis! In this post, I will use the iris dataset which is common to be used to learn how to code in R or Python. In R, you can use this code to load the iris dataset: In Python, you can use this code to load the iris dataset: First, we need to execute the simple code below: From the first snapshot (Image 3), we already get a lot of information about the iris dataset: From the second snapshot (Image 4): From the third snapshot (Image 5): Based on the data report above created using dataMaid in R, we already get a lot of information regarding the iris dataset, only by executing a one-line code. 😃 First, we need to execute the simple code below: From the first until the sixth snapshot (Images 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), the information we got was not much different from the previous package. From the seventh snapshot (Image 12), we got the QQ plot for each numerical variable in the iris dataset. From the eighth snapshot (Image 13), we got the correlation matrix for each variable in the iris dataset. We can see some information such as: The ninth snapshot (Image 14), using principal component analysis (PCA), provides the percentage of the variance explained by principal components with a note that labels indicate the cumulative percentage of explained variance, it shows 62%, the higher the better. For the explanation of PCA, I think I need another post for this. 😆 The tenth snapshot (Image 15) provides the relative importance of each variable, it shows that Petal.Length has the highest importance which is almost 0.5, followed by Petal.Width , and so on. First, we need to execute the simple code below: From Images 16, 17, 18, 23, and 24, the information we got was not much different from the previous package. From Image 19, shows us the density plot of each variable including the skewness and kurtosis measurement, which is used to tell us whether the data is normally distributed or not. The explanation of skewness and kurtosis also needs another post I guess 😅 From Image 20, 21, and 22, shows us the scatter plot between numerical variables available in the iris dataset which is telling us the correlation, visually. It gives us similar information to the correlation matrix which is in numeric format. Using the three packages above, we got a lot of information about the iris dataset, much faster than we trying to create it manually, but it’s not enough, that’s why I said in the title “…faster and easier…”, because it only gives us a glimpse of the iris dataset, but at least it gives us which things we can start to working on rather than looking for starting point, such as: First, we need to execute the simple code below: Mostly, it shows similar information. I will try to mention some information that is quite different from previous packages: First, we need to execute the simple code below: The output of this package is very different from previous packages, in terms of how to use it, the content is quite similar, but it makes us can explore better. First, we need to execute the simple code below: Using this package, the UI and UX are very different, please enjoy the show! First, we need to execute the simple code below: Using the code above, some tabs are generated in the browser. The new things that we can see using this package: Using the four packages above, we got a lot of information about the iris dataset, not too much difference compared to R packages, but still when having more perspective is usually better than having less perspective. Some notes: It depends. I think we can cut the time we need to do EDA is already a good thing. Let’s try to explore each package explained above and use it wisely, not as the main solution. In my humble opinion, exploring the data should be the “fun” part of data analysis, so don’t be afraid to get “dirty” by doing the EDA manually, sometimes the non-automated method is still the best. 👍 Woah, I’ve just realized this post contains 43 images. If you reach this point, I’m grateful that you want to read and learn about how to automate the EDA process through my post. I hope you enjoy this post and learn how to use it in your journey as a data analytics/science professional. I am learning to write, mistakes are unavoidable, even when I try my best.

Fortunately, people won’t spot it because we always fix those errors. But how about the mistakes that give no errors? These are the trickiest, but the pros could easily call them out. These mistakes are not related to the API or syntax of the tool you are using but are directly associated with best practices and how much time you spend on a tool. Today, we are here to talk about six of such mistakes that come up often among beginner Pandas users, and we will learn how to solve them. It is kind of ironic that the first mistake is related to actually using Pandas for certain tasks. Specifically, today’s real-world tabular datasets are just massive. To read them into your environment with Pandas would be a huge mistake. Why? Because it is so damn slow! Below, we load the TPS October dataset from 2021 with 1M rows and ~300 features, taking up a whopping 2.2GB of disk space. It took ~22 seconds. Now, you might be saying that 22 seconds isn’t that much, but imagine this. In a single project, you will perform many experiments during different stages. You will probably create separate scripts or notebooks for cleaning, feature engineering, choosing a model, and many more for other tasks. Waiting for the data to load for 20 seconds multiple times really gets on your nerves. Besides, your dataset can be even larger. So, what is a faster solution? The solution is to ditch Pandas at this stage and use other alternatives that are designed explicitly for fast IO. For this stage, my favorite one is datatable but you can also go for Dask, Vaex, cuDF, or even polars. Here is how long it takes to load the same dataset with datatable: "
https://rumn.medium.com/convex-vs-non-convex-functions-why-it-matters-in-optimization-for-machine-learning-39cd9427dfcc?source=post_page-----210b2b038331--------------------------------,"If you have been delving into the world of machine learning, you may have encountered the phrases “convex” and “non-convex” functions in the context of optimization algorithms and loss minimization. In the domain of machine learning, the loss function can either be a convex or non-convex function. Convex and non-convex functions play an important role in machine learning, particularly in optimization problems where we need to find the minimum or maximum value of a loss function. This article we will explore what convex and non-convex functions are and why they are important in machine learning. The maxima and minima of a function refer to the highest and lowest points, respectively, on the graph of the function. In mathematical terms, we can find the maxima and minima of a function by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero. The points where the derivative equals zero are known as critical points. We then analyze the behaviour of the function near these critical points to determine whether they are maxima or minima. To gain a good understanding of convex and non-convex functions, it is crucial to have a grasp of concepts such as local minima, global minima, and saddle points. Local minima refer to a situation where the optimization algorithm finds a set of model parameters that correspond to the minimum value of the loss function in a small region of the parameter space. However, this minimum value may not be the global minimum of the loss function, which corresponds to the smallest value of the loss function across the entire parameter space. Global minima are the absolute lowest points of the loss function, which correspond to the optimal set of parameters for a model. The goal of any optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum, which will produce the best results for the given problem. A saddle point is a point in the parameter space where the loss function has a minimum value in one direction and a maximum value in another direction. At a saddle point, the gradient of the loss function is zero, which means that the optimization algorithm may get stuck and not be able to converge to the global minimum. Saddle points can be problematic for optimization algorithms, and various methods have been proposed to deal with them, such as momentum-based methods and stochastic gradient descent. The term “loss” in machine learning refers to the discrepancy or error between the predicted output of a model and the actual output. In other words, it represents the difference between what the model expected to see and what it actually observed. The loss of a machine learning model is calculated with the help of a loss function, and a lower loss value is indicative of a better model performance. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a machine learning model with minimal loss to improve its accuracy. To achieve minimal loss, we need to adjust the model’s parameters. The goal of loss minimization is to reduce the overall error or loss of the model. This process involves using optimization algorithms like gradient descent, which iteratively modifies the model’s parameters to minimize the loss. These optimization algorithms are critical in machine learning because they help to minimize loss, and choosing the right algorithm is crucial. When selecting an optimization algorithm, it is essential to consider whether the loss function is convex or non-convex. A convex loss function has only one global minimum and no local minima, making it easier to solve with a simpler optimization algorithm. However, a non-convex loss function has both local and global minima and requires an advanced optimization algorithm to find the global minimum. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these concepts to enhance your understanding further. Convex functions are particularly important because they have a unique global minimum. This means that if we want to optimize a convex function, we can be sure that we will always find the best solution by searching for the minimum value of the function. This makes optimization easier and more reliable. From more mathematical point of view A function f(x) is convex if for any two points x1 and x2 in the domain of f(x), and for any “t” in the range [0,1], the following condition must holds true: In simpler terms, this means that the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above or on the graph of the function, and not below it. Another way to visualize this property is to imagine a bowl-shaped curve where the function’s value increases as you move away from the bottom of the bowl. This curvature ensures that there is only one global minimum, and no local minima, which makes optimization simpler. A lot of the common loss functions, including the following, are convex functions: A function is said to be non-convex if it is not convex. Geometrically, a non-convex function is one that curves downwards or has multiple peaks and valleys. Looks something like this : The challenge with non-convex functions is that they can have multiple local minima, which are points where the function has a lower value than all neighboring points. This means that if we try to optimize a non-convex function, we may get stuck in a local minimum and miss the global minimum, which is the optimal solution we are looking for. From more mathematical point of view A function f(x) is non-convex if for any two points x1 and x2 in the domain of f(x), and for any “t” in the range [0,1], such that: In other words, the line segment between two points on the graph of the function can lie below the graph in some places, creating hills and valleys. Let’s understand this above statement in simple terms Imagine a function that has a “hill” in the middle, like a bell curve. If we choose two points on opposite sides of the hill, then the line segment between these points will intersect the hill at some point. Now, if the height of the function at this intersection point is less than the height of the line segment at the same point, then the function is non-convex. This means that there exist points on the function where the curve dips down below the straight line connecting two other points. This is what creates the hills and valleys in the function, and can make it more difficult to find the global minimum. A lot of the common loss functions, including the following, are non-convex functions: Convex and non-convex functions are important concepts in machine learning, particularly in optimization problems. Convex functions have a unique global minimum, making optimization easier and more reliable. Non-convex functions, on the other hand, can have multiple local minima, making optimization more challenging. When working with non-convex functions, it is important to use optimization algorithms that can help us avoid getting stuck in local minima. For example, gradient descent with random initialization and annealing can help us find good solutions even in non-convex optimization problems. In summary, understanding the difference between convex and non-convex functions is essential for machine learning practitioners who want to optimize functions efficiently and reliably. "

In this article, you will learn about a bunch of common and lesser-known evaluation metrics and charts to understand how to choose the model performance metric for your problem. Simply put a classification metric is a number that measures the performance that your machine-learning model when it comes to assigning observations to certain classes. Binary classification is a particular situation where you just have two classes positive and negative. Typically the performance is presented on a range from 0 to 1 (though not always) where a score of 1 is reserved for the perfect model. The performance matrix is specific to binary classification problems. Let’s assume you have a dataset like this. Here y is the actual output and ŷ is the predicted output. Can we come up with a conclusion as to what is the accuracy of this specific model? We can use a performance Matrix to calculate the accuracy called a confusion matrix. Well, it is a performance measurement for machine learning classification problems where the output can be two or more classes. It is a table with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values. First, we can create a confusion matrix for this. First of all, we can calculate the possible outputs for the given dataset. This is the result. Now let’s create the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy. This is what we call a Confusion Matrix. Using this Confusion Matrix we need to find out the accuracy of this Model. These 2 boxes(Pink color) give us the right output. Now we can get the accuracy using this equation to the above example. Always your model should try to reduce False Negative and False Positive values. As an example, a machine learning model is trained to predict tumors in patients. The test dataset consists of 100 people. True Positive (TP) — the model correctly predicts the positive class (prediction and actual both are positive). In the above example, 10 people who have tumors are predicted positively by the model.True Negative (TN) — the model correctly predicts the negative class (prediction and actual both are negative). In the above example, 60 people who don’t have tumors are predicted negatively by the model.False Positive (FP) — model gives the wrong prediction of the negative class (predicted-positive, actual-negative). In the above example, 22 people are predicted as positive for having a tumor, although they don’t have a tumor. FP is also called a TYPE I error.False Negative (FN) — model wrongly predicts the positive class (predicted-negative, actual-positive). In the above example, 8 people who have tumors are predicted as negative. FN is also called a TYPE II error. With the help of these four values, we can calculate the True Positive Rate (TPR), False Negative Rate (FPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and False Negative Rate (FNR). If we have an imbalanced dataset it will affect the algorithm(As an example if you have 1s and 0s and you have 0s more than 1s like 1000 0s and 200 1s’. And you will get accuracy for 0s -> 1000/1000+200 -> 1000 / 1200 -> 83.33%. This is a good accuracy. But your data are imbalanced(biased)). So we should not depend on the accuracy only when we calculate the performance of the imbalanced dataset. There are some other terminologies that can be used. Precision means out of all the predicted positive values how many of them have been truly predicted as true positives. In this particular scenario, our aim is to reduce False Positive(FP). We can denote this by an equation. As an example in the Spam Classification if any spam mail remains undetected (false negative) it is okay, but what if we miss any critical mail because it is classified as spam (False positive)? In this situation, a False Positive should be as low as possible. Here, precision is more vital as compared to recall. Recall means out of all actual true positive values how many of them have been predicted as true positives? In this particular scenario, our aim is to reduce False Negative(FN). We can name recall as True Positivity and Sensitivity. We can denote this as an equation, As an example, we do not want to miss any cancer patients. Therefore, we want the false negative to be as low as possible(If a person does not have cancer and the model predicts that he has cancer(False Positive). This is okay, that person can do a test and check whether he has cancer or not. But if a person has cancer but the model predicts as not a cancer patient(False Negative) is not good. we need to reduce that). In these situations, we can compromise with the low precision, but recall should be high. If you need to consider Precision and Recall both at the same time, you can use F-Score. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Here in F-Score, you have 3 different formulas. F1 Score— Here the focus is on both False positives and False negatives and both important. F0.5 Score — Here False positive is more important than Flase negative. F2 Score— Here False negative is more important than Flase positive. β is the deciding parameter to pick the correct formula for F-Score. Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F-score provide better insights into the prediction as compared to accuracy performance metrics.

Many of you still have a confusion regarding this topic. So in this article, I am going to explain to you what exactly Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are considering all these technologies and work. Basically, Artificial Intelligence enables the machine to think. Without any human interaction, the machine will be able to make its own decisions and it is the final goal. As an example self-driving Car, an app that uses machine learning and deep learning is basically an AI application. It does some kind of tasks. At the simplest level, machine learning uses algorithms trained on data sets to create machine learning models that allow computer systems to perform tasks like making song recommendations, identifying the fastest way to travel to a destination, or translating text from one language to another. Some of the most common examples of AI in use today include: When we talk about Machine Learning it is a subset of AI. Machine Learning provides us with statistical tools to explore and understand the data. Machine Learning has 3 different approaches. In common usage, the terms “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” are often used interchangeably with one another due to the prevalence of machine learning for AI purposes in the world today. But, the two terms are meaningfully distinct. While AI refers to the general attempt to create machines capable of human-like cognitive abilities, machine learning specifically refers to the use of algorithms and data sets to do so. Machine learning is typically the most mainstream type of AI technology in use around the world today. Some of the most common examples of machine learning that you may have interacted with in your day-to-day life include: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Can we make the machine learn like how we actually try to learn things using our brains? That is the main idea behind the deep learning. In Deep Learning we create an architecture which is called Multi Neural Network Architecture. The main idea behind Deep Learning is to mimic the human brain. The adjective “deep” in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. Deep learning drives many AI applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. Deep learning technology lies behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars). Deep Learning has various techniques. In this article, I hope you get a good idea about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We will see you in the next article. Thank you!

Underneath of code of Spring, Security is going to be using a security chain. Spring Security’s web infrastructure is based entirely on standard servlet filters. It doesn’t use servlets or any other servlet-based frameworks (such as Spring MVC) internally, so it has no strong links to any particular web technology. It deals in HttpServletRequests and HttpServletResponses and doesn't care whether the requests come from a browser, a web service client, an HttpInvoker or an AJAX application. Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required. The ordering of the filters is important as there are dependencies between them. If you have been using namespace configuration, then the filters are automatically configured for you and you don’t have to define any Spring beans explicitly but there may be times when you want full control over the security filter chain, either because you are using features which aren’t supported in the namespace, or you are using your own customized versions of classes. First of all look at this diagram given below we first send an HTTP request to our server what is going to happen is it will go through a set of Security Filters. They are just chains of filters that you used to do or perform certain actions on Spring Security. It is almost like a Middleware and it has the name of FilterChain because of the chain of responsibility pattern. The HTTP request going to pass through it and the response also pass through the filters based on the way that it is going. Then finally the request is routed to the controllers by this servlet. Servlet takes the HTTP request and does some kind of action to it depending on the Java code. The name chain suggests that you have a sequence of filters, with each filter doing some processing and then passing on to the next in sequence, so each object has a chain member to point to the next filter in the sequence, which gets called after the filter has performed its own processing. The last in the sequence will then probably have null as the chain value or it knows on its own that it is the last one in the sequence. This process internally invokes doFilter of the next filter in the filter chain, and, when the chain is over, it invokes the target servlet. All filters are chained (in the order of their definition in web.xml). The chain.doFilter() is proceeding to the next element in the chain. The last element of the chain is the target resource/servlet. What’s happening here is Spring Scerity provides a deligating Fiter Proxy and we called it Bean Filter. It allows us to do is just look at the request, so the servlet is going to get a request and response. Then these filters will be applied to those requests. This is a very important concept of architecture. These filters get applied and you can have different security filter chains that allow you to have one endpoint that’s ominous, and another one that requires authentication. Some could just say, “Okay, well just using a remember me cookie is just fine.” So it gives you a lot of flexibility in your architecture as to how you work with Spring Security. So Spring Security has been around for a long time. It's very mature, so you can do a lot of capabilities with it as to how you configure it. So the key takeaway I want you to have from this article is that Spring Security is setting up a filter chain and there os multiple filter chains based on your configurations. Those filters get applied to the request and response ahead of or behind the Soring Security Dispatcher Servlet. Now, let’s look at the core components that take part in the filter chain: Let’s implement this logic to get a perfect idea of what is this Security Filter Chain. Now create a folder called security in your project and create a class called SecurityConfig. This is the class we use to add our filter chain. Now add the annotation @Configuration to let the spring boot this is a configuration class and this needs to be added to the Bean Context. In the previous versions, we have used to WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to implement this and now WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter is deprecated. In Spring Security 5.7.0-M2 they deprecated the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, as they encourage users to move towards a component-based security configuration. To assist with the transition to this new style of configuration, they have compiled a list of common use cases and suggested alternatives going forward. In the examples below we follow best practices by using the Spring Security lambda DSL and the method HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests to define our authorization rules. If you are new to the lambda DSL you can read about it in this blog post. If you would like to learn more about why we choose to use HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests you can check out the reference documentation. In Spring Security 5.4 they introduced the ability to configure HttpSecurity by creating a SecurityFilterChain bean. Below is an example configuration using the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter that secures all endpoints with HTTP Basic: Going forward, the recommended way of doing this is to register a SecurityFilterChain bean: You can add any security chain expressions here like. In this article, we looked at the basic concept that applies to spring security. As we have seen, spring provides a lot of flexibility and allows us to customize security for complex applications.

Then we have to use Logistic regression. Logistic regression is a powerful technique that extends the capabilities of linear regression to classify data into groups. In this article, we will explore the derivation of logistic regression from linear regression with the mathematical background. Let’s consider following graph. Here I have plotted the regression line(red colour) for a dataset. Let’s assume we have a requirement to allocate these data points into two groups based on the regression line considering their location whether over the regression line or below the regression line. Then we can recolour the data points to see the two groups more clearly like in the following image. Now we can see both groups separately. Let’s assume, what if we want think like ‘need to assign a single higher value for all the blue data points and need to assign a single low value for all the orange data points’. This is something like putting burdens on orange data points to push them to the feet and attaching air balloons to blue data points to push them up and float on the surface of a tank. Now, all the blue data points have a same higher value and all the orange data points have a same lower value. The process should looks like in the following picture. What if we plot the data points in a graph and draw a linear regression line? It should looks like following picture. Now, we have the idea of how the logistic regression works. Let’s see which kind of mathematical operation is used to classify data in to two levels. If P is the probability of an event happening, then 1-P is event not happening. In probability and statistics, odds are a way of expressing the likelihood or probability of an event occurring. In the context of logistic regression, odds represent the ratio of the probability of a certain outcome to the probability of the complementary outcome. Regarding above explanation, we can mathematically use it like following. For a linear regression model, the equation is, In linear regression, we assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variables or features (x1, x2, …, xn). The coefficients (β0, β1, β2, . . . , βn) represent the slopes of the linear relationship. In statistics and regression analysis, the response variable (Y) is the variable we want to predict or model. In some cases, the response variable Y may be categorical, such as binary (e.g., yes/no) or multi-class (e.g., low/medium/high). However, most regression models are designed to work with continuous response variables. we need to use a link function to transform it into a continuous variable suitable for regression modelling. Let’s consider a binary categorical response variable Y, which can take two values: 0 and 1. Instead of using Y directly as the response, we use the logit of Y, denoted as g(Y), in the regression equation. The logit function is defined as the logarithm of the odds of the positive outcome: g(Y) = ln(Y / (1 — Y)) In logistic regression, we assume that the logit of Y is linearly related to the predictors: g(Y) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + … + βnXn Here, β0, β1, β2, …, βn are the regression coefficients, and X1, X2, …, Xn are the predictors. Through this transformation, we can apply traditional regression techniques to estimate the coefficients and make predictions based on the log-odds of the positive outcome. Now, we can do the implementation simply as following. Start with the equation: Apply the exponential function to both sides to eliminate the logarithm and follow the general mathematics: Here the final equation is called as Sigmoid function(Logistic function or inverse logit). Also we can consider it as the hypothesis function(h(X)=p) Following is the generalized equation for sigmoid function(σ(z)=h(X)=p) Here z = y In the logistic regression we classify data using this Sigmoid function. Now we have the full understanding of the logistic regression and how it works. The decision boundary is a concept used in machine learning to separate different classes or categories in a classification problem. It is a mathematical representation of the dividing line or surface that separates the data points belonging to different classes. The sigmoid function, specifically the logistic sigmoid function, is often used as an activation function in binary classification problems. It maps the input values to a range between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. In the context of classification, the sigmoid function is typically used to transform a linear combination of features and their corresponding weights into a probability value. If the resulting probability is above a certain threshold (often 0.5), the data point is classified into one class, and if it is below the threshold, it is classified into the other class. The decision boundary, in this case, is the line or surface in the input space where the probability of belonging to one class is equal to the probability of belonging to the other class. In a binary classification problem, this decision boundary is often at a probability threshold of 0.5. In other words, when the sigmoid function output is above 0.5, the data point is classified as one class, and when the sigmoid function output is below 0.5, the data point is classified as the other class. The decision boundary is the boundary in the input space where the sigmoid function output is exactly 0.5. It’s important to note that the relationship between the decision boundary and the sigmoid function is not always linear. The decision boundary can be linear or nonlinear depending on the complexity of the problem and the model used. In more complex cases, where a linear decision boundary is insufficient, other activation functions or more complex models may be used to capture nonlinear decision boundaries. The cost function, also known as the loss function, is used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model. In logistic regression we use log loss(binary cross-entropy) as the cost function. It quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. Cost function is derived from the negative log-likelihood function, which is the logarithm of the likelihood function. The goal is to minimize the cost function, indicating a better fit of the model to the data(minimize the cross-entropy loss to find the optimal parameters for the logistic regression model). Mathematically, the cross-entropy loss function for binary logistic regression is given by: Here, J(θ) represents the cross-entropy loss, m is the number of data points, yi​ is the actual binary outcome (0 or 1) for the ith data point, and y^​i​ is the predicted probability of the positive outcome for the ith data point. The likelihood function measures the goodness of fit of the model by quantifying the probability of observing the given set of outcomes (binary responses) given the predictor variables. Mathematically, the likelihood function is defined as the product of the probabilities of observing the actual outcomes (y_i) for each data point (i) in the dataset, given the predicted probabilities (p_i) from the logistic regression model: Here, p_i represents the predicted probability of the positive outcome for data point i, and y_i is the actual outcome, either 0 or 1. Gradient descent is used as an optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameter values that maximize the likelihood(minimize cost). Minimizing the cost function is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the observed outcomes. Lets try to visualize above metrices using a simple dataset which has single feature and 2 classes. (You can find the full code in my GitHub.) Try to compare these plots with above explained theories. Also you can clearly observe the cost is minimized when it reaches 0 or 1(values of two classes). Sigmoid curve(hypothesis function) represent the probabilities for each data point. We can plot the cost against the trainings. After each training, the cost should be decreased. Then the graph should looks like following. If the plot has above behaviour, then it can be considered as a better one. Also, we can use following metrices to evaluate the model. Let’s assume we already predicted the probabilities for the existing set of values(labels). We can use following code to calculate the metrices. Let’s evaluate them. (You can find the full code in my GitHub.) Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions. It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. In this case, the accuracy is approximately 0.511, indicating that around 51.1% of the predictions were correct. Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions. In this case, the precision is approximately 0.536, indicating that around 53.6% of the positive predictions were correct. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It measures the ability of the model to identify positive instances. In this case, the recall is approximately 0.494, indicating that around 49.4% of the actual positive instances were correctly identified. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced measure that considers both precision and recall. In this case, the F1 score is approximately 0.514, indicating a trade-off between precision and recall. The confusion matrix is a table that shows the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The matrix shows that there are 252 true negatives (predicted negative and actually negative), 224 false positives (predicted positive but actually negative), 265 false negatives (predicted negative but actually positive), and 259 true positives (predicted positive and actually positive). The AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) score measures the model’s ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances across different classification thresholds. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0.5 represents a random classifier and 1 represents a perfect classifier. In this case, the AUC-ROC score is approximately 0.505, indicating a weak classifier that performs only slightly better than random guessing. These evaluation metrics provide insights into the performance of the binary classification model. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to evaluate the model’s performance, while the confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the predictions. The AUC-ROC score measures the overall discriminatory power of the model. Now we have learned all the basic concepts of binary logistic regression. What if the behaviour of the data is not binary(have several classes)? In this case we use multiclass logistic regression Multiclass logistic regression with softmax activation is an extension of binary logistic regression that allows us to classify data into more than two classes. It is a popular algorithm used in machine learning for multi-class classification problems. To understand multiclass logistic regression, let’s first review the basics of logistic regression. Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an input belonging to a particular class. It uses the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to model the relationship between the input features and the binary output. The logistic function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probability estimation. The logistic regression model can be represented as: logit(p) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + … + βₚxₚ Here, logit(p) is the log-odds of the probability p of the positive class, β₀ is the intercept term, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ are the coefficients for the input features x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ. To extend logistic regression to multiclass classification, we use the softmax activation function instead of the sigmoid function. The softmax function generalizes the sigmoid function to multiple classes and outputs a probability distribution over all classes. It ensures that the predicted probabilities sum up to 1. The softmax function can be defined as follows: softmax(zᵢ) = exp(zᵢ) / Σⱼ(exp(zⱼ)) Here, zᵢ represents the logit for class i, and zⱼ represents the logit for class j. The softmax function exponentiates the logits and normalizes them by dividing each exponentiated value by the sum of all exponentiated values. In multiclass logistic regression, we aim to learn the coefficients β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ for each class, similar to binary logistic regression. The model predicts the probability of an input belonging to each class and assigns it to the class with the highest probability. To illustrate multiclass logistic regression, let’s consider a simple example with two input features (x₁ and x₂) and three classes. (You can find the full code in my GitHub.) The code above generates a random dataset with two input features (x₁ and x₂) and assigns labels 0, 1, and 2 to three classes. The scatter plot visualizes the data points with different colours representing each class. To perform multiclass logistic regression, we can utilize libraries like scikit-learn in Python. Here’s an example using scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression class with softmax activation: (You can find the full code in my GitHub.) The code above creates a LogisticRegression model with the 'multinomial' option for multi-class classification and uses the 'lbfgs' solver to optimize the model parameters. The model is then trained on the input features X and their corresponding labels y. Finally, the decision boundaries are plotted along with the data points as following. This example demonstrates how multiclass logistic regression with softmax activation extends the binary logistic regression concept to handle multiple classes. The softmax function enables us to obtain a probability distribution over all classes, and the model predicts the class with the highest probability for each input. Keep in mind that this is just a simple illustration, and in practice, you may encounter more complex datasets with higher-dimensional features. However, the underlying principles of multiclass logistic regression and softmax activation remain the same. "

With its simplicity and effectiveness, it has become a go-to method for predicting binary outcomes. In this article, we will delve into the logistics of the logistic regression algorithm, exploring its underlying principles, advantages, and limitations. Logistic regression is a statistical algorithm used for binary classification, which means it predicts outcomes that belong to one of two possible classes. These classes can be as diverse as “yes/no,” “true/false,” “spam/not spam,” or any other dichotomous categorization. Despite its name, logistic regression is not used for regression (predicting continuous values) but rather for classification problems. More specifically: It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. The name “logistic regression” comes from the function used in the model, which is called the logistic function or sigmoid function. The logistic function is a mathematical function that takes any input value and returns an output value between 0 and 1. The name “logistic” comes from the term “logit”, which is the logarithm of the odds of an event occurring. In logistic regression, the logit of the probability is modeled as a linear combination of the independent variables, and then the logistic function is applied to the result to obtain the predicted probability. In summary, the name “logistic regression” refers to the use of the logistic function to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of an event occurring. At its core, logistic regression is based on the principle of using a logistic function, also known as a sigmoid function, to model the relationship between the independent variables and the predicted output. The logistic function takes any real-valued number and squashes it to a value between 0 and 1, mapping it to a probability. To build a logistic regression model, we start by collecting a labeled dataset consisting of multiple instances, each with its corresponding binary outcome. We then calculate the probability of an instance belonging to one class using the following formula: P(class = 1) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + … + βnx_n))) In this equation, P(class = 1) represents the probability of the instance belonging to class 1, x1 to xn are the independent variables (also known as features) associated with the instance, and β0 to βn represent the regression coefficients that determine the influence of each feature on the outcome. The logistic formula calculates a weighted combination of features and applies the sigmoid function to produce a probability estimate. Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function): Training a logistic regression model involves finding the optimal values for the β coefficients that best fit the training data. This is achieved through an iterative process known as maximum likelihood estimation or gradient descent, where the algorithm adjusts the coefficients based on the errors between predicted probabilities and actual class labels. The model continues to update the coefficients until convergence, minimizing the error and improving prediction accuracy. 2. Flexibility: Despite being primarily designed for binary classification, logistic regression can be extended to handle multiclass problems by using techniques such as one-vs-rest or softmax regression. 3. Efficient on small datasets: Logistic regression is known for its efficiency in scenarios where the number of features is relatively small compared to the sample size. It can provide reliable predictions even with limited data. In conclusion, the logistic regression algorithm provides a powerful and interpretable approach to binary classification problems. Its ease of use, flexibility, and efficiency make it an indispensable tool for data scientists and practitioners alike. However, like any algorithm, it has its limitations and assumptions that need to be carefully considered when applying it to real-world scenarios.

One of the key components of logistic regression is the cost function, which quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. This blog post will provide a comprehensive explanation of the logistic regression cost function, its importance, and how it is calculated. Before delving into the details of the cost function, let’s first understand what logistic regression is and its significance in machine learning. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is primarily used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, based on the input features. In logistic regression, the goal is to find the optimal parameters that minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels. This is where the cost function comes into play. The cost function helps us measure how well our model is performing and guides us toward finding the optimal parameters. In the previous tutorial, you saw the logistic regression model to train the parameters W and B, of a logistic regression model. You need to define a cost function, let’s take a look at the cost function. The logistic regression cost function, also known as the log loss or cross-entropy loss, is a measure of the error between the predicted probabilities and true class labels.The logistic regression cost function is also known as the cross-entropy loss function or the log loss function. It is a convex function, which means that it has a single global minimum. This makes it easier to optimize using gradient descent. You can use to train logistic regression to recap this is what we have defined from the previous tutorial. So you output Y hat is sigmoid of W transports experts be where sigmoid of Z is as defined here. So to learn parameters for your model, you’re given a training set of training examples and it seems natural that you want to find parameters W and B. So that at least on the training set, the outputs you have the predictions you have on the training set, which I will write as y hat I that that will be close to the ground troops labels y I that you got in the training set. So to fill in a little bit more detail for the equation on top, we had said that y hat as defined at the top for a training example X. And of course for each training example, we’re using these superscripts with round brackets with parentheses to index into different train examples. Your prediction on training example I which is y hat I is going to be obtained by taking the sigmoid function and applying it to W transposed X I the input for the training example plus B. And you can also define Z I as follows where Z I is equal to, you know, W transport Z I plus B. So throughout this course we’re going to use this notational convention that the super strip parentheses I refers to data be an X or Y or Z. Or something else associated with the I’ve training example associated with the life example, okay, that’s what the superscript I in parenthesis means. Now let’s see what loss function or an error function we can use to measure how well our album is doing. One thing you could do is define the loss when your algorithm outputs y hat and the true label is y to be maybe the square error or one half a square error. It turns out that you could do this, but in logistic regression people don’t usually do this. Because when you come to learn the parameters, you find that the optimization problem, which we’ll talk about later becomes non convex. So you end up with optimization problem, you’re with multiple local optima. So great in dissent, may not find a global optimum, if you didn’t understand the last couple of comments, don’t worry about it, Ww’ll get to it in a later video. But the intuition to take away is that dysfunction L called the loss function is a function will need to define to measure how good our output y hat is when the true label is y. And squared era seems like it might be a reasonable choice except that it makes great in descent not work well. So in logistic regression were actually define a different loss function that plays a similar role as squared error but will give us an optimization problem that is convex. And so we’ll see in a later video becomes much easier to optimize, so what we use in logistic regression is actually the following loss function, which I’m just going right out here is negative. y log y hat plus 1 minus y log 1 minus, y hat here’s some intuition on why this loss function makes sense. Keep in mind that if we’re using squared error then you want to square error to be as small as possible. And with this logistic regression, lost function will also want this to be as small as possible. To understand why this makes sense, let’s look at the two cases, in the first case let’s say y is equal to 1, then the loss function. y hat comma Y is just this first term right in this negative science, it’s negative log y hat if y is equal to 1. Because if y equals 1, then the second term 1 minus Y is equal to 0, so this says if y equals 1, you want negative log y hat to be as small as possible. So that means you want log y hat to be large to be as big as possible, and that means you want y hat to be large. But because y hat is you know the sigmoid function, it can never be bigger than one. So this is saying that if y is equal to 1, you want, y hat to be as big as possible, but it can’t ever be bigger than one. So saying you want, y hat to be close to one as well, the other case is Y equals zero, if Y equals 0. Then this first term in the loss function is equal to 0 because y equals 0, and in the second term defines the loss function. So the loss becomes negative Log 1 minus y hat, and so if in your learning procedure you try to make the loss function small. What this means is that you want, Log 1 minus y hat to be large and because it’s a negative sign there. And then through a similar piece of reasoning, you can conclude that this loss function is trying to make y hat as small as possible, and again, because y hat has to be between zero and 1. This is saying that if y is equal to zero then your loss function will push the parameters to make y hat as close to zero as possible. Now there are a lot of functions with roughly this effect that if y is equal to one, try to make y hat large and y is equal to zero or try to make y hat small. We just gave here in green a somewhat informal justification for this particular loss function we will provide an optional video later to give a more formal justification for y. In logistic regression, we like to use the loss function with this particular form. Finally, the last function was defined with respect to a single training example. It measures how well you’re doing on a single training example, I’m now going to define something called the cost function, which measures how are you doing on the entire training set. So the cost function j, which is applied to your parameters W and B, is going to be the average, really one of the m of the sun of the loss function apply to each of the training examples. In turn, we’re here, y hat is of course the prediction output by your logistic regression algorithm using, you know, a particular set of parameters W and B. And so just to expand this out, this is equal to negative one of them, some from I equals one through of the definition of the lost function above. So this is y I log y hat I plus 1 minus Y, I log 1minus y hat I I guess it can put square brackets here. So the minus sign is outside everything else, so the terminology I’m going to use is that the loss function is applied to just a single training example. Like so and the cost function is the cost of your parameters, so in training your logistic regression model, we’re going to try to find parameters W and B. That minimize the overall cost function J, written at the bottom. So you’ve just seen the setup for the logistic regression algorithm, the loss function for training example, and the overall cost function for the parameters of your algorithm. It turns out that logistic regression can be viewed as a very, very small neural network. In the next tutorial, we’ll go over that so you can start gaining intuition about what neural networks do. So with that let’s go on to the next video about how to view logistic regression as a very small neural network. The logistic regression cost function possesses several desirable properties that make it suitable for training binary classifiers. These properties include: 1. Convexity The cost function is convex, meaning it has a single global minimum. This allows us to use optimization algorithms like gradient descent to find the optimal parameters. 2. Continuous and Differentiable The cost function is continuous and differentiable, which enables us to use gradient-based optimization techniques to minimize it efficiently. 3. Monotonicity As we update the model parameters to minimize the cost function, it leads to an increase in model performance and a decrease in prediction errors. The lower the cost function value, the better the model is fitting the training data.

We have seen how it measures the error between predicted probabilities and true class labels, and why it is crucial for training binary classifiers.

In this article, we’ll explore the concept of linear regression, one of the fundamental models in machine learning, and how it can be used to predict house prices. We’ll dive into the basics of supervised learning, the components of a linear regression model, and the importance of cost functions in training these models. Supervised learning is a popular approach in machine learning where a model learns from a labeled dataset. In this case, the dataset consists of input features (such as the size of a house) and corresponding output targets (the actual price of the house). The goal is to train the model to make accurate predictions based on new inputs. Linear regression is a widely used learning algorithm that involves fitting a straight line to a dataset. Imagine having a dataset of house sizes and prices from a city like Portland, USA. By plotting the data points on a graph, with house size on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis, you can visualize the relationship between the two variables. To predict the price of a house based on its size, a linear regression model is built. The model fits a straight line to the data points, aiming to capture the underlying trend. By extending this line, you can estimate the price for a given house size. Linear regression falls under the category of regression models, as it predicts numerical values, such as house prices in dollars. To train the linear regression model, a training set is used. The training set comprises pairs of input features (eg: square feet) and corresponding output targets (eg: house price). Let: A specific training example is denoted as (x^i, y^i). Therefore, the equation can be written as: where each pair (x^i, y^i) represents a specific house in the dataset, and “m” denotes the number of training examples. When training the model, a learning algorithm produces a function (f) that takes an input feature (x) and outputs an estimate or prediction (ŷ). In linear regression, the function f(x) is defined as: where: A crucial aspect of linear regression is the cost function. The cost function measures the model’s performance by quantifying the difference between predicted values and actual targets. This concept is widely applicable in machine learning and plays a vital role in training advanced AI models. In the next article, we’ll delve deeper into the cost function and explore how it contributes to training linear regression models. In conclusion, linear regression is a valuable tool for predicting house prices based on specific features. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it widely used in the field of machine learning. By fitting a straight line to the data, the linear regression model can estimate the price of a house based on its size. This example demonstrates the concept of supervised learning, where the model is trained using labeled data to predict numeric outputs. #MachineLearning #LinearRegression #SupervisedLearning #DataScience #PredictiveModeling "

It can be used to predict the probability of an event occurring, such as whether an incoming email is spam or not, or whether a tumor is malignant or not, based on a given labeled data set. Due to its simplicity, logistic regression is often used as a baseline against which other, more complex models are evaluated. The model has the word “logistic” in its name, since it uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to convert a linear combination of the input features into probabilities. It also has the word “regression” in its name, since its output is a continuous value between 0 and 1, although it is typically used as a binary classifier by choosing a threshold value (usually 0.5) and classifying inputs with probability greater than the threshold as the positive class, and those below the threshold as the negative class. In this article we will discuss the logistic regression model in depth, implement it from scratch in Python, and then show its implementation in Scikit-Learn. Recall that in supervised machine learning problems, we are given a training set of n labeled samples: D = {(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), … , (xₙ, yₙ)}, where xᵢ is a m-dimensional vector that contains the features of sample i, and yᵢ represents the label of that sample. Our goal is to build a model whose predictions are as close as possible to the true labels. In classification problems, the label yᵢ can take one of k values, representing the k classes to which the samples belong. More specifically, in binary classification problems, the label yᵢ can assume only two values: 0 (representing the negative class) and 1 (representing the positive class).

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ConvNets) are specialized neural architectures that are predominantly used for several computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object recognition. These neural networks harness the power of Linear Algebra, specifically through convolution operations, to identify patterns within images. Convolutional neural networks have three main kinds of layers, which are: • Convolutional layer • Pooling layer • Fully-connected layer The convolutional layer is the first layer of the network, while the fully-connected layer is the final layer, responsible for the output. The first convolutional layer may be followed by several additional convolutional layers or pooling layers; and with each new layer, the more complex is the CNN. As the CNN gets more complex, the more it excels in identifying greater portions of the image. Whereas earlier layers focus on the simple features, such as colors and edges; as the image progresses through the network, the CNN starts to recognize larger elements and shapes, until finally reaching its main goal. The image below displays the structure of a CNN. We have an input image, followed by Convolutional and Pooling layers, where the feature learning process happens. Later on, we have the layers responsible for the task of classifying whether the vehicle in the input data is a car, truck, van, bicycle, etc. Convolutional Layer The convolutional layer is the most important layer of a CNN; responsible for dealing with the major computations. The convolutional layer includes input data, a filter, and a feature map. To illustrate how it works, let’s assume we have a color image as input. This image is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D, representing the three dimensions of the image: height, width, and depth. The filter — which is also referred to as kernel — is a two-dimensional array of weights, and is typically a 3×3 matrix. It is applied to a specific area of the image, and a dot product is computed between the input pixels and the weights in the filter. Subsequently, the filter shifts by a stride, and this whole process is repeated until the kernel slides through the entire image, resulting in an output array. The resulting output array is also known as a feature map, activation map, or convolved feature. It is important to note that the weights in the filter remain fixed as it moves across the image. The weight values are adjusted during the training process due to backpropagation and gradient descent. Besides the weights in the filter, we have other three important parameters that need to be set before the training begins: • Number of Filters: This parameter is responsible for defining the depth of the output. If we have three distinct filters, we have three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. • Stride: This is the distance, or number of pixels, that the filter moves over the input matrix. • Zero-padding: This parameter is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements outside the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three different kinds of padding: ■ Valid padding: Also known as no padding. In this specific case, the last convolution is dropped if the dimensions do not align. ■ Same padding: This padding ensures that the output layer has the exact same size as the input layer. ■ Full padding: This kind of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the borders of the input matrix. After each convolution operation, we have the application of a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, which transforms the feature map and introduces nonlinearity. As mentioned earlier, the initial convolutional layer can be followed by additional convolutional layers. The subsequent convolutional layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of the prior layers, which helps to extract and interpret additional patterns. Pooling Layer The pooling layer is responsible for reducing the dimensionality of the input. It also slides a filter across the entire input — without any weights — to populate the output array. We have two main types of pooling: • Max Pooling: As the filter slides through the input, it selects the pixel with the highest value for the output array. • Average Pooling: The value selected for the output is obtained by computing the average within the receptive field. The pooling layer serves the purpose of reducing complexity, improving efficiency, and limiting the risk of overfitting. Fully-connected Layer This is the layer responsible for performing the task classification based on the features extracted during the previous layers. While both convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLU functions, fully-connected layers use the Softmax activation function for classification, producing a probability from 0 to 1. Due to its power in image recognition tasks, CNNs have been highly effective in many fields related to Computer Vision. Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables computers to extract information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. Some common applications of computer vision today can be seen across several industries, including the following: • Social Media: Google, Meta, and Apple use these systems to identify people in a photograph, making it easier to organize photo albums and tag friends. • Healthcare: Computer vision models have been used to help doctors identify cancerous tumors in patients, as well as other conditions. • Agriculture: Drones equipped with cameras can monitor the health of vast farmlands to identify areas that need more water or fertilizers. • Security: Surveillance systems can detect unusual and suspect activities in real time. • Finance: Computer vision models may be used to identify relevant patterns in candlestick charts to predict price movements. • Automotive: Computer vision is an essential component of the research leading to self-driving cars. Nowadays, there are several pre-trained CNNs available for many tasks. Models like ResNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, as well as many others, are highly efficient in most computer vision tasks we currently perform across industries. In this article, however, I would like to explore the process of building a simple, yet effective, Convolutional Neural Network from scratch. For this task, I will use Keras to help us build a neural network that can accurately identify diseases in a plant through images. I am going to use the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset, which contains 1,530 images divided into train, test, and validation sets. The images are labeled as “Healthy“, “Rust“, and “Powdery“ to describe the conditions of the plants. Very briefly, each class means the following: • Rust: These are plant diseases caused by Pucciniales fungi, which cause severe deformities to the plant. • Powdery: Powdery mildews are caused by Erysphales fungi, posing a threat to agriculture and horticulture by reducing crop yields. • Healthy: Naturally, these are the plants that are free from diseases. Before building our Convolutional Neural Network, it is helpful to perform a brief, yet efficient, analysis of the data we have at hand. Let’s start by loading the directories for each set. We may also count the files inside each subfolder to compute the total of data we have for training and testing, as well as measure the degree of class imbalance. We have a total of 1,322 files inside the Train directory and there are no large imbalances between classes. A small variation between them is fine, and a simple metric such as Accuracy may be enough to measure performance. For the testing set, we have a total of 150 images, whereas the validation set consists of 60 images in total. Both sets have a perfect class balance. Convolutional Neural Networks require a fixed size for all images we feed into it. This means that every single image in our dataset must be equally sized, either 128×128128×128, 224×224224×224, and so on. We can also check if our data meets this requirement, or if it will be necessary to perform some preprocessing in this regard before modeling. We have 8 different dimensions across the dataset. In the next cell, I am going to check the distribution of these dimensions across the data. t seems that most images have dimensions of 4000×2672, which is a rectangular shape. We can conclude that, due to the differences in dimensions, we will need to apply some preprocessing to the data. First, we are going to resize the images, so they all have the same shape. Then, we will transform the input from rectangular shape to square shape. Another crucial consideration is verifying the pixel valye range of the images. In this case, all images should have pixel values spanning from 0 to 255. This consistency simplifies the preprocessing step, since we often normalize pixel values in images to a range going from 0 to 1. Even though not all images are of the same data type, uint8, it is fairly easy to guarantee that they will have the same data type once we load images into datasets. We confirmed, though, that all the images have pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, which is great news. Before moving on to the Preprocessing step, let’s plot some images from each class to see what they look like. For those familiar with tabular data, preprocessing is probably one of the most daunting steps of dealing with neural networks and unstructured data. This task can be fairly easy by using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory, which loads images from the directories as a TensorFlow Dataset. This resulting dataset can be manipulated for batching, shuffling, augmentating, and several other preprocessing steps. I suggest you check this link for more information on the image_dataset_from_directory function. We have successfully captured all files within each set for each of the three classes. We can also print these datasets for a further understanding of their structure. Let’s explore a bit deeper what all the information above means. • _BatchDataset: It indicates that the dataset returns data in batches. • element_spec: This describes the structure of the elements in the dataset. • TensorSpec(shape=(None, 256, 256, 3), dtype=tf.float32, name = None): This represents the features, in this case the images, in the dataset. None represents the batch size, which is None here because it can vary depending on how many samples we have in the last batch; 256, 256 represents the height and width of the images; 3 is the number of channels in the images, indicating they are RGB images. Last, dtype=tf.float32 tells us that the data type of the image pixels is a 32-bit floating point. • TensorSpec(shape=(None, 3), dtype=tf.float32, name=None): This represents the labels/targets of our dataset. Here, None refers to the batch size; 3 refers to the number of labels in the dataset; whilst dtype=tf.float32 is also a 32-bit floating point. Another important step for preprocessing is ensuring that the pixel values of our images are within a 0 to 1 range. The image_dataset_from_directory method performed some transformations already, but the pixel values are still in the 0 to 255 range. To bring the pixel values to the 0 to 1 range, we can easily use one of Keras’ preprocessing layers, tf.keras.layers.Rescaling. Now we can once more visualize the minimum and maximum pixel values in the validation set. When working with image data, it is usually a good practice to artificially introduce some diversity to the sample by applying random transformations to the images used in training. This is good because it helps to expose the model to a wider variety of images and avoids overfitting. Keras has about seven different layers for image data augmentation. These are: • tf.keras.layers.RandomCrop: This layer randomly chooses a location to crop images down to a target size. • tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip: This layer randomly flips images horizontally and or vertically based on the mode attribute. • tf.keras.layers.RandomTranslation: This layer randomly applies translations to each image during training according to the fill_mode attribute. • tf.keras.layers.RandomBrightness: This layer randomly increases/reduces the brightness for the input RGB images. • tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation: This layer randomly rotates the images during training, and also fills empty spaces according to the fill_mode attribute. • tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom: This layer randomly zooms in or out on each axis of each image independently during training. • tf.keras.layers.RandomContrast: This layer randomly adjusts contrast by a random factor during training in or out on each axis of each image independently during training. For this task, I am going to apply RandomRotation, RandomContrast, as well as RandomBrightness to our images. We can also use an input_shape as example to build the pipeline above and plot it below to illustrate how it looks. To build the Convolutional Neural Network with Keras, we are going to use the Sequential class. This class allows us to build a linear stack of layers, which is essential for the creation of neural networks. Besides the Convolutional, Pooling, and Fully-Connected Layers, which we have previously explored, I am also going to add the following layers to the network: • BatchNormalization: This layer applies a transformation that maintains the mean output close to 00 and the standard deviation close to 11. It normalizes its inputs and is important to help convergence and generalization. • Dropout: This layer randomly sets a fraction of input units to 00 during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. • Flatten: This layer transforms a multi-dimensional tensor into a one-dimensional tensor. It is used when transitioning from the Feature Learning segment — Convolutional and Pooling layers — to the fully-connected layers. I plan to use different kernel sizes, both 3×33×3 and 5×55×5. This may allow the network to capture features at multiple scales. I am also gradually increasing the dropout rates as we advance through the process and the increase in the number of kernels. With that being said, let’s go ahead and build our ConvNet. • optimizer: In this parameter, we define the algorithms to adjust the weight updates. This is an important parameter, because choosing the right optimizer is essential to speed convergence. We are going to use RMSprop, which is the best optimizer I've found during the tests I ran. • loss: This is the loss function we’re trying to minimize during training. In this case, we are using categorical_crossentropy, which is a good choice for classification tasks with over two classes. • metrics: This parameter defines the metric that will be used to evaluate performance during training and validation. Since our data is not heavily unbalanced, we may use accuracy for this, which is a very straightforward metric given by the following formula: After compiling the model, I am going to define an Early Stopping and a Model Checkpoint. Early Stopping serves the purpose of interrupting the training process when a certain metric stops improving over a period of time. In this case, I am going to configure the EarlyStopping method to monitor the accuracy in the test set, and stop the training process if we don't have any improvement on it after 5 epochs. Model Checkpoint will ensure that only the best weights get saved, and we’re also going to define the best weights according to the accuracy of the model in the test set. We may now use model.fit() to start the training and testing process. The highest accuracy for the testing set has been reached at the 22nd epoch at 0.9600, or 96%, and didn’t improve after that. With the history object, we can plot two lineplots showing both the loss function and accuracy for both sets over epochs. It is possible to see that the loss of the training set decreases continuously over epochs, whereas its accuracy increases. This happens because, at each epoch, the model starts to become more and more aware of the training set’s patterns and particularities. For the test set, however, this process is a bit more slower. Overall, the lowest loss for the test set happened at epoch 14 at 0.5319, while the accuracy was at its peak at epoch 22, at 0.9600. Now that our model is built, trained, and tested, we can also plot its architecture, as well as summary to better understand it. In the image, it is possible to visualize the sequential process of the Convolutional Neural Network. First we have a 2D Convolutional Layer, with ReLU activation function, followed by a BatchNormalization Layer and then a MaxPooling 2D Layer. Finally, we have a Dropout Layer to avoid overfitting. This same pattern repeats a few times until we reach the Flatten Layer, which connects the output of the Feature Learning process to the Dense Layers for the final classification task. Using model.summary(), we can extract some extra info on the neural network. The summary displays the output shapes for each layer, as well as the number of parameters. We can clearly see, for instance, that the output shape for the first layer is (None, 256,256,3) where 256,256 represents both height and width, while 3 represents the RGB color. In the last dense layer, however, the output shape is (None, 3), where 3 represents the three classes for classification. We can also see that the model has over 69 million parameters, where 99.99% of them are trainable. The non-trainable parameters are the ones from the BatchNormalization layers. After finishing the training and testing phase, we may go ahead and validate our model on the validation set. To load the best weights achieved during training, we simply use the load_weights method. These weights will be saved with the same name we've given during the ModelCheckpoint configuration, when we set ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5'). The output for model.predict() consists of probabilities for each class, while model.evaluate() returns loss and accuracy values. It is clear that the model correctly predicts 97% of the labels of the images in the validation set. I am going to load some images from the validation test and run predictions on them individually, so we can see how the model performs according to each picture. The model is about 99.9% confident that the plant in the picture belongs to the Powdery class, which is correct. The model is 100% certain that the plant in the picture belongs to the Rust class, which is also correct. The model is 100% certain that the plant in the picture belongs to the Healthy class, which is also correct. After running several tests with other pictures, I could identify that the current model is performing fairly well in classifying all the three classes. To save the current weights, so you can deploy this model or continue working with it later on, you can simply use Keras’ .save() method. This is going to save your model as an HDF5 file. In this article, we explored the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks. We delved deeper into the main layers — Convolutional, Pooling, etc. — , activation functions, as well as many other techniques to work with image data and CNNs for image classification. Even though many tasks nowadays can be efficiently done with pre-trained models, that can be easily accessible via platforms such as TensorFlow Hub and HuggingFace, it is still essential to understand what is the role of each layer inside a Convolutional Neural Network and how they interact with each other. This is why this article has the intention of guiding you through the process of building a CNN from scratch, and I plan to bring more notebooks such as this one for other Deep Learning tasks and architectures. Our model scored 97.0% in accuracy while predicting labels for the validation dataset, which is a great performance, and it was competent to identify relevant patterns across all the classes in the dataset. I hope that this article serves as an introduction to those that are still just starting to explore ConvNets, or even help veterans to refine their knowledge on some of the basics. Please, feel free to copy this notebook and edit it as you wish, specially to try your own improvements for higher performance and testings. Thank you so much for reading.

The event marked the first time that the team hosted an AMA event in their own Telegram group . Thousands of AMPT supporters showed up to participate in the question-answer engagement. Venue: Amplify Community Date: September 21, 2021 There were a healthy mix of questions from various topics and sourced from multiple platforms. It was also the first time we have seen or heard from Anton! Check out the transcript below to see what you missed! GUESTS: GIORGIA & ANTON HOST: ALEXANDER Section 1: Intro and Predetermined Questions Section 2: Questions from Twitter Section 3: Community Questions and Winners Announced. 150 USDT total prize pool for AMA winners. Section 1: Intro and Predetermined Questions Alexander: Okay guys, lets go ahead and begin, we will be muting the group for the first sections, then later we will open the floor for community questions. Anton Golub: Hello everyone! It’s a pleasure to be part of the AMA and looking forward to a great discussion. Alexander: Welcome Giorgia Pellizzari and Anton Golub, thank you for joining us today for this AMA with AMPT Protocol. Let’s begin with some introductions. Giorgia, can you tell everyone a little about yourself and your role with AMPT? Giorgia Pellizzari: Sure thing! My name is Giorgia Pellizzari and I am a former corporate profile that went the “startup way” almost 6 years ago. My passion for technology and building digital products led me to embrace a steep learning curve when I moved to Hong Kong and lead teams of designers and developers to launch mobile applications. We worked with great companies such as Apple and Spotify and got more and more passionate about new technologies. Blockchain and decentralized applications were natural areas of interest for me since 2016, which led me to found Holdex, where we provided token issuers with a compliant technology to raise funds safely. Today, besides being an active member of The Fintech Association of Hong Kong and Women in Tech Hong Kong, I help new projects become a reality and I’m incredibly excited to be a founding member for Amplify. Alexander: Excellent Giorgia Pellizzari thank you for that. Amplify is surely grateful to have you on board. If you could just indicate ‘done’ when you have finished your responses that would be helpful. Anton Golub: Greetings to the whole AMPT community! My name is Anton Golub , I’m the founder and CEO of Flovtec, a Swiss technology company providing market making solutions to digital asset exchanges, token issuers & protocols to create a liquid and efficient market. I also co-founded Trust Square AG, a pre-eminent blockchain technology hub located in Zurich’s financial district. I co-founded Lykke Corp, a blockchain-powered exchange to trade all assets with zero fees, where I was a Chief Science Officer. Prior to Lykke, I worked as a quantitative researcher at Olsen Ltd (successor to Olsen & Associates, founded in 1985), a boutique investment firm that pioneered the field of high-frequency trading. As a Marie Curie Research Fellow at the Alliance Manchester Business School, I worked on high-frequency trading, market microstructure and flash crashes. In 2011, I was invited to participate in the Foresight Project — The Future of Computer Trading in Financial Markets, an international project on algorithmic trading funded by HM Treasury in the UK. I have also been involved in several research projects backed by the European Union (EU) and was in the Supervisory Board for the BigDataFinance project funded through Horizon 2020. Together with my colleagues, I have co-authored 13 academic papers and two books. I have known Eugene, the CEO & Founder of AMPT for several years now and I was delighted when he invited me to join the Advisory Board, where I will support the project with topics around liquidity, market-making, exchange listings and scaling the project! I’m super excited to help the team & whole community to make the project a success. Alexander: Those areas you mentioned are vital to the success of any projects, specifically liquidity, exchange listings and of course scaling as well — so your contributions are vital. Thanks for the intro Anton. Giorgia Pellizzari, let’s begin with you. Giorgia Pellizzari: Ready! Giorgia Pellizzari: I think this is because we act like a bridge between DeFi and the real world — and people feel we are connectors. Very often there is a gap between more traditional financial products and services, and the way DeFi operates. We want DeFi to resonate more and more with the world around us and the many use cases that could benefit from it. We think our community is really in sync with this mindset and supports the obvious win-win that we are proposing with AMPT: earn high and stable interest on stablecoins and help small businesses facing their cash flow hurdles. We think that this is very relatable and our community is with us on this — how many small business owners we may have in this very chat?!?!?! Alexander: The support amongst the community has been incredible lately, and this extends beyond just community events, it’s also helpful in attracting partners and exchanges and various other aspects so it’s another critical part of the success. Grateful to have such a vast number of community members in Telegram and across the other socials. Anton Golub: First, I would like to say that I have huge respect for Eugene, the CEO of AMPT, the team he managed to get together with him and his track record in the business world. I had the privilege to get to know Eugene better over the last years and I am very impressed with his skills, experience and passion. He approaches building AMPT to become a successful project. Hence, from a personal perspective it was clear to help him & support AMPT in the next phase of growth. Secondly, as Georgia mentioned, supporting SME & small businesses with liquidity, while opening up the financing industry to a wider community is a very worthwhile goal that has a clear business case & proposition in our industry. The gap between the new world (decentralized finance) and traditional finance has to be closed, and AMPT has the opportunity to be a strong ecosystem player in the development of that vision. I look forward to seeing the next steps & success of the team. Alexander: Eugene is an excellent leader indeed. He has been a great mentor to me as well and his experience is unparalleled. It’s very enriching working with him everyday. Grateful to have him with us of course. Giorgia and Anton as well. Thanks for that. Moving on to Giorgia. Alexander: Why is the traditional financial world not catering for the same customers as Amplify? Giorgia: Great question. This answer is as simple as it is unsurprising: because it is not profitable for them. Instead of figuring out a way — through digitalization and innovation — to cater for a larger number of customers, very often financial institutions put small businesses through long, inefficient processes that very often result in rejections. We believe they could cater for this type of clients but they just prefer to stick with the big ones — easier and more money to be made there. As sad as this is, it is fine for us because it gives us a reason for driving Amplify forward with all we got! Alexander: Yes I have spoken with many small business owners and the troubles they experience with the centralized financial institutions is always a frequent topic. A solution is very much needed there. Alexander: let’s travel into the future and imagine DeFi, say, 1 year from now: what will we see? Anton: Decentralized applications are the future of finance and will completely reshape how we conduct business! The key innovation of the blockchain industry is the open, transparent, free and inclusive environment where small & medium sized businesses have the same quality, scope and scale of services that are today typically reserved for mega corporations, banks and extremely wealthy people. The future I see — and imagine — is the one, where every individual or business has the ability & ease to rapidly grow, scale and accelerate their business, execute their ideas and vision with ease, all while paying very low fees and having ample liquidity. AMPT has the potential to be a key stakeholder & player in that future and I’m extremely excited to see DeFi applications — like AMPT — being accessible to everyone around the world. The future is bright and I’m extremely happy to be a part of it — onwards and upwards! Alexander: The future is bright for sure and we are still at a very early stage with incredible growth ahead, without a doubt. Thanks Anton. That concludes the first section. Next, we gathered some questions from our twitter post on the event. If we choose your question, you will be contacted via DM on twitter to get your payment address so that you can receive your portion of the 150 USDT prize pool. So let’s begin!!! @xrypton1te asked; is this the first platform that introduces real world assets into the defi ecosystem? Giorgia: I would say: most likely not. But you know what? It doesn’t matter that much. This space is still so young and there is so much room for innovation, tokenization of a wide range of assets and variation of decentralized versions of so many use cases. We don’t even realize how privileged we all are in a way to be in this space and witness this evolution of finance so closely. This is why we don’t worry so much about being first and the only one — the more the merrier as long as real value is generated for the users! @lilsulung asked; for liquidity providers, will there be benefits in the future, such as community airdrops for liquidity providers and others? Anton: When projects launch their DeFi platform or issue their token, one of the first learning experiences is that liquidity is the lifeblood of the new, decentralized financial world! Every project needs liquidity and it needs a lot of it — the more the better. Projects that manage to motivate & galvanize a wide community to contribute to liquidity provision are the ones that have a higher & better chance of being a success. The management of Amplify Protocol has a lot of experience in the blockchain industry, and I work constantly with Eugene, the CEO of AMPT, to find the best ways to enable rapid growth of liquidity for the project. It is clear AMPT will need the support of it’s community to provide liquidity and there have to be the right incentives, both to add liquidity and to be a stakeholder for Amplify Protocol’s token. I look forward to the exciting developments Amplify Protocol has in mind for the community, that will help this project scale liquidity very rapidly and efficiently. Be on a look-out for the exciting news ahead! Alexander: Okay moving on to the last section. We will open up the floor for questions and select a few to respond and receive a portion of the 150 prize pool. Wesley CSE (@cselivings): I want to support your project. Tell us more about the Ambassador Program and in what ways can we participate? Giorgia: Thank you for asking this question! Yes we have a program and yes we want everybody that believes in what we do to work with us. It won’t be volunteering, of course. You will get paid and get an opportunity to work on truly innovative stuff! Reach out to us via our social channels and tell us what you are good at — we will do our best to find a spot for you! Alexander: Congrats Wesley! you’re among the winners, please be ready for DM from me after the event. Alex Milaer (@alextsiling): Is Amplify in contact with venture capital firms in order to fund amplify and help with marketing awareness, if not what are your plans with funding your project? Anton: AMPT team has a lot of experience in both traditional & blockchain industry and they are in discussions with key players & investors in order to get the right stakeholders involved. Likewise, the advisory board as well makes relevant introductions to Eugene so he can evaluate what is the right fit for AMPT’s success. As the project grows, the interest of investors increases and prepares it for a financing round, both on equity & token side. Alexander: Anton Golub thanks for that.Congrats Alex, i’ll dm you directly after the event to get your address! Giorgia Pellizzari, one last question to select. Ariana (@arianahifi): Do you have AUDIT certificates, or are you working to AUDIT your project, to make it more secure and reliable??? Giorgia: Of course, an audit is a must!. I have two points to say regarding security and hacks though: first — you never know if the hacker had any inside information. And the second — run an audit with a solid and reputable cybersecurity specialist. In other words, we mitigate the risk by taking cybersecurity seriously. Including completing audits of our software by third parties whose sole responsibility is to detect and report smart-contracts vulnerabilities. And by the way, for the bug hunting enthusiasts, we have a bounty program. If you are a bug hunter — reach out directly and we will share the details. Alexander: Audits are on the way guys! we guarantee it! Group has been unmuted. I’ll reach out in just a moment to retrieve your address. Giorgia: What an awesome AMA — great questions overall! Alexander: Thank you to Anton Golub and Giorgia Pellizzari for spending the last hour with us all, and of course thanks to the community for participation. Giorgia: So delighted to hang out here. Thanks to our great community — we wouldn’t be where we are without you! Alexander: Winners, congrats to you!! I will be reaching out right now on telegram and twitter to get your information so we can get those rewards sent over. We will post the transaction IDs in the chat so that there is transparency, and to make sure everyone receives their rewards! wooot woot!!! thanks ALL. It is assuring to know that the Amplify Protocol has been able to attract talents from different industries and all walks of life. The relation between the co-founders, team, advisors and the community is cordial. The project use case is going to bring DeFi closer to several thousands of small scale businesses in the next few years. The AMA session addressed important issues like DeFi security, liquidity and future adoption of Amplify Protocol.

Hello everyone🙏🏼 Good Afternoon Everyone! Please help me welcome AMPLIFY CEO Eugene Tan and Amplify CTO Vadim Zolotokrylin for the AMA today. It’s a pleasure of having you @AMPTet, @zolotokrylin here👋🏻🙏🏼 hi Velas Community, thank you for having us here you guys ready? yes Now lets start with the AMA🔥🔥 Q1. Before we discuss further about Amplify, let’s talk about yourself, also how did you build Amplify and how would you describe it? For myself, I have been in touch with B2B and blockchain for past 4 years and seeing. the evolution of digital economy Given the opportunity and with likeminded co -founders, we decided to go for it. The journey has not been easy but has been fruitful. Not for any other thing, the experience alone is rewarding Thanks, @DarkLEOJ I am CTO and co-founder of Amplify. Currently, I am responsible for Amplify product management and development. We help small and medium companies to access alternative financing services. Basically, through our platform, we help companies to grow their business. That was a fantastic journey @AMPTet. You have a great team with vast experience. Thanks @zolotokrylin Now lets move to the next question❤️ Q2. What did you consider before making a partnership with Velas for the development of your platform? A good one :) There are a few things. First of all, we were looking for a faster and cheaper chain than Ethereum, but at the same time compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. Basically, we were looking for an alternative EVM chain. So Velas fitted great for this purpose. The second factor was the fact that the Velas team is very responsive, friendly, and helpful. In contrast, some other well knows EVM chain teams are very indifferent and not very responsive. We are a startup, and time is essential for us, so we decided to vest our efforts into Velas integration. Thanks to Velas team for their support:) if I may add here, we also considered the experience and proven success record of the team. That was a great decisions. We appreciated it🙏🏼 Gas fee right now is pumping😁 100% agreed🙏🏼 You guys ready for the 3rd question? yes sir Q3. You have an amazing team. How does Amplify work? What makes it different with other competitors? And to add: there are products which are in the same niche, but they are none-inclusive for both sides of the market: liquidity providers and SMEs. That make sense, very impressive. Now lets move to the last question for the segment 1. Q5. What is your strategy for building a strong community? Do you agree that the power of the community will lead Amplify to develop globally? What services do you provide to the community? - Constant engagement with the community and deliver what is being promised. - Yes, we firmly believe that. and hence our business model of a B2B2C model where is dependent on community to succeed. Not only do we provide the community an opportunity to earn recurring income, we will also have community involved in roles to participate in various roles such as contributors be it in community engagement, risk audit etc . this is why the concept of open Finance and Defi comes into play vs the old centralisation model. This is possible as community gets more informed and will like to take ownership . Amplify (AMPT protocol) wants to uphold this spirit and value of inclusiveness and growing together. Additionally we are in the process of developing our ambassador program as well, so this will help mobilize influencers and anyone else whom wishes to get involved and earning some affiliate commissions. We feel strongly that the Community is the key to success for any project, including ours. Community power, I believe on it too. That’s interesting, I am sure many users will get interested of it. I wish you good luck with your plans. Thank you for the introduction @AMPTet @zolotokrylin . Now, let’s move to the Twitter Questions. There will be 5 question for you to answer, and when you are done with your answer. Please type Done, so we can move to the next question. SEGMENT 2. https://t.me/velascommunity/15821 From: @Sophiamangak Q1. What problems do you see occurring in the blockchain industry nowadays and how does your project aims to solve these problems? Besides adoption, the main problem is a lack of opportunities for crypto users to invest in high yield and low risk products. We aim to provide high yield with a low risk returns. And of course, we as a side effect we are going to contribute to overall blockchain adoption :) Thanks for this @zolotokrylin People say: Invest what you can afford to lose, maybe that is why some of the users are missing the opportunities. now lets move to the second question. From:@annamuskto Q2.Can you give us a brief description on how you plan to establish trust and accountability to investors and How to be responsible if there is a risk to investors? Few things here high level of cyber security, meaning before the protocol release our smart contracts are going to be audited by one of the best blockchain security audit firms. This means the smart contracts are going to be tested for vulnerabilities and other functional issues. Our team has experience in each aspect of the business we are running. This should give additional confidence to our supporters. Together with a security audit, we are planning to open-source all our software, so anyone can go through your application, including smart contracts, and see what it does. That will add great impact of. confidence to the community🔥🙏🏼 I beleive this is the main purpose of smtart contracts. Smart contracts make the system transparent. Yes I believe, Thanks @zolotokrylin lets move in to the 3rd one.. From: @girlofcrypt Q3. Will there be a public offering for #Amplify? How to get tokens in the fastest way in the early bird? What are incentives of $AMPT Token bring to community and investors? Yes. We are planning to run public token sale. If you want to participate as early bird, please stay tuned with updates from us. Subscribe to our news letter (on our website 3https://ampt.tec) or to our telegram group Thank you @zolotokrylin :) the pleasure is mine :) From: @Jackson04957669 Q4. Are you planning to integrate with other different blockchain technologies to expand the ecosystem and generate more trust? Yes. This has always been our blueprint. We are looking at partnerships with other chains and other applications to expand the ecosystem. This is the reason which I have said earlier question why we build on blockchain which is going to be the future of all if not most applications. we feel by building supply chain financing around with the various applications will address existing issues faced currently like scams, double pledging. This is getting more interesting😊 Thank you @AMPTet This will be. the last question for 2nd segment.Hope you guys are ready for the 3rd segment. From: @elliekingcash Q5.What does the Amplify name stand for? There are interesting stories behind every successful project, and of course you have to work hard everyday. Can you share one of these interesting stories with us? Yes, like the word Amplify means “to expand” “enlarge”. This is what we like all the stakeholders in our protocol to receive. We want to amplify the returns of our liquidity providers through the loan of their assets, likewise amplify the liquidity opportunity for the borrowers. Amplify (AMPT protocol) wants to amplify the benefits for everyone by creating a more inclusive and sustainable financing to sustain the economies. Cant really think of an interesting story to share except one where irrespective our team resident locations, we will always accommodate each others time to share and resolve challenges. For common reason is to bring this vision to fruition. We want to deliver something that makes the difference. So I urge all to join us in this journey of ampifying each other’s lives. Awesome in this place🙏🏼 Thank you for your answers @AMPTet, @zolotokrylin. Unfortunately, our second segment is Over. This is the last segment in this AMA, we really appreciate you are still with us here. We will unmute the group, and let our community ask. After that, we will mute the group again. Please pick 5 best questions. This is the last Session of this AMA. In this Session, we will unmute the chat for several minute so everyone can send their Questions to participate in the AMA. Thank you for hosting :) Thank you very much for event..pleased to be here Its my pleasure🙏🏼✅ by lending out the stablecoins, you will get the returns/rewards in the same token. at the same time, you will also be additionally rewarded with the AMPT tokens and have a stake in the protocol. the more ampt tokens. you have, you will have stronger participation in the protocol. there is no min requirement to receive the bonus there is also role of community engagement, but in beginning will be. liquidity provision to fund the borrowers. we have a good pile of borrowers with good credit rating waiting to reach out to our investors(liquidity providers) what you describe as provision stores invoices are indeed invoices but not the ones we are talking about. is at the B2B level between companies, for eg. your freight , trucking invoices and extend to raw materials invoices. And we sscale further, it can go even to big ticket like palm oil, bunker etc which is in need of financing support. hope this explains. tq for your interest. as mentioned earlier , we will be having a public fundraising soon. however, i encourage you to register your interest with our community mgr so you will be kept abreast of the token sale. for all you know, there may be special deal coming up for our great supporters. the focus is 2 pronged. one is the community engagement and build the confidence in our pdt and at the same time to roll out our MVP coming very soon. we reach out to you and join us in making the difference. TQ all for the great participation. have a good weekend. Congratulations to all winners🔥 Thanks for the participation, have a great weekend ahead😎🦾 "

https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/youre-cold-storing-or-you-re-completely-trusting-a-platform-period-7caf02ea0bdd?source=collection_home---------1----------------------------,"We’re big advocates of cold storage via Trezor or Ledger, and we’ve made no secret about it. If you haven’t obtained cold storage and have any crypto above 500 USD or EUR, stop reading this, click one of the links above, and buy one. Go ahead. We’ll be here when you come back. Ok now that you have your hardware wallet, you have one of two means of storing your digital assets. The second is absolute trust. Crypto on a Platform? Look into Their Terms of Service Should you choose to retain crypto on a centralized platform, your first course of business is to establish stated policies around ownership (should be explicitly yours) and custodianship (should be explicitly theirs). For example, here’s the relevant bit from Coinbase’s terms of service (emphasis is ours): 2.7.1. Ownership. Title to Supported Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to Coinbase. All interests in Digital Assets we hold for Digital Asset Wallets are held for customers, are not property of Coinbase, and are not subject to claims of Coinbase’s creditors. As owner of the Supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Supported Digital Assets. Coinbase shall have no liability for Supported Digital Asset fluctuations or loss. None of the Supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, Coinbase; Coinbase does not represent or treat assets in User’s Digital Assets as belonging to Coinbase. Coinbase may not grant a security interest in the Supported Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. Except as required by law, or except as provided herein, Coinbase will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate Supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet unless instructed by you. It’s worth noting the above policy is typical of exchanges, rather than farming and staking operations. The risk then, stems from cyclical and fast spinning markets leveraged by these entities to pay out your rewards. The Risks Lurking in Balance Sheets In May, Coinbase added language to its securities filings that said in a bankruptcy situation “the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors.” The bankruptcy filing of Celsius Network on Wednesday in federal court in New York means that its customers are faced with becoming unsecured creditors in that case, with limited claims only to the general bankruptcy estate and not their specific accounts. While unlikely, to understand where this goes, look to Celsuis. Court filings revealed that Celsius has a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet, consisting of $4.7 billion in customer holdings, another 800 million in liabilities outside holdings, and only $4.3 billion in assets to make good on those. Most of the 4.3 billion is illiquid. Celsius has already begun to pay off its debt to institutional creditors, leaving retail investors to likely bear the brunt of Celsius’ failing. And bear it they shall. Celsius’ lawyers have asserted that customers have transferred their title to coins to Celsius under the Terms of Use, giving up rights to the digital coins deposited in the borrow-and-earn programs. If you’re going to employ a platform, understanding terms of service is a must. Don’t scroll past the legal terms when you sign up. Read them. The Bottom Line We’re not recommending you run from your exchange (we’re not providing any financial advice here at all . We deal in education here). We are saying you should understand terms of service and understand your risk of storing crypto on platforms. If you don’t understand the risks of custody or do not wish to accept them, become familiar with a few self-custody crypto asset management options: upLink for crypto purchases. Trezor or Ledger for storage. GMX or Pika Protocol for active portfolio management, and FlourishingAI for passive portfolio management. Caveat Emptor. "

https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/last-weeks-crypto-meltdown-how-it-happened-and-what-s-next-f242a28a8026?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"We’re not the sort to sugar coat bad news here at FlourishingAI, and we won’t here either: last week was a total train wreck of a week. Let’s review last week’s crypto carnage and take stock of what’s next. Monday: Bitcoin price 22,494 USD On the heels of a weekend double-digit fall in crypto asset prices, Monday brough for a shock to the system locking up $12 billion in crypto assets under management. Crypto staking and lending platform Celsius stunned the market when it froze all withdrawals and exchanges, citing “extreme market conditions.” In a memo addressed to the crypto community, Celsius explained the decision was designed to “stabilize liquidity and operations.” Celsius previously drew scrutiny for offering yields of up to 18.63% on their deposits, with no insurance funds or regulatory safeguards. Concerns around Celsius as the very first of many collateralized Defi protocols spread quickly among the worldwide crypto community, leading to concerns of mass crypto liquidations, driving prices down further. Tuesday: Bitcoin price 22,120 USD Crypto markets appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, with bitcoin hovering at around $22,000 and ether at around $1,100. that would be short lived. Investors continued to assess the Celsius fallout while layoff and furlough announcements by crypto companies looking to conserve capital began to circulate. Coinbase was the first to announce a lay off nearly a 20% of its workforce. Coinbase previously slashed spending, paused promotions, and rescinded job offers in the pursuit of stabilization. “We had the recent inflation report that came out that I think surprised many folks,” explained President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi. “it feels like the most prudent thing to do right now”. Crypto.com followed quickly announced a 260 staff reduction, with Gemini soon following with a 10% reduction of its workforce. Crypto asset lending firm BlockFi announced a lay off totalling a fifth of its staff. While companies taking advantage of news shocks to downplay reductions in workforce is a commonplace occurrence, the scale of reductions for all three firms are unprecedented. Wednesday: Bitcoin price 22,562 USD Crypto prices rallied slightly, but that proved to be dead cat bounce. On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point in an attempt to curb inflation. The raise was the Fed’s most aggressive in 25 years. Meanwhile, CEO Michael Saylor appeared on financial television programs to address concerns Wednesday morning to discuss concerns around his firm, MicroStrategy (a large Bitcoin asset holder). MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to then buy more of the cryptocurrency. Purchases reached $4 billion. “The margin call is much ado about nothing” according to according to Saylor . “We feel like we have a fortress balance sheet, we’re comfortable, and the margin loan is well managed.” Meanwhile, MicroStrategy was not alone in leveraged crypto asset buys. Publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital purchased crypto via a credit line with Silvergate Bank. Thursday: Bitcoin price 20,369 USD Despite the public assurances, Bitcoin followed an equities selloff on Wall Street, falling to $20,000. Bitcoin’s price retrenched to its value in 2020. “I think that we’re in a long drawdown period here,” Jill Gunter, Espresso Systems co-founder & chief strategy officer, told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “I think that we’ve taken the elevator down, and I think that we, as an industry, are going to have to take the stairs back up and climb out by building real utility,” Several influencers and financial media personalities began using the team “healthy washout.” Crypto platforms continued to field insolvency questions while platforms Voyager and CakeDefi proceeding to extend lines of credit and announced repeatedly to their communities that exposure to Celsius was minimal to non-existent. Friday and Weekend: Bitcoin price 17,601.58 USD Carnage in the crypto markets accelerated, bitcoin fell as low as $17,601.58 (matching 2017 prices). Going into the (US) holiday weekend, investors remained anxious due to a torrent of negative crypto headlines and negative economic data driving prices to new lows. “We had financial instability because of this opaque leverage, you just couldn’t tell where all these risks were building up,” Paxos CEO & Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla told CNBC. CEO Alex Mashinsky had planned to be Celsius’ long running live weekly “ask me anything” (AMA) broadcast before it was canceled minutes before its scheduled time. The lack of announcements drove open speculation the days of unsustainable high yields have now given way to waves of insolvency: It’s Monday, Now What? Bitcoin price 19,920 USD as of this writing. Bitcoin hit an all time high of $69,044.77 on Nov 10, 2021. That’s a 71% drop in seven months. Bitcoin may still has more downside potential, though portfolio solutions like Flourishing AI have helped investors avoid the steep drops most have faced (the average Flourishing AI portfolio is averaging 16% down versus 71%). Queue the analysts. Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank questioned whether “Bitcoin’s weekend dip was, to put it simply, not deep enough. The macro environment has not really changed from last week’s FOMC meeting.” Meanwhile, one of Celsius Network’s earliest investors has proposed a recovery plan to help the beleaguered company: The bottom line? If Bitcoin and other crypto assets break significantly lower than 20,000 USD, we believe it’s likely another wave of liquidations is coming as markets suss out who is collateralized and who’s swimming naked. If trading continues sideways, big liquidations may be done and a base is forming (note: not financial advice). "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/does-terra-demonstrate-algorithmic-stables-dont-work-fd2358f21d18?source=collection_home---------4----------------------------,"Every algorithmic stable coin is ultimately a tokenized arms race. Terra and Luna are each halves of what was supposed to be a perpetual, algorithmic wealth machine made possible by the through the magic of financial engineering. The operative term there of course is “supposed to be”. A bit of background (skippable if you know what Terra is) TerraUSD, or UST, has been dragged into the spotlight in the last few days after the so-called stablecoin, which is supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar, fell sharply below the $1 mark. UST is an algorithmic stable coin which uses code to maintain its price at around $1 based on a complex system of minting and burning. A UST token is created by destroying some of the related cryptocurrency luna to maintain the dollar peg. In other words, both tokens are supposed to act as a balancing mechanism for each other, by which one is automatically created or destroyed based on the supply and demand of the other. What Happened? Luna was on a massive 1,000% run in recent months, mostly because it paid people to use the coin. How? well Terraform Labs (the company behind this backing from major investors like Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital) ran a lending program named Anchor, which paid users 18–20% interest, bleeding Terraform labs of liquidity. This when savings rates in the US are effectively zero and in the EU, negative. You’re probably thinking there’s a liquidity squeeze on both sides in the offing. The Luna foundation even had a plan to defend Luna and Terra: a liquidity pool funded by $1 billion from large investment firms like Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital deployable to buy up Terra in case of a bank run. If this all sounds complex, refer to a Bloomberg columnist who called the scheme “insane.” Some have called this a a Ponzi scheme Next, two investors — let’s call them “Bleakstone” and “Castle”, knowing this all operates like a Ponzi scheme, orchestrated a large withdrawal of money no one was prepared to cover. The basic plan was to borrow Bitcoin from Gemini, use the Bitcoin to but OTC and then dump UST to create a liquidity shortfall, tanking Terra, Luna, and the rest of the crypto markets. Then repay the loan with Bitcoin purchased cheaply, pocketing the difference. Here’s how the game works: At one point, while the stable coin was in free fall, Binance halted trading. Terraform Labs deployed $1.5 billion, half of it in bitcoin, and tried to bail out Terra, which got back up to 90 cents a coin on Tuesday before dropping to 38 cents on Thursday. Terra CEO Do Kwon tweeted that he was “deploying more capital,” then there was mostly silence until a Wednesday-morning thread took on a more formal tone and ended with a promise that Terra would “return.” In the meantime, Bitcoin has plunged more than 29% in the last seven days and on Thursday dropped below $26,000 to trade at its lowest level since late Dec. 2020. Tether, the world’s largest stable coin, also fell below its $1 peg on Thursday amid a broader panic in cryptocurrency markets. The carnage is severe enough to prompt Treasury secretary Janet Yellen to weigh to call for more federal regulation on stable coins. The crypto community seems to believe the government will be forced to crack down at any moment. The lesson then is algorithmic stable coin mathematics at Terra volumes isn’t robust enough to orchestrated volume operation. That does not bode well for other stable coins with lower trading volumes. "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/crypto-etfs-on-the-way-1fd7c8631742?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"The Securities Act of 1933 and it’s follow up in 1934 appear to be the ETF approval mechanism of choice for Crypto ETF filings. The merge of crypto and the traditional stock space seems to be moving along just fine. It might be slow for some, but progress is progress. While the graveyard of rejected ETF applications grows, it’s only a matter of time before more approvals start coming to life. Teucrium is on the right track with the SEC after a successful application. This begs the question: is this the right path for future ETFs? They successfully filed under the “33 Act” and the “34 Act.” Previously, the SEC approved all bitcoin futures ETFs under the “40 Act” which regulators feel more comfortable with. The submission under 33 and 34 is an incredible start towards diversity of these types of funds. We can likely expect a rise in submissions. What else can we expect to see from these applications? Looking to recent history, there was a period early on where the majority of crypto enthusiasts saw regulation as a tumultuous storm looming far in the distance. These official decisions are a new wave of normal. We’ll begin seeing more and more connections between traditional finance and crypto rolling in over the next few years. The next question: how will this affect price action? It seems the news has settled — which shouldn’t be a surprise. In the current market, it’ll take more than successful submissions to crank the price. However, this seems to be an excellent signal for accumulation. As a long term trader I plan on buying, stuffing it away, and enjoying the ride. "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/do-nfts-have-value-7b7c1b05ea81?source=collection_home---------6----------------------------,"NFTs and the broader crypto space provide an excellent look into value and how humans come to agree on it. For years the art trade has tossed around billions of dollars in the pursuit of “true value”; bids climbing higher and higher breaking new records every year. With everything from monkey pictures to real estate having success in the NFT marketplace, it’s probably obvious that something like Jack Dorsey’s first tweet would sky rocket. However, someone eventually lies at the end of the transaction chain. Sina Estavi bought Dorsey’s inaugural tweet for $2.9 millions dollars then looked to flip it for close to $50 million. The highest bid received since posting has been $3600. A cautionary tale indeed pointing to the fickle nature of speculative value assets. We could look at this ask of $50 million dollars and scoff, but is it that outrageous? I’ll also ask the following; what if we had seen the opposite result? For instance, “Man sells Jack Dorsey Tweet NFT for $50 million dollars”. Different reaction perhaps, but no less cringe inducing. The point is no real valuation guidance in the NFT space. For those looking to collect items out of pure love of collecting, it’s pretty straight forward: pay what you want. But for those looking to invest in NFTs, it’s critical to understand NFT valuation lies solely in what someone else is willing to pay for an asset with no revenue stream, legal rights, or even exclusivity. Proceed at your own risk. "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/the-curious-case-of-insider-trading-at-coinbase-7976eb35097e?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"On April 11, Coinbase’s blog published a post titled “Increasing Transparency for new asset listings on Coinbase”. While I’m not privy to internal machinations at Coinbase, I can say this is generally the kind of public relations work corporate entities often post to acknowledge impact of questionable policy without actually admitting guilt. Think of it as a “we’ll do better, so let’s just put this messy business behind us, ok?” Breaking down the post, they list a number of newly issued, relatively illiquid coins and tokens. There’s also a definition of asset types eligible for Coinbase listing: None of which addresses some of the social media activity which promoted the post. A number of observers noted buyers who were able to purchase assets pre listing, at significant discounts. As a result of this coming to light, we expect more calls for regulation. I think it’s important I take a moment to spell out FlourishingAI policy clearly: early discount purchases not widely available to the entire community is counter to our mission of democratizing crypto at FlourishingAI. I’ll present some of the social activity below, without further comment. "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/dyor-a-guide-for-the-impatient-9d2fa2c3db8e?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"“Not Financial Advice” and “DYOR” are standard messages you’ve heard on every web 3 podcast, newscast, broadcast, and written anything. Let’s be honest here: you’re ultimately in charge of your financial future (this is true even if you employ a personal financial advisor, I’d add). So how do you DYOR properly? Well, I’m happy to announce we’re working on the next iteration of FlourishingAI, which will extend its auto trading and provide user DYOR which are truly easy to use and help drive confident action rather than analysis paralysis. Until then, here’s my handy guide for DYOR on any digital asset you’re considering purchasing. If you’re new to crypto and want to get smart about researching web 3, this guide’s for you. Start your journey with big and established currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. While volatile, high trading volumes make these the safest investments in the space. Net, read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos to understand the basics. Skip the programming parts unless you’re into that. By the time you’re done, you’ll understand wallets, addresses, private and public keys, and how blockchains work. 2. Understand the Problem and Ascertain if the Project Solution is Viable. Read the Website and Whitepaper. Focus on two things: whether the project looks credible and the problems the project is trying to solve. Ask yourself if the problem is worth solving. Then determine if it makes sense to introduce blockchain technology to solve the specified problems. Finally, figure out if the team’s offering is substantially better than available alternatives (be they crypto based or not). Run a SWOT analysis. Anything not solving a problem is speculative (oh, hello SHIB). Check the project’s socials — what you’re looking for is not too frequent updates (indicating they’re only working on marketing) or too few (indicating slow advancement). 3. Understand the Tokenomics Is it a token? A coin? Know the difference. Does the project build on an existing chain or does it have its own blockchain? how are tokens issued and have a few early holders amassed a large concentration of the token already? Such concentration could be problematic if so, since the token will move a lot if a few people make moves. Also , determine the consensus algorithm of the chain a crypto project uses — and the extent of centralization or decentralization. The former isn’t necessarily bad (look at unstoppable domains), but there should be a good reason to centralize. Otherwise decentralization should be preferred. Finally, understand what exchanges they’re listed on, as a listing on an exchange (centralized or decentralized) which is too small increases risk substantially. 4. Understand the Team Is the team anonymous? An anon team doesn’t necessarily make a project a scam or rug pull, but a public team does point to confidence and transparency. Does the team have a background which makes the team suitable to handle the problem (in step 1)? Do a bit of digging on platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter to verify persons behind the project. Then reach out to the team and ask them your questions. Any team who truly believes in their mission will talk incessantly about it (our team and our community can’t shut up about making crypto accessible for new holders, for instance). 5. Join a Holder Community! Going it alone virtually guarantees failure. Try joining a community such as FlourishingAI’s community where there is data driven, respectful discussion of tokens and coins. Look for maturity of participants and the maturity of the discussion. Avoid overly hyper discussions or groups where discussion is overly loaded with memes or with repetitive posts, which is usually a good indicator of bots which are employed to provide the illusion of community. Also look for a project’s partners — a strong project will attract other strong projects which are happy to partner to create synergy. Trite but true, you are the sum of your five closest friends. The same is kind of true for projects. Ok, the above five research goals in place, I’ll end with a few final thoughts: · Not all the information will be of the same quality or trustworthiness. While you should consider all available info, place more credibility on a press release, media coverage, or partner announcement than a random tweet or reddit thread. When in doubt, consider motivations of the writer. · Consider the relevance and importance of the data. Again not all news is created equal. Coindesk and Decrypt are more relevant than press releases or project tweets. Another example: news of a data breach or safety issue regarding your investment is massively more important than a new planned feature. · DYOR takes time. Don’t rush it. These are JUST the basics. I could write dozens of pages, but I’ll keep it to the above five reference points, which alone put you ahead of the pack. And stay tuned, because while DYOR takes time, FlourishingAI will automate and speed up much of this soon. May you always Flourish! "
https://medium.com/flourishing-capital/the-white-houses-digital-assets-executive-order-the-short-version-bd669997bda9?source=collection_home---------9----------------------------,"I read the executive order memorandum and accompanying press call transcript, so you don’t have to. Here’s what you need to know. The one sentence summary for the Truly Busy The EO calls for the USA’s government to promote a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), improve America’s digital assets innovation competitiveness, reduce volatility in digital asset markets, lower financial services prices, and eliminate or mitigate “illicit activities” (mostly money laundering and terrorism financing). The Actual Summary According to the Biden administration, the EO is a is a response to the “explosive growth” in digital assets, increased interest by sovereign powers in central bank digital currencies, and an interest in American technological leadership. The measures focus on six key areas: consumer protection, financial stability, curbing illicit activity, U.S. technology leadership, financial inclusion, and responsible development. The EO directs various agencies to issue a final report and recommendations 180 days from now, on August 25, 2022. Consumer protection: There’s a reason this was mentioned first, namely, that this is the administration’s priority. The Biden administration has two goals here: provide improved standardized reporting (to make sure you understand your risks) and understanding where traditional finance is failing to provide services which crypto provides (ok, boomers). There’s language indicating government agency involvement in helping businesses promote crypto adoption as an effort to level the playing field between whales and new comers. Financial stability: The idea here is to analyze how the various government alphabet agencies can help reduce volatility. quoting the price pre-covid (10,300), November 2021 (70,000) and currently (38,000). Using this as a benchmark he wants government agencies to educate more people including themselves on the causes of volatility (*ahem* pump and dumps *cough*) and how increased education and adoption properly channeled would counter volatility. Illicit uses: The EO highlights the term “ illicit finance” in some capacity 24 times in the document, mostly in the context of money laundering, theft, and countering the financing of terrorism (to absolutely no one’s surprise). There’s also some indication investigation division funding at the DOJ and FBI will be increased. Primarily, the Biden administration is putting lax enforcement governments on notice to step it up. Here’s the prize quote from section 2(c): “Illicit actors, including the perpetrators of ransomware incidents and other cybercrime, often launder and cash out of their illicit proceeds using digital asset service providers in jurisdictions that have not yet effectively implemented the international standards set by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF).” There’s no real discussion present of balancing privacy and enforcement. Responsible Innovation: This section emphasizes that the United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development of digital assets, as well as some references to crypto as a job creator and innovation driver. The message here seems to be “we’d like blockchains to be made in America”. The choice quote references digital asset development which promotes “ democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems”. There’s a specific nod to cryptocurrencies’ consensus mechanisms energy usage and resultant greenhouse gas emission, which means we’re likely to see increasing competition to reduce energy consumption among blockchain consensus mechanisms in the near future. Financial Inclusion: Summarizes and references “future of money” publication by the Treasury as well as the future plans to evaluate the necessity of a “digital dollar” issued by the central banks, with the stated goal of reducing the cost of financial transfers. While there’s references to reducing consumer confusion and fear around crypto currencies, the main message here is simple: money transfer agents like Western Union will see a significant disruption in their businesses. U.S. Leadership: I’ll quote the EO directly, from section 4(i): “Sovereign money is at the core of a well-functioning financial system, macroeconomic stabilization policies, and economic growth. My Administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC.” The EO goes on to say in section 4(iii) that “Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit to the President a report on the future of money and payment systems, including the conditions that drive broad adoption of digital assets.” Taken together, the meaning is clear — the Biden administration wants the creation of, and a prominent role for, a US central bank digital currency (CBDC, they call it). Along with consumer protection, the push for a CBDC seems to the the primary thrust of this document, indicating it’s a matter of when, not if the Federal Reserve Bank will issue one. Are they going to burn the minting keys? I’ll let you decide. But the answer is no. This is by no means exhaustive, and I’ve trimmed a number of other interesting additions for the sake of clarity and brevity, but there you have it.

Two quick points of clarification: Click here to learn about all the different benefits I can provide my readers on Substack — If you enjoyed MOAM on Medium, you will love MOAM on Substack as the platform gives me much more control over what I can provide my readers. I love Medium, and I'll always maintain a presence here as I would not have any writing career to speak of without it. But running a publication here no longer makes sense for me. I have been reading, editing, and publishing over a dozen stories submitted to MOAM every day for 5+ years and have never been paid a single penny for any of that work. My personal and professional life — and the duties that come with them — have expanded exponentially over the past five years. I'm at a stage in my life where I refuse to work for free. The rational thing would have been to make this move 18 months ago… but I delayed the decision for as long as I could because, as I said, I love this platform and wanted very badly to turn MOAM into a major publication here. There was a period from 2019 to late 2021 where I thought that would happen, but it didn't work out. Thank you to all the writers who have submitted stories to Making of a Millionaire over the past five years. There are so many writers who contributed to this publication over the years, but I want to highlight people like Rocco Pendola Charlie Brown Opher Ganel who have contributed to this publication for it’s duration and other writers who have been major contributors recently like Eve Arnold, Denis Gorbunov Aldric Chen to name a very few. I’m proud of the work that we published here. And thanks to the readers who have supported this publication — I will never stop being amazed that there is a group of people who enjoy my very nerdy, research-driven take on personal finance. But I don't want this to sound like a eulogy; it's not! MOAM is very much alive; it's just moved over to Substack. I am still going to publish articles on Medium, just under a different banner. So, if you enjoy my writing here, you don’t have to do anything; I’ll publish articles on Medium. If you want to directly support my writing and gain access to all my work — including books, courses, and the MOAM Savings club — you can do so right here. "

The whole creator economy is like this. Hundreds of people are selling courses about Twitter, Medium, YouTube, TikTok, etc. The original clients learn “the secrets” and find other ambitious people. Personally, I have nothing against these creators. How could I? I sell online courses too. People are providing a service that others want to pay for. All power to them. What pains me the most is seeing ambitious folks spend $100s on coaching or sprints — and then give up. They feel like they’re making progress towards their goals, only to “take a break” a few weeks later when they burn out. Sharing random brain farts might feel like you’re building an audience — and maybe you are. But let me ask you this: Why do you want an audience in the first place?

The GPT transforms AI customization into a seamless, code-free experience, exclusively for the ChatGPT Plus community. One year post-launch, ChatGPT redefined digital chatter. Fast forward to today, OpenAI rolls out a sleek platform that crafts tailored ChatGPTs, sans coding. But this week something major started to roll out in a beta version. In the pipeline are the GPT Store’s curated AI agents, ready to be deployed. While the store’s interface remains under wraps, OpenAI hints at rewarding creators for their GPT’s traction. These bespoke GPTs, earmarked for ChatGPT Plus patrons and OpenAI’s enterprise allies, promise tailored internal tools for teams and users alike. This means anyone with ChatGPT Plus will be able to create a bespoke chat bot that can excel in one specific task that it is trained to do. Revealed at DevDay, OpenAI’s inaugural code conclave in San Francisco, the buzz also included a more potent, budget-friendly GPT-4, cost cuts for developers embedding OpenAI’s tech, and ChatGPT’s climb to a weekly 100 million-user pinnacle. OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT sparked a wave of requests for personalization. They kicked off with Custom Instructions in July for basic preferences, yet the appetite for deeper customization grew.

For the past few years, we’ve seen some unprecedented developments take place in the stock market, and with them has come a lot of uncertainty. On one hand, tech stocks have driven most of the growth in the past 2 years thanks to the AI wave, and this trend is expected to continue. Indexes like the S&P 500 have become extremely tech-overweight, and stocks like Nvidia are trading at XXX times their earnings. This is a typical case of overvaluation and it should have shown some signs of slowing down, but it simply hasn’t. On the other hand, we have some of the most uncertain geopolitical and economic context in decades, with wars both in the Middle East and eastern europe. Elsewhere, inflation is still very present, and in countries like the US the end of the student loan forgiveness program is expected to shave off $100 billion of consumer spending in the coming years, greatly diminishing companies' profits. These factors have led some experts to believe a recession may be coming. With that in mind, I thought it would be useful to write up a little reminder on the 4 pillars of successful investing. These pillars are true in any situation: Nobody can predict the future for sure.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access.

The books say nothing of your emotional self-control when you see your wealth wiped out in a matter of days. Such is the fast-paced stock market of the 21st century.

Many tell you that you need more than $1,000,000 to think about retirement, others that you will never be able to do it because the government and economy will never let you, and finally, the FIRE movement gurus who tell you that the only way is creating a millionaire business that let you live in peace (like this is as easy as learning to cook). Part of those misconceptions are because of social media. You see this millionaire teenage boy who bought 135 Bitcoins when it was at $10 and now is living his best life, others who inherit a good amount from a grandfather who had this successful business, and others simply copy what others say because it sounds cool. The reality is that retirement is possible for almost everybody, but you must understand what it really means for ordinary people and set realistic goals according to your possibilities. Here, I will show you how to know how much money you need to retire and also debunk most of the myths that make us believe that we will never be able to do it. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, retirement means “The point at which someone stops working, because of having reached a particular age or because of ill health, or the period in someone’s life after the person has stopped working.” Normally, when a person retires, it’s because he can’t keep working properly and wants to start living a life of peace doing what they want. For example, in 2005, my parents decided they didn’t want to work anymore. They both had cancer, and when they recovered, they chose to enjoy more of their family and life instead of work, so they made a plan with their savings and realized that with passive income, they could retire with $1000 a month each. They worked a little bit hard for a while to buy a new car and pay off a house in the Caribbean, and then they moved… "

The question is, why do they do this? The simple answer is, it’s profitable to do so. To explain why, imagine you decide to buy a home worth 10 million. You’ve got 20 million in the bank, and so if you wanted you could pay for it outright. But you decide you’re going to take out a mortgage, and so you go to the bank and ask for one. The first thing the bank is going to do is deem you a safe bet, the safest of safe bets. As a result, they are going to offer you a ridiculously good interest rate. This interest rate will probably be so good that over the course of the mortgage, you will pay a rate that will be below the rate of inflation. This really matters. To understand why, let’s say that the bank offers you a 25-year mortgage. Let’s say that as part of this, they request a 10 percent deposit. That means that the loan will be worth 9 million. For simplicity’s sake, let’s ignore the initial interest rate that is offered, and let’s imagine that over the full course of the loan, the average interest rate that you pay is 1.5 percent. That may seem like a ridiculously low-interest rate, but remember, this is an average over 25 years, and in the 2010s, central bank interest rates were virtually zero. So, here you are paying out 1.5 percent a year for 25 years. At the same time, let’s imagine that inflation averages 2 percent over this period, and for simplicity’s sake, let’s imagine that the property market follows that perfectly. Historically, it has been running higher, but just for simplicity’s sake, let’s imagine it… "

Also, this discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today. If there’s a ubiquitous element in today’s frontier AI, that is embeddings. Embeddings sit at the core of models like ChatGPT, and almost all progress made over the last years in AI can be traced down one way or another to these elements.

When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly. Etsy is another marketplace and probably the best for selling your AI prompts. They get more than 454 million visitors every month, and these are all potential buyers for your products. Now, If you’ve ever tried selling on Etsy and made no sales, it’s probably one of two things But that won’t be the case for our AI prompts. Because Plus, it’s so obvious that the demand is there. So you can sell AI prompts on Etsy to make passive income. In fact, some people were smart enough to get in on this very early and are already making thousands of dollars. For a clear picture of how much you can make with this side hustle, I found 2 Etsy shops selling their AI prompts. First, we have purrfect city, And at an average price of $3.43 per prompt, this shop has made well over $9,312 passively. I also found a shop called Guide pro And at an average price of $4.99 per prompt pack, this shop has made $9,585 in passive income. My point is, AI isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay. You either adapt or get left behind. And Prompting is one of the best skills you can learn in this day and age. So if you’ve been looking for a way to get a piece of the AI pie, here’s your chance. Start your AI prompt shop today. Remember, Midjourney is just one of the AI tools you could be creating prompts for. The Prompting Class I showed you guys is for Midjourney & Midjourney is not free. It costs $10 per month but I believe it’s worth it. Once you learn how to create these prompts, you can launch your own prompt shop, or even take this side hustle one step further. Use your prompting skills to make money in various other ways. For example, you can So you learn the skill once and you’ll keep making money from your knowledge. So consider this side hustle and start improving your AI prompting skills on YouTube or with Ken Bluttman’s AI art Prompting Class.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

At first glance, they may not seem like much. Reading OpenAI’s announcements, it’s easy to get bogged down in the nerdy specificity of some of these new additions. But make no mistake; as technical as they may seem, OpenAI’s new announcements have the potential to change the world just as much as ChatGPT did around this time last year. Here’s the core of what OpenAI announced, and why it matters. One of OpenAI’s most exciting announcements was the availability of the GPT-4 Vision platform through their API. Previously, OpenAI had released the Vision platform only via their ChatGPT interface. Vision is super powerful, but was somewhat limited — in order to use it, you needed to log into ChatGPT and upload your images manually, a few at a time. Adding Vision to OpenAI’s API is a game changer. It means that instead of having to use a manual process, developers can now build vision capabilities directly into their own applications. A screen-reader company, for example, could build the system into their software, allowing visually impaired readers to have a description of any image on the internet instantly created and read aloud as they surf. I tested this new capability myself and it’s pretty remarkable. Media companies like my company, Gado Images, can use the Vision platform to understand the visual contents of our databases of tens of thousands, or even millions, of images. That capability makes it way easier to locate valuable parts of a collection. "

Well, people who didn’t read the article lost their minds. Or those people who have a stake in the SaaS status quo, yeah, they lost their minds. In another article a couple days ago, I asked if AI was just another big investor headfake, like NFTs. Not as many people lost their minds. Apparently people love SaaS, but are skeptical of AI. Me too. I’ve got a long history with Generative AI. I was there at the beginning, with Automated Insights, co-inventing the first Gen-AI platform that was being used in mass market applications. We exited to a private equity firm in 2015, and after that I believe they went the wrong way with the tech and I left in 2018. The thing is, I’ve been skeptical of Generative AI for over a year now, because I already know where this is headed. I know the right way to use the tech. It’s killing me. And it has to do with the end of SaaS. I said that the end of what we’re calling SaaS is closer than you think. It’s right there in the title, haters. TL;DR;Just-fired-off-an-angry-comment: Oracle and SAP aren’t going bankrupt tomorrow. But we’re quickly approaching the inflection point where the user expectations and the tech are converging on a Do-It-For-Me brand of data analysis that’s going to eclipse the current Do-It-Yourself model. Thus, developers of software and apps will no longer be able to get away with just barfing out aggregated and summarized data back to the user for them to make their own business decisions. When people talk about the uselessness of apps like Google Analytics 4 (GA4), which is actually very useful for people who know how to crunch the data, this is what they’re talking about. As I said in the article, the effect of Generative AI is going to bring about a rise in demand from the customer who wants solid decision options laid out… "

Hamill lamented that his character originally stood for hope, but had transformed from an idealistic Jedi into a cranky recluse by the time of the sequel. While some of the creative decisions in The Last Jedi displeased fans and even Hamill himself, Skywalker eventually joins the battle against the power hungry First Order and sacrifices himself for the greater good. While the character is unquestionably heroic, he has also shed some of his unbridled optimism and focuses on teaching the film’s protagonist about “balance in the force.” My interpretation of balance in the force includes the ideals of integrating our best and worst characteristics so we can be whole people, being honest with ourselves, and not dwelling in delusion. These concepts from Episode VIII echo in venture capital and entrepreneurship, where delusion can often be rationalized as a cost of doing business and lying viewed as a necessary evil when attempting to achieve audacious goals. Rather than embrace “radical candor” as a means to arriving at a practical view of reality, I’ve seen venture capitalists prop up entrepreneurs with toxic positivity, pretending that everything is awesome all the time until the moment they pull the financial plug. In turn, entrepreneurs can take the same approach with their employees, customers, investors, and board of directors. As a person who wants my praise to be credible, I’ve never been comfortable with fake compliments and I’ve often struggled to fit into an industry where cheerleading, “ruinous empathy,” and “manipulative insincerity” can be dominant modalities. Key moments in my career have reinforced this inner conflict. As background, I started in venture capital in 1992, and I’ve spent most of my career as an investor. Following business school, I became an entrepreneur and after learning to bring new products to market at an enterprise software company, I co-founded the first cash-back rewards program for online shopping, a company called SmartFrog. My co-founder and I raised a small amount of angel capital for SmartFrog, and then failed to raise a larger investment round from professional venture capital firms. We ran the company for a little over a year, and we were lucky to be able to sell the business to Cybergold, a small public startup in the rewards space. Our first hire at SmartFrog was a young, talented utility player named Casey Bradstreet. Casey was smart, tough, and full of enthusiasm — she was willing to take on anything. I enforced high standards with Casey and things weren’t easy for her, because our entire company was trying something that nobody had ever done before. A few years after we all left Cybergold, I reconnected with Casey and she said something that made a critical impression on me: Positivity can be motivational, empowering, and exciting. It can cause people to try outrageous things they wouldn’t otherwise attempt, like running a startup. It can rally teams to meet product development timelines, accept lower compensation with the hope of building long term equity value, and most importantly, “believe.” When based in reality, positivity can be an incredible force. But sometimes being positive is just… bullshit. In my experience with teammates like Casey, positivity worked best when tethered to disciplines like driving improvement and accomplishing tangible goals. In the short term, positivity can deliver incredible results; but positivity can turn to negativity over the long term if there is no substance to back up the emotional highs, rhetoric, and mythology. The venture industry is littered with examples of toxic high fliers, like Fyre Festival, Theranos, WeWork, FTX, and many more that failed the test of time. This is where honesty comes in. Everything in life has good and bad, especially startups and venture capital. Being positive without focusing on what can be corrected and improved leaves us vulnerable—just as Luke Skywalker realized the Jedi were blindsided because they were arrogant about ignoring the Sith. Honesty can be applied to hiring and firing, investment decisions, strategy, and even when to exit a portfolio company. I’ve come to believe that honesty in venture capital and entrepreneurship requires adopting three principles: The last one is especially difficult, because true empathy is necessary to support startup founders. The entrepreneur’s job is tougher than the VC’s. Entrepreneurs deserve empathy. But even in the worst possible circumstances — such as terminating an employee — experts indicate that honesty is preferable. According to Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix: At its worst, toxic positivity can be unkind and manipulative, holding back progress. Barbara Ehrenreich describes this outcome in her 2009 book Bright-Sided, which focuses on economic injustice. Ehrenreich noted: Like Mark Hamill’s character in The Last Jedi, it’s key to see things as they really are, not just as we wish they were. If we want to improve over the long term, honesty is a necessity. Even when it’s uncomfortable.

Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor Ilya Strebulaev compiled primary data on over 160 CVC programs. Professor Strebulaev’s research on corporate venture capital investment committee composition showed that most CVC programs have between three to seven representatives, with a median of four representatives on the investment committee: Only 4% of 160 CVCs included an external representative, an outsider not affiliated with the corporation, serving as a member of the corporate venture capital investment committee. Professor Strebulaev begins to make the case for why an external member should be on the IC: Research from INSEAD further supports the idea of including external team members in a corporate VC: Based on my experience managing multiple corporate VC programs, every CVC should have at least one external IC member. I believe there are four primary benefits: Professor Strebulaev’s research indicates CVC investment committees often include senior corporate executives such as the CEO, CFO, or a business unit leader. These executives tend to have significant experience operating large enterprises and also possess industry expertise. However, these executives typically have less experience or familiarity with venture-backed startups. An experienced VC or CVC investor can complement corporate expertise by providing judgment as to whether the investment team completed adequate diligence, helping identify risks by applying pattern recognition from previous VC deals, reviewing venture deal terms to ensure compliance with industry norms, and evaluating whether the proposed investment could generate a sufficient venture capital return for the stage of investment. An external representative can likely help with the assessment of the startup’s management team and the quality of the other co-investors, since an experienced external IC member should have a large network of venture capital relationships to facilitate checking references. An external representative can also be valuable when making follow-on investment decisions, since the corporation may be evaluating and negotiating terms that are specific to venture capital, such as bridge rounds and pay-to-play provisions. Corporate investment committees may spend a lot of their time thinking about how a startup company addresses strategic needs for the corporation, including whether the corporate parent can become a customer or leverage the product or service of the proposed startup investment. While that mindset is important when evaluating a CVC investment, the corporation should also think about the opportunities the start-up has outside of the corporation’s four walls. When corporations make venture capital investments, they should want to ensure the market opportunity is larger than just the potential business that can be conduct with the corporation. If the corporation is the only customer, a minority investment is unlikely to produce venture returns. An experienced and effective external IC member should help the corporate IC evaluate the startup’s prospects with other potential customers outside the corporate parent, and even beyond the corporation’s industry. The external IC member should ensure the investment team performed adequate customer references with other potential customers and partners. Professor Strebulaev’s research noted that 29% of CVCs reported that a single vote is the pivotal decision maker. It’s logical to conclude that the most senior internal executive on the IC, such as the CEO or CFO, is that pivotal decision maker. An outsider may be the right person to point out risks or potential benefits to those senior executives, to offset a potential single point of failure. Would an IC consisting of executives who report to the CEO go against a strong-willed CEO? I have seen first hand how subordinates to a senior executive can be afraid to do so. Being willing to speak up when the facts are not being considered objectively is an important role that can be performed more easily by an independent IC representative. Professor Strebulaev notes: Nearly every large corporation has one or more independent members on its board of directors to provide objective governance and oversight, so why shouldn’t the corporate venture investment committee do the same? An effective external IC representative should also educate less experienced corporate executives on everything from how to conduct diligence, analyzing financial models including evaluating market size, understanding investment returns analyses, becoming fluent with venture capital terms, and more. A typical corporate IC member is likely unfamiliar with VC terminology like liquidation preference calculations, anti-dilution protection equations, various redemption rights, ROFR and co-sale rights, and protective provision thresholds, and many others. A diligent external IC member will take the time to not only explain the term clearly to the rest of the investment committee, but will explain why a particular term might be more or less important for a specific proposed investment. CVC leadership should select an external IC representative who has not just experience, but also demonstrates a love of teaching, since those roles can contribute to the capability and performance of the entire investment committee. Whoever serves on the corporate venture IC should act as a fiduciary in the best interests of the corporation. There are several requirements of being a fiduciary, including like disclosing and managing conflicts, as well as putting the corporate parent’s interests ahead of the IC representative’s own self interest. Registered Investment Advisers (“RIAs”) are, by law, fiduciaries to the clients they serve. As such they not only undergo training to be competent fiduciaries, they also practice it day in and day out while interacting with their clients. Moreover, under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Section 202(a)(11), any person or firm that, (1) for compensation, (2) is engaged in the business, and (3) provides advice about securities, will need to register as an investment adviser (an RIA) with either the state where they operate or with the Securities and Exchange Commission, unless there is an appropriate exemption. Therefore, by including a compensated, external representative on a corporate IC who is a practicing VC investor, that individual should be, or be associated with, an RIA. The Touchdown Ventures team has significant venture capital and corporate venture capital experience, having managed over 100 corporate venture capital investments as an external partner to more than 20 corporations. We also teach venture capital and corporate innovation at leading universities including the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and the UCLA Anderson School of Business. Our team has previously taught or guest lectured at the Wharton School of Business, Harvard University, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, University of California Santa Barbara, California Polytechnic University, Carnegie Mellon, University of California Davis, the University of Southern California, University of Texas Austin, Stockholm’s Royal Institute of Technology, and many others. Touchdown Ventures is also a Registered Investment Adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our team has served on over 20 corporate venture capital ICs, and we are available to serve on the VC investment committees of corporations seeking to maximize financial and strategic returns. As my co-founder Scott Lenet writes in his article on driving high performance investment committees, there are numerous best practices for serving in this role that can smooth the process for everyone involved.

https://medium.com/touchdownvc/33-of-fortune-500-corporations-actively-invest-in-startups-c9c0dde2c963?source=author_recirc-----4b26cd48d15e----2---------------------0ddf6f35_2564_47e4_b58f_4385aa7c8c7e-------,"Corporations are increasingly working with external innovators — startups — to achieve strategic objectives like growing revenue, improving profitability, building a pipeline of new offerings, defending existing lines of business, and more. When these startups succeed, the resulting collaborations with established corporations have the potential to deliver transformative results. Unfortunately, startups fail at a relatively high rate. According to research from Elizabeth Pollman, Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Institute for Law and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, 75% of venture capital-backed startups do not succeed. This is one of the reasons why corporations should take a portfolio approach when it comes to working with startups, whether the transactional approach is M&A, commercial engagements, or corporate venture capital (“CVC”) investing. For CVCs, building a portfolio requires maintaining an active presence in the market to generate and review deal flow, regularly investing in startups, and reaching diversification through a minimum of ten unique investment positions over the course of a single “fund,” often over a period of three to six years. A portfolio of this size can potentially insulate corporate investors from the high failure rate of startups and maximize the chances of achieving strategic and financial objectives. To determine whether the largest corporations in the U.S. are taking a portfolio approach to investing in startups, I reviewed the corporations on the 2023 Fortune 500 list and evaluated whether each company maintains an active corporate venture capital program. This analysis relies on investment activity data provided solely by Pitchbook, and also includes each corporation’s location and industry sector, along with revenue figures provided by Fortune. It’s possible that a corporation may have made venture capital investments but not reported them to Pitchbook, and those transactions would not be captured in this analysis. The 2023 Fortune 500 list, now in its 69th year, ranks the largest U.S. corporations by 2022 revenue. The top ten companies posted $3.7 trillion in revenue, representing some of the biggest names in the U.S. economy. Among the 2023 list, 95% are publicly traded; the rest are privately held. The median 2022 fiscal year revenue for Fortune 500 companies was $16.3 billion, with a range of $2.6 billion to $573 billion from top-ranked Walmart. The median market cap for the publicly traded companies on the list is $34 billion. According to Pitchbook data, 75% of companies on the 2023 Fortune 500 list have made at least one VC Investment in their history. While many corporates have previously invested in startups, this does not mean they maintain an active CVC program today. For this analysis, we defined an active CVC program as having made at least two investments over the past two years. This minimum level of activity, even in a turbulent economy, signals to the market that the corporation is “open for business” and actively investing in startups. Based on the data I reviewed from Pitchbook, 33% of companies on the 2023 Fortune 500 list met this standard for an active investment program over the past 2 years. This data suggests that the majority of corporations that have made at least one VC investment have dormant, abandoned, or ad hoc programs. This indicates a disparity between active investors and CVC dabblers. I took a closer look at the 166 corporations we determined were operating active, professionalized CVC programs. The median number of investments over the past two years for corporations maintaining active CVCs was five (5), with an average of fifteen (15) investments, and a standard deviation of 26. The data is skewed by a small set of high volume investment programs. There is a notable gap between new CVCs making a few investments per year and much larger incumbents investing at a greater volume. The number of investments over the past two years ranged from two (2)— the minimum threshold — to a maximum of 200+ investments made by Alphabet across its multiple investment funds. Other notable, high volume programs include Salesforce and Intel, each making over 100 investments during the past two years. The majority of Fortune 500 corporations with active CVCs is split evenly between companies based in the northeast, midwest, and west. While 25% of active CVCs are based in the western U.S., with the majority in California, only 16% of the 2023 Fortune 500 list is composed of corporates in the west. This implies corporations based in the western U.S. disproportionately use CVC as an innovation tool compared to corporates in other parts of the country. Given the influence of Silicon Valley on the venture capital industry, this isn’t surprising. It’s also not surprising that corporations in software, information technology, financial services, and media make up 41% of active Fortune 500 CVCs. Companies in this sector compose only 28% of the Fortune 500 list, however, demonstrating that this sector is over-represented among active CVCs. The pedigree of technology companies, which in many cases includes venture-capital backing, may help explain why they are more active CVCs compared to corporations in other sectors. With a third of the nation’s largest corporations actively making venture capital investments, CVC is increasingly mainstream. Corporates accounted for 63% of U.S. venture capital deal value through Q3 2023, the highest percentage ever, according to the NVCA and Pitchbook. For the 25% of Fortune 500 corporations that have never reported a venture capital investment to organizations like Pitchbook that track these deals, it’s likely time to consider one of these programs as an avenue for generating strategic and financial impact. For the 42% of the Fortune 500 that have made an investment in the past but do not currently maintain an active program according to reported data, it may be prudent to evaluate a more professionalized portfolio approach.

As a result, my partners and I are frequently asked, There are a handful of tactical and values-oriented answers, such as hard work, financial discipline, consistent follow through, communication, building an extensive network of trusted relationships, attention to the craft of supporting your portfolio of startups, and so on. These are important, but they pale next to what I consider to be the single most important indicator of whether the program will stand the test of time: securing ongoing support from the corporation’s CEO. In fact, we believe CEO support is so important that we’ve developed a rule that we won’t get involved if the person running the firm isn’t personally informed and considered to be a key stakeholder of the CVC fund. So how should corporate venture capitalists go about securing that support? It’s pretty simple: pursue investments that support the CEO’s stated objectives. In many ways, the job of the CVC is to ensure that the CEO doesn’t get fired for failing to implement strategic objectives that pay off in the mid-term and the long-term. One of my favorite tests for corporate innovators and CVCs is to imagine yourself running into your CEO in the halls of the corporate headquarters. You’ve just closed and announced a deal with a startup. The transaction could be an acquisition, a commercial deal, or an investment, all of which can be generated by the deal flow of a corporate venture program. The CEO stops you and says, “I saw the press for that deal you just closed. Tell me why we did this transaction?” In my mind, the best possible answer is, “In one of our recent meetings, you said you wanted the corporation to do [x]. We believe that working with this startup puts us in a position to do what you asked.” [x] could be anything that the CEO and board believe is a strategic priority for the organization. That might be entering a new market, improving margins in an existing line of business, defending the core from a disruptive threat, and even using innovation opportunities to energize the employee base about the corporation’s relevance. At that point, the CEO may be satisfied or want to follow up to get more details or ask questions. But there are few scenarios in which that person is likely to ask “Wait. Why are you trying to do what I said was important?” This dynamic reflects the roles of everyone involved. The CEO, board, and the rest of the c-suite are responsible for setting strategy. It’s their job to understand what matters and where the company needs to go. The innovation and ventures team is responsible for sourcing, evaluating, executing, and managing transactions that support these goals. When the tactics (transactions including investments, business development deals, and M&A) support the strategy (board approved objectives), everyone is doing the right job. Dave Petratis is the former chairman and CEO of the security company Allegion, a publicly traded S&P component that was spun off from Ingersoll Rand and one of Touchdown’s corporate partners. Petratis championed the launch of Allegion’s venture capital program, empowering his team with direct input about the board’s priorities: Consider one of the most common alternative approaches in corporate venturing: the innovation team doesn’t want to build a strong connection to the parent company. In fact, not only don’t these teams want to use the strategic investing program to service the organization that’s provided financial sponsorship of the CVC, but they want to get as far away as possible from the bureaucracy and needs of the parent company. These individuals may even want to use the CVC as a stepping stone to what they consider to be a “real” career in venture capital at an institutionally-backed investment firm. While there are examples of successful firms that have evolved from a captive corporate venture capital model to a traditional institutional model, my partners and I have seen few cases where those funds provide meaningful ongoing value to their former parent companies. In many ways, the desire to escape is understandable, because big companies are beset with a host of frustrating behaviors and red tape. Unfortunately, enduring the hassles of the “corporate beast” is one of the taxes of running a CVC program. This requires patience, dedication, and an ongoing direct line of communication so that the CEO can tell you what’s most important at any point in time. The more your CEO trusts the venture team with what matters, the more effective that CVC team can be. In addition, CEO support can also galvanize internal resources to help CVC portfolio companies succeed. Early in our experience providing managed venture capital services for corporations, we worked with an organization that embodied this challenge. The key principals in the day-to-day role inside the corporation didn’t want to link the tactical transactions to the broader needs of their company. They just wanted to do deals they personally found interesting. Unfortunately, that’s not the job. Doing deals just because you like them is what angel investors do, not CVCs. Those employees were smart and motivated and had good intentions, but they weren’t setting themselves up for success in corporate venture capital. At the time, we didn’t have enough experience or gravitas to share our views forcefully enough to make a difference. Unsurprisingly, that program was shut down in relatively short order. In my experience, the best path to longevity requires ensuring that the CEO understands that he or she is the most important customer of the CVC and feels free to share changing priorities of the corporation. Petratis notes: Hardening this link doesn’t mean your CEO needs to serve on the venture fund’s investment committee or become a bottleneck for decisions; the CEO simply needs to be able to keep the CVC team informed on the direction of the corporation so they can focus on what matters and support the direction of the business.

Surely it is a topic for the fund managers but broader audience may also be interested in this as grasping the nuances of how venture capitalists construct their fund’s financial frameworks shed some light behind strategies and what drives decisions. Topic of ‘How to build a financial model for a startup’ garners widespread attention. An abundance of courses and tools are available to guide founders in developing budgets or financial models, with support from various agents and consultants. However, when the lens is shifted to focus on modelling a VC Fund’s cash flows / returns, the landscape changes drastically. This area is less explored with limited publicly available knowledge. While the foundational aspects of VC funds’ economics and compensation structures, like the ‘2 and 20’ model, are well understood, the difficulty of return modelling remain largely under wraps. Hope this read will gear you with the necessary knowledge and tools to dive into the subject. Much like the sales projections for early-stage startups, accurately forecasting the exact returns of a VC fund is a complex endeavour, laden with numerous ‘ifs’ and ‘unknowns’ that are impossible to fully anticipate. However despite complexity process of returns modelling is important. It enables us to construct and comprehend the links between our own assumptions and the probable outcomes. Such understanding is crucial for identifying and monitoring the most critical elements of investment strategy, proactively measuring its sensitivity and, if necessary, adapting it within set limits. First things first: template we will be discussing below is accessible through this link. Construct of it as follows: CapTable Dynamics Model includes and based on Pro-Forma Captable of a startup — Funds potential (or current) target company. It is built on the set of assumptions (e.g. valuations and sizes of the financing rounds raised by investee company, cadency, etc.) which are dependent on the industrial, geographical and other particularities as well as general state of investment and M&A markets. To illustrate: recently French generative AI lab Mistral AI (formed by Meta and Deepmind alumnis) raised €105m seed round, hence assuming €1,5m Seed Round (as on the screen above) for AI startup won’t be correct, while it can perfectly fit the norm for different industry or GEO. Tip: best to prove and sanity check these assumptions with up-to-date market statistics on the deals within Fund’s target segment(s) and parameters of previous deal closed. Take as much data as you can, and for that you can use services alike of PitchBook. Investment Strategy and other assumptions In addition to target companies’ CapTable dynamics, model takes into account: (i) Set of General Assumptions Key parameters of the Fund (size, fees structure, etc.) to be used for its top-line economics calculation. *Management fee flow calculated within this model can be used a ‘revenue’ for the purposes of Fund’s budget development (ii) Details of investment strategy Parameters of initial investments (size, number of deals, cadency) and follow-on deals; linked and to be aligned with ‘Pro Forma Captable’. (iii) Portfolio Dynamics Assumptions related to target share of companies in portfolio which will be exited or written-off over the life time of the fund. (iv) Exits Assumptions related to target returns from exits (per portfolio company and stage): profitable, neutral or negative; to be aligned with ‘Pro Forma Captable’ dynamics. Model is built as a funnel with all above-described assumptions used to calculate a conversion of a ‘unit’ (portfolio company) from stage to stage of a funnel (from Funding Round to Funding Round), with some companies being exited (either with profit or written off) at each stage. Follow-on investments also considerered here as portfolio companies progress to subsequent stages, along with various exit scenarios. For simplicity, we categorize exits into two types: ‘profitable’ and ‘unprofitable’. More intricate and accurate models could employ probability-weighted multi-parameters and other more sophisticated methods. The model then utilizes the results of this funnel calculation, along with other inputted parameters, to generate its outputs. The key results of this strategic analysis are consolidated and displayed on the ‘Dashboard’ spreadsheet, providing a comprehensive cash-flow overview. In my experience, such level of details provides a perfect balance between model’s simplicity (model is easy to understand and modify; its parameters can be adjusted on the fly without complex re-calculations) and precision (required level of prediction power). However, few important things were still missing. The challenge is that most early-stage VCs, including ourselves, do not manage billion-dollar funds and thus number of companies in a single fund limited by its AUM will rarely exceed 30–40 names. Hence, rounding error might be pivotal for model outcome: e.g. if we assume 30% chance of conversion for cohort of 2 companies simple multiplication and rounding will lead to wrong result. Solution we found was to replace multiplication with “yes/no” trigger. We used a built-into excel VBA (it’s literally just 1 line of code!) to randomise number from 1 to 100 and check if it’s above the assumed threshold (i.e. 20 for 20% write-off chance) to ‘activate the trigger’. Code for this as follows : This approach allows us to correctly model the funnel for small number of companies via iterative checks if each of them will be converted, written-off or exited at each stage. This approach allows us to correctly model the funnel for small number of companies via iterative checks if each of them will be converted, written-off or exited at each stage. Consequently, the financial model’s accuracy heavily relies on the outcomes of randomisation. And in this case it’s prudent to evaluate the model’s robustness, ensuring that the range of outcomes from identical inputs remains within acceptable limits. To address this, we’ve introduced a ‘Sustainability Testing’ in the ‘Dashboard’ sheet. This section aggregates and reprocesses the results of eight recalculations (tests), utilizing an additional simple VBA macro for this purpose.

Our portfolio boasts 110+ investments, with notable winners like LinkedIn, Pandora, TrueCar, and Scopely. Despite the ebb and flow of markets, venture capital remains a beacon for returns; however, the returns in VC are ruled by a key principle: the Power Law. Here’s how it shapes the fate of micro and mega funds — and how it impacts portfolio companies and fund investors (LPs). At its core, the VC power law dictates that a handful of investments typically drive the bulk of returns. A few successful investments can recoup the losses of many unsuccessful ones. This isn’t restricted by sector or geography; it’s universal. A study by AngelList covering 1,808 investments cemented the importance of the power law in VC. The takeaway? Identifying, assisting, and protecting their ownership positions in unicorns is essential for VC funds. Success in venture capital is partly about getting the ownership math right. Typically, a lead VC’s stake in early-stage start-ups ranges between 10% and 25%. And here’s where fund size plays a role: Both start-up founders and venture fund investors (LPs) should understand the effects of power law on the VCs they partner with. Recognizing the power law dynamics helps founders select ideal investors and secure favorable term sheets. Micro funds can support founders looking at exits between $50 — $250M and still make a strong return on investment. These VCs will work hard to help you even if you’re not going for an IPO or M&A exit with a multi-billion-dollar valuation. Large VCs prioritize potential billion-dollar companies: they are the only ones that have a real impact on their returns. If you’re not tracking to become a unicorn, they cannot spend their time helping you. And let’s face it: the number of $2.5B companies is exceedingly small. Quick cash feels good, but ultimately weakens the bottom line. In our experience, M&A activity typically occurs 5–7 years into a start-up’s lifecycle and IPOs happen in the 10–12-year range. Data supports this observation. According to PitchBook data, the older the vintage year of a high-performing emerging fund — which means more time for portfolio companies to grow — the more capital gets distributed to investors. Remember: larger funds can swing more often but need to back their top performers heavily. Micro funds should prioritize securing sizable early stakes and defending them through subsequent funding rounds. When selecting a fund to invest in, research the fund’s post-investment practices and make sure they do just that. The VC power law isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s the bedrock of venture capital returns. Both fund size and the power law dynamic are instrumental in shaping the investment landscape. Whether you’re an investor, founder, or an LP, navigating these waters requires a strong grasp of the power law dynamics and their impact on micro and larger funds.

VCs do care about Life time value (LTV) / Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)? OR CAC < LTV. Actually — they don’t care about this ratio. What! Why? 😬 Let’s understand this — A business is an engine that attracts customers, delivers something of value to them, and then extracts that value in the form of profits. That’s what a business is. Thus it logically follows that the cost of attracting a new customer needs to be less than the value we can extract from that customer. If it costs us $15 in advertising to get a customer, and we can only make $7 from them then, we have a problem. But if it costs $15 to get them, and then once they are a customer they make a bunch of repeat purchases that yield $75 in profit, then we are happy. Ultimately every venture of every kind has to have a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) that is less than the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer. It’s a simple, self-evident concept. Yet it’s a leading cause of startup death. A high percentage of startups die because their cost of getting customers turns out to be higher than they can make from them. Partly this is just because we’re all optimists — we all think our startup is so awesome that people will flock to become customers and they will remain customers forever. But eventually, that optimism fades as we realize that marketing is expensive and no customer stays forever. The immutable laws of economics set in, and at some point, many startup founders find that their LTV/CAC ratio is slowly draining their bank account. Investors tend to obsess over the LTV/CAC ratio. Obviously, investors care about your LTV/CAC ratio because it’s the essence of a successful business. But it’s also a proxy for the potential ROI of their investment. If you have proof that you can spend $1 on customer acquisition activities and get $5 in value back (an LTV/CAC ratio of 5.0), investors will want to shovel as much money as possible into that engine. Most of the VCs look for ‘just-add-money opportunity.’ Having a business with an LTV/CAC ratio of over 5.0 looks like a “just-add-money opportunity” to investors. But it’s a blunt tool that is better if sharpened. Let’s say that during the quarter we spent $10,000 on sales and marketing and got 1,000 new customers — a CAC of $10. But probably some of those customers came through word-of-mouth, some came as referrals, some came from our PR efforts, and some came from paid advertising. So we had a blended CAC of $10, but that doesn’t tell us anything about the relative effectiveness of each of our different customer acquisition efforts. Which leads me to the next point: Not all customers are created equal. With every business I’ve ever run, I’ve realized at some point that 80% of our profits were coming from 20% of our customers. It’s amazing how this tends to be true with almost all businesses. So if we look at the LTV (Lifetime Value) of our entire universe of customers, we’ll probably see that 20% of them have a much higher individual LTV than the rest. Wouldn’t we want to focus our CAC efforts on getting more of the high-LTV customers? Yes, we would. The two points above would indicate we really want to track the LTV/CAC ratio by customer cohort. For example, what’s the ratio of customers acquired through Facebook advertising vs those acquired through Google advertising? Knowing that would tell us a lot about how we should allocate advertising dollars. What’s the LTV/CAC ratio for customers acquired through our referral program? Knowing that would tell us how much we can afford to offer in a referral fee. Knowing your company’s blended LTV/CAC tells you the health of the overall engine, but it doesn’t tell you how to optimize the engine’s performance for the next quarter. Tracking customer cohorts tells you that. Also, velocity matters. They Generally used CACD than CAC — the D is for “doubled”. CACD answers the question, “If we spend $12 in customer acquisition activities, how long does it take for us to get $24 back?” As an investor, he wants to see a business with a CACD of less than eight months. This formula gets to the heart of an inherent flaw in the LTV/CAC ratio: it doesn’t include a time factor. A business with an LTV/CAC ratio over 5.0 might seem good at first, but if you have to service a customer for 10 years before you make back the money you spent getting him, then it doesn’t seem so good, right? Velocity matters. So think about how you can measure CACD for your business. Putting $12 somewhere where it returns with a high velocity will accelerate your engine of growth. That’s it! So, from now it’s not LTV or CAC it’s LTV & CACD. I hope this helps, Have any question — comment down! Want to connect with 1000+ Founders & Investors? Check out our community — The Venture Crew "
https://medium.com/@rodrigo/ask-a-vc-how-long-will-it-take-to-close-my-financing-round-83d0df9a2e5c?source=read_next_recirc-----4b26cd48d15e----1---------------------8d38d7cb_389d_439d_8863_59ae87205095-------,"It is always surprising to me that I get contacted by entrepreneurs who tell me that they expect a final closing of the deal in 3 weeks' time. Although this timeframe is compatible with some investors (like business angels who invest their own money), it is certainly not possible for most professional VCs. Why is that? Before I go into details, you should assume that it will take on average about 4 months for you to close your round (ie. have the money in the bank). And if you have to prepare documentation (a new financial plan, a new business plan, a data room, etc.), maybe work with a fundraiser, you should budget for that extra time as well (1 month at least). This means you should start planning for a new fundraising 5 months in advance. And what if something goes wrong? You’ll have no leeway. So a good rule of thumb is to plan to fundraise 6 months before you run out of cash. Now, you need to show that you have reduced the risk of your business with the previous round’s money. Said differently, when you raised money last time, you raised it in order to reach a number of new KPIs (new product, MVP, POC, new client, new contract, new IP, new country…). By executing your plan correctly, you proved that you actually are trustworthy, that your venture is solid, and therefore that you have reduced the risk on the business. I would recommend having at least 12 months to do so. You can’t really do much in 6 months (which would mean you don’t have much of a moat with your business), and you shouldn’t really plan for years of development with the money raised (because that means you raised too much money and gave away too much equity; unless of course if you turned profitable). So the proper metric could be to have 12–18 months to execute your plan; adding 6 months to it for fundraising means you should always raise for an 18–24 months runway. Keep in mind that fundraising distracts the CEO (and probably also the CFO and other team members) from executing the business plan, so it’s also not a good idea to always be fundraising. Peter Walker at Carta Insights has very recent data, and suggests longer effective timeframes: There are exceptions always, and you often read about someone potentially closing a new round of financing, only months after their previous massive round. This does not reflect the needs of the business, as it would show that the investors of the previous round deeply miscalculated the financing need of the company, and would have invested knowing that the company would go bankrupt very shortly. It just reflects supply and demand in this market, with new investors wanting to jump on board and invest money. If money is being thrown at you, why not take it? It’s debatable, and not the point of this article. Now why do you need on average 4 months? Who are you going to raise money from? Unless you know all investors, their investment stage in the fund (what year in the investment period), their investment strategies, their potential conflicts of interest, and their appetite for your sector, it is going to take some time to find the right sponsor at a venture capital firm. You could do this by pitching at some event on stage, or by cold emailing investors. You could also benefit from a warm intro from someone who knows investors well, like a friend, a business contact, or a professional fundraiser. What you want here is to spark the interest of a specific person, with decision power at a firm, which usually is a general partner; or a principal. I would estimate this phase to be 2–4 weeks. 2. Confirm the interest of the investor. VCs see a lot of deals every week. In my case, for the past few years, it was always about 50/week. We would meet with about 10%, so about 5 entrepreneurs per week are invited to a meeting or another call. Let’s assume here, you are going into another call. What the VC is interested in at that moment is to assess whether your company is investable; to fill in the gaps from your deck, or your presentation. He’ll ask questions about many things: market size, product demo, competition, business model, cash-flow projections, team background, go-to-market strategies, valuation, investment instrument, terms, etc. Keep in mind he is doing this with 5 other companies every week, and has still a few left in the analysis phase from previous weeks. As a rule of thumb, a partner at a firm will probably invest once every quarter (so 3–4 deals/year; with 3 partners at a firm, that’s about 10 deals/year; the investment period is in the first 3–4 years for a fund). As soon as the partner finds something that is a red flag, he will try to understand how to circumvent it, or just stop the process. Because of the different metrics, he will NOT invest in all investable opportunities. Of course, again, I know of one prolific investor who only takes 20 min calls, and decides on the spot. Or of another early-stage VC who gives an answer within 24 hours of the 2nd call. Exceptions… Expect anything between 2–4 weeks for this phase of interaction with the entrepreneur. 3. Confirm the interest of the fund Once the partner is convinced he wants to invest, unless he has discretionary power, he needs to get approval from his investment committee (IC). To do this, usually a partner writes an investment memo for his fellow GPs (hence all the questions in step 2), that can be updated after the due diligence phase, before sometimes sharing it with the LPs. Writing this memo also takes time. Depending on the firm, the IC could be all the partners at the firm; or some representation of the investors in the firm, the LPs; or a group of external advisors who sit on this IC. Depending on the firm, there are ICs every week, every other week, once a month, or ad hoc. Remember, you are not the only company that the fund is considering, so there is a waiting list, as usually only 1–2 companies are considered at each IC. Why? because usually it requires the CEO to present for 30–60 min, and the IC to ask questions for 30–60 min. If you do it twice, it’s already a good 2 hours meeting. So you might not be scheduled for the next IC, and might have to wait for the next one, or even the one after that. So expect 1–4 weeks wait time here. Usually, the IC should say yes, but you can be sent back to the drawing board, to answer some unexpected question, or asked to come back once you confirm a KPI (eg. a contract). 4. Negotiate the Term Sheet Once you get IC approval, the Partner will send you a term sheet: it’s just a paper that confirms their offer with money they will give you, valuation, and standard terms (or not) such as drag-along, tag-along, liquidation preferences, ratchet clauses, board representation, veto rights, information rights, follow-on rights, reserved matters, etc. It could come in the same day, or take a week. But now you might want to negotiate some of the terms. Most VCs will include some terms that inexperienced entrepreneurs won’t understand fully, and might need explanation and/or negotiation. It’s a good idea here to hire a lawyer to assist you before signing (=accepting) this term sheet as it is. Some funds have a very standard entrepreneur-friendly (this means relatively simple terms), and will not modify theirs ever. It is true if they invest very fast, and very often. They know that in any case, investors at later stages will bring in new clauses, new rights, their own shareholder agreements, etc. and it’s not worth their time and money to over-complicate this stage. If you are using a convertible note template (like a SAFE) there’s nothing much to negotiate here either. I would expect 1–2 weeks here, mainly because the lawyers on each side don’t reply as fast as you would want them to. 5. Due diligence Depending on the size of the round, most funds will at this stage launch a series of audits, usually with third-party firms to check that everything you said is true and that there are no skeletons in the closet. What the fund is trying to do here is to check whether the risks are under control. So they hire: They themselves will continue checking other things: You usually don’t do this before extending a term sheet, and it’s usually left to the Lead investor to coordinate all these calls. Unfortunately, although this approach is methodical, it is not fool-proof, and every now and then, a rotten apple gets into the basket. Third-party are not on call, and may need 1–2 weeks to get started, and usually up to 2 weeks before giving a written report of their audit. Clients and references also are not readily available, so it might take time to complete them all. So expect 2–4 weeks more at this stage. 6. Investment contract and shareholder agreement (SHA) This step can be run in parallel with the previous one, although some cautious VCs will only do it once they have checked all previous boxes. An investment will reproduce all the terms in the Term Sheet but with more detail. There should be no surprises here. But every now and then, the entrepreneur’s lawyer needs to justify his fees, so starts arguing about something. The shareholder’s agreement in particular introduced new clauses that are not part of the deal, for example, what happens if the founder leaves (Key Man clause), dies (Succession rules), or needs a bit of cash (Respiration clause), etc. For very early-stage deals, the company needs to be incorporated at this stage, with bylaws, etc. So expect another 1–2 weeks. 7. Getting the money Once the investment contract and all documents are validated, we do a closing, which is a date & place where all documents are signed, between the investor (or all investors) and the entrepreneur. VCs usually don’t have money in their accounts, so as to optimize the IRR. So now they do a capital call to their own investors (the LPs), and give them 10 days to send the money to the VCs account. There might be dozens of LPs in any given fund, so it’s a laborious process to track them all, call them back, etc. Once all the money is received, the VC will wire the money to the company in a matter of hours/days. So 2 weeks here for this process. Summary As discussed above: The range above goes from almost 3 months to almost 6 months. It gets even more difficult if you have a large round with many investors (as in you need to identify them; then the Lead Investor takes over the rest). In my case, I once met an entrepreneur on a Monday, ran through the whole process at my firm in 7 days, and sent a confirmation of our commitment to investing the following week (the equivalent of step 4 here). But there was no step 1 (I found the company), no step 2 (I got convinced by his presentation), no steps 4 and 6 (as it was a syndicate, it was more of a take it or leave it condition. Nevertheless, I asked for a side letter giving me information rights with access to board packs and minutes, and access to a meeting with management quarterly); I performed nevertheless my DD just after that (and I got a lot of material from 4 other syndicating investors in the round). But I only did such as short process once. So it’s an exception. And it was the largest investment in the fund… So part of the business planning you should always consider when preparing your P&L is the equity story, and when you should start fundraising. — I consult with corporates and startups, and help them address issues like this and many more.

As a result, my partners and I are frequently asked, There are a handful of tactical and values-oriented answers, such as hard work, financial discipline, consistent follow through, communication, building an extensive network of trusted relationships, attention to the craft of supporting your portfolio of startups, and so on. These are important, but they pale next to what I consider to be the single most important indicator of whether the program will stand the test of time: securing ongoing support from the corporation’s CEO. In fact, we believe CEO support is so important that we’ve developed a rule that we won’t get involved if the person running the firm isn’t personally informed and considered to be a key stakeholder of the CVC fund. So how should corporate venture capitalists go about securing that support? It’s pretty simple: pursue investments that support the CEO’s stated objectives. In many ways, the job of the CVC is to ensure that the CEO doesn’t get fired for failing to implement strategic objectives that pay off in the mid-term and the long-term. One of my favorite tests for corporate innovators and CVCs is to imagine yourself running into your CEO in the halls of the corporate headquarters. You’ve just closed and announced a deal with a startup. The transaction could be an acquisition, a commercial deal, or an investment, all of which can be generated by the deal flow of a corporate venture program. The CEO stops you and says, “I saw the press for that deal you just closed. Tell me why we did this transaction?” In my mind, the best possible answer is, “In one of our recent meetings, you said you wanted the corporation to do [x]. We believe that working with this startup puts us in a position to do what you asked.” [x] could be anything that the CEO and board believe is a strategic priority for the organization. That might be entering a new market, improving margins in an existing line of business, defending the core from a disruptive threat, and even using innovation opportunities to energize the employee base about the corporation’s relevance. At that point, the CEO may be satisfied or want to follow up to get more details or ask questions. But there are few scenarios in which that person is likely to ask “Wait. Why are you trying to do what I said was important?” This dynamic reflects the roles of everyone involved. The CEO, board, and the rest of the c-suite are responsible for setting strategy. It’s their job to understand what matters and where the company needs to go. The innovation and ventures team is responsible for sourcing, evaluating, executing, and managing transactions that support these goals. When the tactics (transactions including investments, business development deals, and M&A) support the strategy (board approved objectives), everyone is doing the right job. Dave Petratis is the former chairman and CEO of the security company Allegion, a publicly traded S&P component that was spun off from Ingersoll Rand and one of Touchdown’s corporate partners. Petratis championed the launch of Allegion’s venture capital program, empowering his team with direct input about the board’s priorities: Consider one of the most common alternative approaches in corporate venturing: the innovation team doesn’t want to build a strong connection to the parent company. In fact, not only don’t these teams want to use the strategic investing program to service the organization that’s provided financial sponsorship of the CVC, but they want to get as far away as possible from the bureaucracy and needs of the parent company. These individuals may even want to use the CVC as a stepping stone to what they consider to be a “real” career in venture capital at an institutionally-backed investment firm. While there are examples of successful firms that have evolved from a captive corporate venture capital model to a traditional institutional model, my partners and I have seen few cases where those funds provide meaningful ongoing value to their former parent companies. In many ways, the desire to escape is understandable, because big companies are beset with a host of frustrating behaviors and red tape. Unfortunately, enduring the hassles of the “corporate beast” is one of the taxes of running a CVC program. This requires patience, dedication, and an ongoing direct line of communication so that the CEO can tell you what’s most important at any point in time. The more your CEO trusts the venture team with what matters, the more effective that CVC team can be. In addition, CEO support can also galvanize internal resources to help CVC portfolio companies succeed. Early in our experience providing managed venture capital services for corporations, we worked with an organization that embodied this challenge. The key principals in the day-to-day role inside the corporation didn’t want to link the tactical transactions to the broader needs of their company. They just wanted to do deals they personally found interesting. Unfortunately, that’s not the job. Doing deals just because you like them is what angel investors do, not CVCs. Those employees were smart and motivated and had good intentions, but they weren’t setting themselves up for success in corporate venture capital. At the time, we didn’t have enough experience or gravitas to share our views forcefully enough to make a difference. Unsurprisingly, that program was shut down in relatively short order. In my experience, the best path to longevity requires ensuring that the CEO understands that he or she is the most important customer of the CVC and feels free to share changing priorities of the corporation. Petratis notes: Hardening this link doesn’t mean your CEO needs to serve on the venture fund’s investment committee or become a bottleneck for decisions; the CEO simply needs to be able to keep the CVC team informed on the direction of the corporation so they can focus on what matters and support the direction of the business.

https://medium.com/getdelta/crypto-roundup-november-20th-e01e11e5d6f0?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Major crypto developments for the week: Bitcoin ordinals see resurgence Over the last two weeks we’ve seen a major resurgence in activity around Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions, which are on-chain inscriptions of text, images, audio, and video natively on the Bitcoin blockchain. The chart below shows the percentage of Bitcoin’s overall fees that are made up by inscriptions, which is now at the highest level since the initial ordinals frenzy earlier this year. What are the implications of this for the Bitcoin network and market? Higher demand to utilize Bitcoin blockspace means higher transaction fees that must be provided to incentive miners to include transactions in a block. While this may not be ideal for a network user looking to conduct small transactions, this is good for miner revenues and increased mining activity, which ultimately translates to more security for the Bitcoin network and its holder base. It will be interesting to see if ordinals can continue their growth and how they will hold up relative to NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract platforms. Past performance is not an indication of future results JPMorgan utilizes Avalanche blockchain One major development that came out this week was the collaboration between JPMorgan’s Onyx and Apollo Global, to test a portfolio management program on Avalanche, connected by LayerZero’s cross chain technology. This proof-of-concept will showcase bringing the wealth management industry on-chain. The collaboration, under the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be entitled Project Guardian and according to the project’s website, aims to “test the feasibility of applications in asset tokenization and DeFi while managing risks to financial stability and integrity”. Blackrock officially files ETH ETF One big piece of news came as Blackrock, the largest digital asset manager officially filed for an Ethereum ETF (exchange traded fund) in partnership with iShares. This should come as no surprise, as last week we highlighted that Blackrock had filed for a trust entity in Delaware for this official filling. If approved, the ETF will be listed on the Nasdaq and utilize Coinbase as the designated custodian. This marks a continued push into the digital asset space from the financial giant. HODLers trend continues: Bitcoin that hasn’t moved in at least a year sets record high of 70% This week marked a fairly significant milestone for Bitcoin as over 70% of Bitcoin supply has now not been moved in at least a year for the first time in its history. This supports previous data points that we’ve highlighted to reflect the strong belief from Bitcoin’s holder base in the wake of crypto wide contagion and macro headwinds after its all-time highs in 2021. While higher prices will ultimately incentivize new sellers, with Bitcoin up over 100% in the same time period, it appears Bitcoin holders are not planning on offloading inventory at these price levels or any time soon. Past performance is not an indication of future results “Pro-Bitcoin” president elected in Argentina One of the biggest global headlines this week came as Javier Milei was elected as president of Argentina. Outspoken as a liberation that strongly opposes central banks, Milei plans to dollarize Argentina, but has spoken very positively Bitcoin. While there is reason to believe he may implement positive Bitcoin policies, time will tell, and given how vocal he has been about plans to dollarize the country, may not be quite as strong of a force for Bitcoin as some Bitcoin commentators have suggested. dYdX undergoes potential insurance fund exploit Overshadowing the announcement that all fees from dydX v4 would go to stakers, an attack on the protocol’s insurance fund took place this week. The attacker did this by taking massive leveraged long positions on YFI, driving up open interest from $0.8 million to $67 million in just a few days, thereby making FYI open interest higher than any other perpetual venue in crypto. Meanwhile a large amount of YFI spot selling triggered a liquidation cascade on dYdX, which dYdX was unable to liquidate efficiently and was ultimately forced to cover the losses of up to $9 million of the dYdX v3 insurance fund. It is unclear exactly if the same actor was on both the dYdX perpetual and spot side of the events, but there is reason to believe this may have been a targeted attack on dYdX’s insurance fund. According to dYdX founder Antonio Juliano, the organization has contacted the FBI to look into these events to determine whether there was criminal market manipulation intent.

https://medium.com/getdelta/crypto-roundup-november-13th-245f356ca13b?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"Major crypto developments for the week: BlackRock files for ETH ETF trust structure in the state of Delaware One of the biggest developments of this week came as BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, registered for an iShares Ethereum Trust in the state of Delaware on Thursday. In addition, Nasdaq filed a proposal to list and trade the Ethereum trust. This provides a stamp of institutional legitimacy for the second largest crypto asset by market and if approved, will enable investors from around the world to get access to Ethereum exposure in their portfolio in a traditional brokerage account Bitcoin’s Weekly RSI reaches “overbought” territory for the first time since April of 2021 Bitcoin’s weekly RSI (relative strength index) just entered “overbought territory” for the first time since April 2021. The RSI is a momentum-based indicator that measures the magnitude of relative price changes. While the RSI reaching levels above 70 may not be ideal for bulls to see in the short term, this could also be seen as a positive long-term sign that the market has shown this level of strength for the first time in 2.5 years. The number of Bitcoin addresses with over $1 million has breached 80,000 This week the number of Bitcoin addresses with over $1 million breached 80,000. While many of these addresses can be attributed to the same entity, Satoshi has arguably created more millionaires than any other person in history. On a similar note, after this recent rally the percentage of Bitcoin addresses in profit now sits at 80%. Stablecoin 90-day change flips positive for first time in 1.5 years as divergence between USDC and USDT grows This week the 90-day change in aggregated stablecoin supplies flipped positive for the first time in 1.5 years. This signals increased liquidity on-chain expressed through stablecoins and can be perceived as a sign of capital inflows. Meanwhile, looking at the total supplies of the two largest stablecoins, USDT and USDC, we can see a clear divergence. It is not clear exactly what has been driving this. With the divergence beginning after USDC briefly de-pegged during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, concerns around counterparty risk may be driving the decline in USDC. There are also theories that USDT is being swapped for USDC for redemptions, as Circle may be easier/more compliant for US based funds to redeem amidst regulatory uncertainty. While we can only theorize, the divergence is striking and deserves continued attention. Bitcoin transaction fees reach the highest level since Ordinals excitement Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are now the highest that they’ve been since the ordinals excitement back in May. This signals renewed interest and demand to utilize Bitcoin’s blockspace, with network users needing to increase the fees that they are willing to pay miners to get their transactions included in blocks. While marginally higher fees are not ideal for those conducting transactions, higher fees incentivize mining, and ultimately the security of the network.

https://medium.com/getdelta/crypto-roundup-november-6th-5b9665d85378?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"Major crypto developments for the week: Bitcoin posts second largest returning month of 2023 in October While history doesn’t always repeat, it often rhymes. The seasonality that we described in our first weekly report of October ended up coming to fruition, with October being the second best performing month of 2023 for Bitcoin, returning investors 28.52% over the 30 day stretch. 15-year anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper While it may not be relevant to price action, October 31st marked a significant event for the Bitcoin and digital asset industry broadly, with the 15 year anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper. The Bitcoin Whitepaper, written by anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, described the technical functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain and laid out the framework for how to think about the open source project. Fast forward 15 years, the whitepaper has encapsulated the minds of hundreds of millions of individuals around the world and marks a shift in the mental framework for digital scarcity and the potential evolution of the monetary system forever. For this, we say thank you Satoshi! Altcoin open interest relative to Bitcoin open interest climbs, signaling potential froth in the market One interesting metric to keep an eye on is the percentage of crypto futures open interest made up by altcoins relative to BTC and ETH. This has recently set 2023 highs over the last week, meaning there is more speculation on altcoins relative to the two leading digital assets in the futures market. While this time could be different, it is worth keeping in mind that this could potentially signal froth locally in the crypto market overall and specifically for alts. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Liquidity may soon re-enter crypto on-chain through stablecoins One interesting piece of data for longer term-oriented market participants is to look at the aggregated stablecoin supplies in crypto. The chart below totals the amount of stablecoins across all major issuers and then calculates the 90-day percentage change in that aggregated measure. As you can see, this has been creeping higher throughout the year and is on the verge of flipping positive, an indication that liquidity may soon reenter crypto on-chain through stablecoins. This will be confirmed by the metric flipping positive, which would show a net increase of stablecoins over the trailing 90 days. Past performance is not an indication of future results. HODL waves indicate strong belief from Bitcoin’s holder base One interesting data point to monitor is Bitcoin’s HODL waves, which visualize the amount of Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in set cohorts of time. Nearly 70% of Bitcoin’s supply has remained untouched in at least a year, which sits near all-time highs as over 88% has remained untouched in at least 3 months. While higher prices would incentivize new sellers, as shown during bull markets in the chart below, for the time being it doesn’t appear current price levels are enticing enough for the majority of Bitcoin’s holder base. US and Asia lead the way for bidding BTC as EU slows behind, shown by trading session premiums One interesting phenomenon that we’ve been observing over the last two weeks is by looking at cumulative returns for Bitcoin during different trading sessions. As shown in the chart below, the US has once again been leading the charge followed slightly behind by Asia. However, you can see there is a major delta between those two sessions at the EU, which has been drastically lagging behind. While this data point is not actionable alone, it gives some color as to where flows have been derived globally. Bitcoin put/call skew reaches lowest level of 2023 Looking over at the options market we can see that the 25-delta skew for Bitcoin has reached its lowest for the entirety of 2023. This means that call options are the priciest relative to put options that they’ve been all year. This signals that market sentiment has shifted towards the bullish, and/or market participants that are positioned bearishly are hedging their positioning. This is one piece of data from the derivatives market worth keeping an eye on that locally the market may be getting overly excited in the short term.

https://medium.com/getdelta/crypto-roundup-october-30th-be4cdd916883?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"Major crypto developments for the week: Quantity of HODLed Bitcoin surpasses quantity of Bitcoin on exchanges Previously, we have described the deep belief in Bitcoin as an asset, and how it is reflected by Bitcoin’s holder base throughout the bear market. An interesting way to illustrate this is to observe the amount of Bitcoin that has been HODLed — i.e., that hasn’t moved — in at least 10 years, relative to the amount of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges. The results are that there are now over 600,000 more HODLed Bitcoin (for at least 10 years) than there currently are on exchanges. Did you know? $BTC is part of eToro’s @CryptoPortfolio, which allows investors to participate in the broader crypto market’s potential for growth. Bitcoin’s correlation to gold reaches highest level since March as correlation to Nasdaq drops The seasonality that we described in our first weekly report of October has once again continued, with the last month having been the strongest for Bitcoin for the entirety of 2023; a strong divergence from the performance of major equity indices, including the Nasdaq. As shown in the lower pane of the chart below, Bitcoin’s weekly correlation is the lowest that it’s been since August of 2021. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Meanwhile, its correlation to gold is the highest that it has been since the banking crisis earlier this year, as shown in the image below. While it’s difficult to make conclusions based on a few weeks of data, it will be interesting to see if this persists and a potential shift in the behavior of Bitcoin as an asset and how it can be viewed within an investor’s portfolio. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Did you know? $BTC is also part of eToro’s @BitcoinWorldWide portfolio, designed to provide investors with a diversified exposure to the world of Bitcoin. dYdX chain goes live This week was a significant one for dYdX holders, with the launch of the long awaited dYdX chain. This creates new utility for the DYDX token, as it will be staked to secure the network, receive a portion of fees, and be involved with network governance moving forward. According to the dYdX foundation: “This is a significant change from ethDYDX, which is solely a governance token in dYdX v3, to DYDX, a native token powering the dYdX Chain, a standalone PoS blockchain network.” Vaneck releases report on Solana with $3,200 bull case An interesting report that came out this week was from VanEck, a multi-billion dollar institutional asset manager, who laid their investment thesis for Solana and its SOL token. The report describes their thesis for Solana’s high performance high throughput technical architecture and areas of market share that it may be able to capture relative to other protocols. Most notably, the report laid out their bear base and bull case for SOL, which included the headline number of a $3,200 bullish case for the asset by the year 2030. The report itself is yet another reflection of continued interest to get involved in crypto by traditional asset managers. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Did you know? $SOL is part of eToro’s @Scalable-Crypto portfolio, designed to provide investors with exposure to innovative and scalable blockchain projects. CME futures volumes reach highest level of 2023 Another interesting development came as futures volume on the CME reached the highest single day of trading throughout the entirety of 2023. This is an interesting dynamic to continue to monitor because traditional hedge funds and financial organizations are the types of entities that trade on the CME, as opposed to crypto natives that trade derivatives on crypto native venues such as Binance, OKX, Bybit, etc. This perhaps suggests that some traditional financial players have been dipping their toes in the Bitcoin market, potentially around the expectation of a Bitcoin ETF approval on the horizon. Past performance is not an indication of future results. This is also represented in looking at futures open interest in addition to volume, as shown in the image below. This represents the number of futures contracts outstanding as opposed to how many have been traded on a given day. Past performance is not an indication of future results. CME futures dominance reaches all-time highs On a similar note, we can also take this a step further and look at the percentage of Bitcoin’s overall futures open interest derived from CME, as opposed to crypto native venues that have historically dominated the Bitcoin derivatives landscape. We can see in the chart below that the percentage of Bitcoin futures open interest made up by the CME has reached an all time high of over 25%. This hints at a potential shift of market participants in Bitcoin/crypto that we may see as more traditional financial institutions become comfortable allocating/trading the asset class. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Bitcoin options open interest reaches all time highs relative to perpetual futures open interest Continuing with a look into the Bitcoin derivatives market, we see a similar spike in options volumes, reaching the highest level of single day trading volume in the whole of 2023, at roughly $350 million. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Bitcoin options open interest relative to perpetual futures open interest has reached all time highs this week. This is significant as it represents a market structure shift towards increasing usage of options relative to perpetual futures, which historically have been the most liquid tradable derivatives product in crypto. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Bitcoin implied volatility rises to highest levels since Q1 Implied volatility, which is the expected future volatility priced in through the options market, has reached the highest levels since the banking crisis earlier this year.

Past performance is not an indication of future results. Did you know? $BTC is part of eToro’s @Index-Coop portfolio, one of eToro’s Partner Portfolios series. Updated ETF deadlines This week James Seyffart from Bloomberg posted an updated table of the most important ETF deadlines to keep in mind moving forward. As you can see in the table below, the first batch of major ETF deadlines for the SEC to abide by comes on January 10th of next year, with Ark Invest’s final deadline. Next is a swath of several filings reaching their final deadlines on March 14th of next year, including Blackrock/iShares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, and Fidelity/Wise Origin. Earlier in the week we saw Blackrock file an addendum to their current ETF filing, a reflection that Bitcoin ETF filers have been in talks with the SEC on the specifics of their respective fillings. Bitcoin reclaims 200 week and 200 day moving averages Bitcoin has reclaimed both its 200 day and 200 week moving averages, and has soared past the crucial $34K level, which is the most significant resistance for Bitcoin in the near term. As indicated in the chart below, this level brings Bitcoin back within the $30k-$60k range that it traded in throughout 2021–2022. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Did you know? $BTC is part of eToro’s @CryptoCurrency portfolio, one of eToro’s Smart Portfolios series. NYAG sues Gemini and DCG over Gemini Earn Program One of the biggest stories of last week came on Thursday as New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Gemini Trust Company, Genesis and Digital Currency Group for allegedly defrauding over 230,000 investors out of over $1 billion. According to the press release from the NYAG, Gemini mis-represented its “Earn” program as low risk, when in reality funds contributed to Gemini Earn were utilized by Genesis to make risky loans to numerous entities throughout the digital asset industry, including overconcentration to failed hedge funds Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research. The suit also alleges that Genesis and DCG concealed the health of the organization’s balance sheet after taking substantial losses throughout mid-2022. SEC drops claims against Ripple Labs This week revealed another substantial development on the legal front, with the SEC dismissing its claims against Ripple executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen for allegedly violating securities laws in the distribution/sales of the XRP token. While the public sale of XRP was not deemed to be in violation of securities laws by the Southern District of New York, the court had deemed institutional sales to be unregistered securities in its July summary judgment decision. With the SEC now dropping these claims as well, the trial, which was set for early 2024, has now been cancelled. This marks a significant win for Ripple and XRP. Did you know? $XRP is part of eToro’s @FuturePayments portfolio, which is designed to explore the future of finance and emerging payment technologies. Stablecoins revealed to be 16th largest sovereign holder of US treasuries Stablecoins continue to solidify themselves as one of the clearest use cases of crypto, with roughly $120 billion of stablecoins in circulation despite the broader market decline. One interesting statistic from a recent presentation given by Castle Island’s Nic Carter is that of the top sovereign nation US treasury holders as of June 2023. In the chart below we can see that stablecoins, which are largely backed by US treasuries, in aggregate would be the 16th largest US treasury holder in the world. As stablecoins presumably grow over the coming years with individuals around the world looking for access to digital dollars, the importance of stablecoins as an entity for the sake of the US financial system will increase, and at some point over the coming years may be deemed “too big to fail”.

In the anime series, her appearance stays dependable with her in the current style character, yet with additional energy. Her garments are more intricate, highlighting baffling subtleties and striking models that incorporate the limitless potential consequences of development. The visual flight isn’t restricted to the essential characters alone. Minor characters, for example, Scott’s bandmates and, amazingly, the insidious exes he should make due, also go through huge changes. Each character is given a raised degree of separation and uniqueness using contorted looks and changed highlights.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access.

Beyond its captivating gameplay and imaginative world, Pokemon’s designs are deeply rooted in various cultures from around the globe. This article delves into the intricate web of cultural influences that have shaped the diverse and inclusive Pokemon universe. Pokemon originated in Japan, a country rich in tradition and folklore. The early Pokemon designs drew inspiration from Japanese mythology, creatures, and nature. Characters like Pikachu and Charizard had subtle nods to Japanese legends, emphasizing the connection between the game and its cultural roots. As Pokemon evolved, so did its design influences. Developers began incorporating elements from cultures worldwide, resulting in a diverse array of Pokemon species. Take, for example, Ninetales, a majestic fox Pokemon inspired by Japanese and Chinese folklore. Its design showcases the elegance and mystery of mythical fox creatures in these cultures. From the fiery inspiration behind Charmander to the graceful influence of Koi fish in Gyarados, Pokemon designs span continents, celebrating the beauty of cultural diversity. Whether it’s the regal charm of Gardevoir influenced by European fairy tales or the vibrant hues of Ludicolo inspired by Mexican folklore, each Pokemon species tells a story rooted in the rich tapestry of global heritage. One of the remarkable aspects of Pokemon is its commitment to inclusivity. The diverse range of Pokémon designs represents various cultures, ethnicities, and mythologies.

Ten years later, you’ll probably say, “Gosh, I haven’t heard that name in years.” There are no hypes that last forever. Every single business or venture will decline one day or another. I’ve written an article analyzing how Google Bard will destroy ChatGPT because it’s a long-term game, and Google has the upper hand in terms of market dominance. ChatGPT has a better product, but that doesn’t mean they’ll win the long race. This was quite the trending article reaching 178,000 people. There were quite the mixed emotions towards it. Some agreed that Google had the upper hand. Others think that ChatGPT has a “first-movers advantage.” Now let’s resume the conversation.

When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly. Etsy is another marketplace and probably the best for selling your AI prompts. They get more than 454 million visitors every month, and these are all potential buyers for your products. Now, If you’ve ever tried selling on Etsy and made no sales, it’s probably one of two things But that won’t be the case for our AI prompts. Because Plus, it’s so obvious that the demand is there. So you can sell AI prompts on Etsy to make passive income. In fact, some people were smart enough to get in on this very early and are already making thousands of dollars. For a clear picture of how much you can make with this side hustle, I found 2 Etsy shops selling their AI prompts. First, we have purrfect city, And at an average price of $3.43 per prompt, this shop has made well over $9,312 passively. I also found a shop called Guide pro And at an average price of $4.99 per prompt pack, this shop has made $9,585 in passive income. My point is, AI isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay. You either adapt or get left behind. And Prompting is one of the best skills you can learn in this day and age. So if you’ve been looking for a way to get a piece of the AI pie, here’s your chance. Start your AI prompt shop today. Remember, Midjourney is just one of the AI tools you could be creating prompts for. The Prompting Class I showed you guys is for Midjourney & Midjourney is not free. It costs $10 per month but I believe it’s worth it. Once you learn how to create these prompts, you can launch your own prompt shop, or even take this side hustle one step further. Use your prompting skills to make money in various other ways. For example, you can So you learn the skill once and you’ll keep making money from your knowledge. So consider this side hustle and start improving your AI prompting skills on YouTube or with Ken Bluttman’s AI art Prompting Class.

Leonardo.ai offers a huge selection of trained models. From Stable DiffusionXL to special models for logos and illustrations — the choice is huge. MidJourney simply can’t keep up. One of the biggest advantages of Leonardo.ai is the ability to train your own AI models. Think of it like a personal AI trainer tailored to your exact needs. You set the direction and the AI ​​follows your creative path. This isn’t just a feature; it’s a revolution in the way you approach creative projects. You can train models for specific tasks or styles, be it photorealism, abstract art, or even complex 3D textures. The tool gives you granular control over every aspect of the training process, from selecting data to fine-tuning parameters. This means that not only do you get a final product that meets your expectations, but you also have control over the entire creative process. At MidJourney? There is no such thing. You are limited to prefabricated models and have little scope for individual adjustments. In short, while Leonardo.ai gives you the tools to create your own AI art gallery, MidJourney just lets you stroll through the exhibition. "

But, according to researchers from Cornell University, the now once-thought as highly secure solution hides a troublesome truth that could cause huge privacy concerns. Also, this discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today. If there’s a ubiquitous element in today’s frontier AI, that is embeddings. Embeddings sit at the core of models like ChatGPT, and almost all progress made over the last years in AI can be traced down one way or another to these elements.

By that point, the COVID (or, as we called it back then, novel coronavirus) pandemic had broken loose in China and started to spread to other countries. There were reports of cruise ships in Japan, possible cases on the West Coast, and outbreaks in Italy. Everybody knew that something big was coming, and our minds raced to imagine what it would be like. What did you think the pandemic would be like? How accurately were you able to envision it? Here’s what I remember anticipating, a pastiche cobbled together from movies I’d seen, news accounts, and analysis I saw on the internet (some of it expert, some of it less so): "

I started posting on MySpace in 2006. At first, I felt posting inspirational quotes and memes was the way to go. That got boring quickly. I had an adorable baby girl, but you can only post so many pics of your child. Switching gears toward posting funny status updates and memes got me a large following. I had over 18,000 followers on Myspace and then close to 5000 on Facebook. I’ve seen a LOT of posts in 17 years on social media. I still enjoy pics of puppies and kitties. I love funny memes. Cute kid pics of their first day of school, graduation, etc. I love hearing about people getting promotions, working toward goals, and supporting social justice. However, there’s a flip side. There are things I’ve seen SO MANY TIMES, it’s become cringe-worthy. I shudder every time I see posts about the following things and often throw up a little in my mouth. Here are the types of social media posts that drive me crazy. This has to be one of the oldest ones out there. I can remember seeing duck-face poses way back on MySpace. There is nothing cute or sexy about these poses. This is so 2005, let it die a respectful, quiet death, already. It’s pretty funny that young girls still use this one. It’s been used so long, that daughters could actually go back to their mother’s old social media posts and see that Mom was doing this before they were. I’d never want to repeat some trend my parents used back in the day. It just seems wrong. Jesus Murphy. Takes one to know one, I guess. I was a licensed real estate agent for 20 years. Do you know how… "

It reminds me of one of the most difficult things I’ve ever gone through: Not being able to put my daughter to bed every night of her childhood. Divorce is never an easy thing. When two people decide it’s time to finally pull the plug on their time together, it’s quite emotional and difficult. Much more so when a child is involved. I remember this event from 2007 in vivid detail. Things were never easy in her mother and my ten-and-a-half-year relationship. We were really young when we first were together. I actually had no business dating her. She was a senior in high school and I was a completely inexperienced 21-year-old young man who still attended church three times a week. I’d never had a girlfriend. I’d never even kissed a girl. When I say inexperienced, I mean INEXPERIENCED. I remember almost pulling the plug on our 3-week-old relationship back in 1996. Her best friend talked me out of it. I didn’t enjoy the drama and arguing we already had going on in between the getting along and fun times. But I was patient and agreed to work on it. We married a year after we started dating. This was way too young for two kids to be working on a marriage. However, due to the religious beliefs of my parents, I thought that being married was better than living in sin. I think back now and realize how dumb it was to be pressured into that. But we did our best, considering what common sense we had at that stage of our lives. We almost split up 4 years later. I was ready to call it quits while we were in college. I had a good friend I’d met that year and she drove a wedge between me and my wife. While she never acted inappropriately toward me and we never cheated together, I had a feeling she’d be waiting on the other side of a new divorce. "

Since then, the social network (now officially called X) has gone through a rapid series of transformations, few of them good. Musk fired most of his staff, messed with the verification system that allowed people to find trusted sources of information, boosted his own signal, limited the reach of sites he considers rivals or critics, and boosted misinformation. The company’s metrics are terrible — users, revenue, and advertising have been in freefall since Musk took over. Twitter is very bad now, and it will likely only get worse. Are you still on it? You should probably not be on it. But where should you go? Over the past year, a number of microblogging platforms have emerged. There now seem to be three serious alternative platforms, along with a fourth very tempting choice. So what are the pros and cons of each? Bluesky emerged from a project involving Twitter’s old CEO, Jack Dorsey, who envisioned a social network that looked like Twitter but was open and decentralized. The platform is run by a “public benefit corporation” that, at least on paper, exists to produce beneficial social outcomes rather than just to make a pile of money for its shareholders. Here’s the deal with Bluesky: it’s great but small. They’re still in beta, which means they don’t let just anybody sign up — you have to have an invite code from an existing user or get on a waitlist. I spent several months on the waitlist, so long, in fact, that I had forgotten about Bluesky when I finally got the invitation email. There seem to be about a million users on Bluesky right now. The people who run the platform seem to be focusing on slow, sustainable growth, but they risk staying too small for too long and missing the great Twitter exodus. On the flipside, many of the people who have enjoyed the smallness of Bluesky worry that, as it expands, it will become a home for the anger and ignorance that have infected Twitter. On Twitter, I followed a lot of academics (mostly history and political science… "

If you are looking to replace or upgrade your heating equipment, you should probably get a heat pump. Heat pumps are incredibly efficient and, most importantly, they’re electric, which means that they can operate without fossil fuels. Replacing as many gas and oil furnaces as possible with heat pumps should be a key part of the country’s — and the world’s — climate strategy. The good news is that, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the government will give you a sweet tax rebate if you install a heat pump in your home. The bad news is that nobody really understands how this works, as encapsulated in this excerpt from a recent New York Times article: I had a similar experience. In January, I jumped at the chance to install a heat pump in my home (we’re keeping the gas furnace for backup on days when the temperature gets below 15 degrees, which should only happen 10–15 times a year where I live). I was excited to take advantage of the new tax credits from the IRA. I met with several installers, at least two of whom specialized in heat pumps. I thought these guys would come in with a clear sense of how the IRA discounts worked, but they didn’t. One of them had even attended several government-run seminars on the new law, but said that he still wasn’t exactly sure how the program would actually work. "

I’m also doing an afternoon session for middle-schoolers at the Stratford Public Library. Politics always requires coalitions. In parliamentary democracies, the coalitions are visible, when they come together to form the government. In a dictatorship, the coalitions are hidden to everyone except infighting princelings and courtiers (until a general or minister is executed, exiled or thrown in prison.) In a two-party system, the coalitions are inside the parties — not quite as explicit as the coalition governments in a multiparty parliament, but not so opaque as the factions in a dictatorship. Sometimes, there are even explicit structures to formalize the coalition, like the Biden Administration’s Unity Task Force, which parceled out key appointments among two important blocs within the party (the finance wing and the Sanders/Warren wing). Conservative politics are also a coalition, of course. As an outsider, I confess that I am much less conversant with the internal power-struggles in the GOP and the conservative movement, though I’m trying to remedy that. Books like Nathan J Robinson’s Responding to the Right present a great overview of various conservative belief-systems: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/14/nathan-robinson/#arguendo And the Know Your Enemy podcast does an amazing job of diving deep into right-wing beliefs, especially when it comes to identifying fracture lines in the conservative establishment. A recent episode on the roots of contemporary right-wing antisemitism in the paleocon/neocon split was hugely informative and fascinating: https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/know-your-enemy-in-search-of-anti-semitism-with-john-ganz/ Political parties are weak institutions, liable to capture and hospitable to corruption. General elections aren’t foolproof or impervious to fraud, but they’re miles more robust than parties, whose own leadership selection processes and other key decisions can be made in the shadows, according to rules that can be changed on a whim: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/30/weak-institutions/ Which means that parties are brittle, weak vessels that we rely on to contain the volatile mixture of factions who might actually hate each other, sometimes even more than they hate the other party. Remember the defenestration of GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy? That: https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-327e294a39f8de079ef5e4abfb1fa555 Even outsiders like me know that there’s a deep fracture in the Republican Party, with Trumpists on one side and the “establishment” on the other side. Reading accounts of the 2016 GOP leadership race, I get the distinct impression that Trump’s win was even more shocking to party insiders than it was to the rest of us. Which makes sense. They thought they had the party under control, knew where its levers were and how to pull them. For us, Trump’s win was a terrible mystery. For GOP power-brokers, it was a different kind of a nightmare, the kind where you discover that controls to the the car you’re driving in high-speed traffic aren’t connected to anything and you’re not really the driver. But as Trump’s backers — another coalition — fall out among each other, it’s becoming easier for the rest of us to understand what happened. Take FBI informant Peter Thiel’s defection from the Trump camp: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel was the judas goat who led tech’s reactionary billionaires into Trump’s tent, blazing a trail and raising a fortune on the way. Thiel’s support for Trump was superficially surprising. After all, Thiel is gay, and Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, openly swore war on queers of all kinds. Today, Thiel has rebuffed Trump’s fundraising efforts and is reportedly on Trump’s shit-list. But as a Washington Post report — drawing heavily on gossiping anonymous insiders — explains. Thiel has never let homophobia blind him to the money and power he stands to gain by backing bigots: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel bankrolled Blake Masterson’s Senate race, despite Masterson’s promise to roll back marriage equality — and despite the fact that Masterton attended Thiel’s wedding to another man. According to the post, the Thiel faction’s abandonment of Trump wasn’t driven by culture war issues. Rather, they were fed up with Trump’s chaotic, undisciplined governance strategy, which scuttled many opportunities to increase the wealth and power of America’s oligarchs. Thiel insiders complained that Trump’s “character traits sabotaged the policy changes” and decried Trump’s habit of causing “turmoil and chaos…that would interfere with his agenda” rather than “executing relentlessly.” For Trump’s base, the cruelty might be the point. But for his backers, the cruelty was the tactic, and the point was money, and the power it brings. When Trump seemed like he might use cruel tactics to achieve power, his backers went along for the ride. But when Trump made it clear that he would trade opportunities for power solely to indulge his cruelty, they bailed. That’s an important fracture line in the modern American conservative coalition, but it’s not the only one. Writing in the BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller and Lee Hepner describes the emerging conservative split over antitrust and monopoly: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/is-there-an-establishment-plan-to Antitrust has been the centerpiece of the Biden Administration’s most progressive political project. For the left wing of the Dems, blunting corporate power is seen as the necessary condition for rolling back the entire conservative program, which depends on oligarch-provided cash infusions, media campaigns, and thinktank respectability. But elements of the right have also latched onto antitrust, for reasons of their own. Take the Catholic traditionalists who see weakening corporate power as a path to restoring a “traditional” household where a single breadwinner can support a family: https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-capitalism-becomes-tyranny-with-sohrab-ahmari There’s another reason to support antitrust, of course — it’s popular. There are large, bipartisan majorities opposed to monopoly and in favor of antitrust action: https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Antitrust_Policy_poll_results.pdf Two-thirds of Americans support anti-monopoly laws. 70% of Americans say monopolies are bad for the economy. The Biden administration is doing more on antitrust than any presidency since the Carter years, but 52% of Americans haven’t heard about it: https://www.ft.com/content/c17c35a3-e030-4e3b-9f49-c6bdf7d3da7f There’s a big opportunity latent in the facts of antitrust’s popularity, and the Biden antitrust agenda’s obscurity. So far, the Biden administration hasn’t figured out how to seize that opportunity, but some Dems are trying to grab it. Take Montana Senator John Tester, a Democrat in a Trump-voting state, whose campaign has taken aim at the meat-packing monopolies that are screwing the state’s ranchers. The right wants in on this. At a Federalist Society black-tie event last week during the National Lawyer’s Convention, Biden’s top antitrust enforcers got a warm welcome. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s top antitrust cop, was praised onstage by Todd Zywicki, whom Stoller and Hepner call “a highly influential law professors,” from George Mason Univeristy, a fortress of pro-corporate law and economics. Zywicki praised the DoJ and FTC’s new antitrust guidelines — which have been endlessly damned in the WSJ and other conservative outlets — as a reasonable and necessary compromise: https://fedsoc.org/events/national-press-club-event Even Lina Khan — the bogeywoman of the WSJ editorial page — got a warm reception at her fireside chat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwdAxOSznE And the convention’s hot Saturday ticket was “a debate between two conservatives over whether social media platforms had sufficient monopoly power that the state could regulate them as common carriers”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwoO7bZajXk This is pretty amazing. And yet…lawmakers haven’t gotten the memo. During markup for last week’s appropriations bill, lawmakers inserted a flurry of anti-antitrust amendments into the must-pass legislation: https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/fsgg-approps-bill-must-support-enforcers-not-kneecap-them/# These amendments were just wild. Rep Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) introduced an amendment that would give companies carte blanche to stick you with unlimited junk fees, and allow corporations to take away their workers’ rights to change jobs through noncompetes: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/269 Another amendment would block the FTC from enforcing against “unfair methods of competition.” Translation: the FTC couldn’t punish companies like Amazon for using algorithms to hike prices, or for conspiring to raise insulin prices, or its predatory pricing aimed at killing small- and medium-sized grocers. An amendment from Rep Kat Cammack (R-FL) would kill the FTC’s “click to cancel” rule, which will force companies to let you cancel your subscriptions the same way you sign up for them — instead of making you wait on hold to beg a customer service rep to let you cancel. Another one: “a provision to let auto dealers cheat customers with undisclosed added fees”: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr4664rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr4664rh.pdf Dems got in on the action, too. A bipartisan pair, Rep Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep Lou Correa (D-FL), unsuccessfully attempted to strip the Department of Transport of its powers to block mergers, which were most recently used to block the merger of Jetblue and Spirit: https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/640 And 206 Republicans voted to block the DoT from investigating airline price-gouging. As Stoller and Hepner point out, these reps serve constituents from low-population states that are especially vulnerable to this kind of extraction. This morning, Jim Jordan hosted a Judiciary Committee meeting where he raked DOJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter over the coals, condemning the same merger guidelines that Zywicki praised to the Federalist Society: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jxc8dp8erhe1q3wpndre/GOP-oversight-hearing-memo-11.13.23.pdf?rlkey=d54ur91ry3mc69bta5vhgg13z&amp;dl=0 Jordan’s prep memo reveals his plan to accuse Kanter of being an incompetent who keeps failing in his expensive bids to hold corporate power to account, and being an all-powerful government goon who’s got a boot on the chest of American industry. Stoller and Hepner invoke the old Yiddish joke: “The food at this restaurant is terrible, and the portions are too small!” Stoller and Hepner close by wondering what to make of this factional split in the American right. Is it that these members of the GOP Congressional caucus just haven’t gotten the memo? Or is this a peek at what corporate lobbyists home to accomplish after the 2024 elections? They suggest that both Democrats and Republican primary contesters in that race could do well by embracing antitrust, “Establishment Republicans want you to pay more for groceries, healthcare, and travel, and are perfectly fine letting monopoly corporations make decisions about your daily life.” I don’t know if Republicans will take them up on it. The party’s most important donors are pathologically loss-averse and unwilling to budge on even the smallest compromise. Even a faint whiff of state action against unlimited corporate power can provoke a blitz of frenzied scare-ads. In New York state, a proposal to ban noncompetes has triggered a seven-figure ad-buy from the state’s Business Council: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/noncompete-campaign-raises-state-lobbying-18442769.php It’s hard to overstate how unhinged these ads are. Writing for The American Prospect, Terri Gerstein describes one: “a hammer smashes first an alarm clock, then a light bulb, with shards of glass flying everywhere. An ominous voice predicts imminent doom. Then, for good measure, a second alarm clock is shattered”: https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-10-business-groups-reflexive-anti-worker-demagogy/ Banning noncompetes is good for workers, but it’s also unambiguously good for business and the economy. They “reduce new firm entry, innovation by startups, and the ability of new firms to grow.” 44% of small business owners report having been blocked from starting a new company because of a noncompete; 35% have been blocked from hiring the right person for a vacancy due to a noncompete. : https://eig.org/noncompetes-research-brief/ As Gerstein writes, it’s not unusual for the business lobby to lobby against things that are good for business — and lobby hard. The Chamber of Commerce has gone Hulk-mode on simple proposals to adapt workplaces for rising temperatures, acting as though permitting “rest, shade, water, and gradual acclimatization” on the jobsite will bring business to a halt. But actual businesses who’ve implemented these measures describe them as an easy lift that increases productivity. The Chamber lobbies against things its members support — like paid sick days. The Chamber complains endlessly about the “patchwork” of state sick leave rules — but scuttles any attempt to harmonize these rules nationally, even though members who’ve implemented them call them “no big deal”: https://cepr.net/report/no-big-deal-the-impact-of-new-york-city-s-paid-sick-days-law-on-employers/ The Chamber’s fight against American businesses is another one of those fracture lines in the conservative coalition. Working with far right dark money groups, they’ve worked in statehouses nationwide to roll back child labor laws: https://www.epi.org/blog/florida-legislature-proposes-dangerous-roll-back-of-child-labor-protections-at-least-16-states-have-introduced-bills-putting-children-at-risk/ They also fight tooth-and-nail against minimum wage rises, despite 80% of their members supporting them: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/04/leaked-documents-show-strong-business-support-for-raising-the-minimum-wage/ The spectacle of Republicans in disarray is fascinating to watch and even a little exciting, giving me hope for real progressive gains. Of course, it would help if the Democratic coalition wasn’t such a mess.

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

This is not unique to the Hamas attack. The older you are, the more likely you are to be pro-Israel: In March 2022, 69% of Americans over 65 had a favorable view of Israel, while just 41% of those under 29 did. Worries about increasing antisemitism in the U.S. are similarly correlated: 85% of seniors say it’s growing; 52% of Gen Zers say it’s not. Young people are resistant to the views of their elders. And that’s a good thing. As kids enter adolescence, they develop a healthy gag reflex triggered by anything associated with their parents. This helps them develop their own opinions and beliefs about the world, and it’s also good for the parents, because by the time kids are 18, they can be such assholes that everyone’s ready for them to leave the house. But that doesn’t explain students at my employer (NYU) holding up protest signs reading “keep the world clean” with images of the Star of David in trash cans. I’d like to think this is a fringe view, but when 51% of their cohort believe the murder of 1,200 people is justified, something more serious is happening. Young people’s attitudes about Israel have been hardening for some time: Months before October 7, a majority of Americans under 43 were more sympathetic to the Palestinians than the Israelis. Yet during that time, U.S. policy has remained staunchly pro-Israel, and American media generally favorable toward Israeli interests. That gap is widening into a gulf, between establishment views and those of young people. All of which made me think of … Dresden. In 1945 the U.S. and British air forces rained 4,000 tons of high-explosive bombs on the German city of Dresden for 48 hours straight. The attack was militarily advantageous. It impeded German troop movement, destroyed a key city center, inflicted heavy German casualties, and, as the officers of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey put it, “left the German people with a solid lesson in the disadvantages of war.” It also destroyed acres of historical and culturally priceless art and architecture and killed 25,000 civilians. The Allies considered it such a success that a month later the U.S. repeated the tactic at an even greater scale on the other side of the globe, destroying 16 square miles of central Tokyo and killing 100,000 civilians — making March 9, 1945, the deadliest night in human history. Four months after that, Truman ordered the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Contemporary assessments and public opinion in the U.S. focused on the military advantage gained from these attacks, and little mention was made of the horrific human toll. It had no measured impact on U.S. support for the war or those prosecuting it. What would have happened if the people of Dresden had had TikTok? The same TikTok that is serving me dozens of videos from Gaza, epitomized by a couple taking cover with their innocent child from Israeli bombs. Around them only rubble. Heartbreaking. Heartbreaking enough to make you hate those behind the bombs, whatever their flag or justification. For most of modern history, governments and elites have had outsized influence on the narrative, especially around foreign affairs. Outright, 1984-style control is unnecessary, when words, sounds, and images are only accessible through controlled channels. Corporate ownership of media, access journalism, and bias go a long way in choosing what stories to cover and how to frame them. The exceptions prove the rule. When contrary evidence breaks into public awareness, the impact can be profound. Just three photos shifted U.S. public opinion against the Vietnam war more than thousands of dead American soldiers or lost battles: the 1968 image of a South Vietnamese General shooting a prisoner in the head, the 1970 picture of Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling over the body of a Kent State classmate, and the 1972 image of a naked girl fleeing napalm. If you are over 50, you likely can recall these images just by closing your eyes. If you are over 70, you don’t need to close your eyes. Regimes that lose control of the narrative lose power soon after. The shift in American opinion about Vietnam brought down LBJ. The Gulag Archipelago fatally undermined the Soviet Union’s historical and moral narrative. Ayatollah Khomeini’s taped sermons brought down the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran. All governments seek to shape the narrative. Vietnam was called the “living room war” because media, especially television, brought it home in ways that newsreels never did during World War II or the Korean War. The lesson the U.S. military took from the experience was a simple one: It had to regain control of the narrative. It implemented a system of “embedding” journalists within military units, which, of course, meant what the journalists saw and how it was presented to them fell largely under government control. Embedding put the genie back in the bottle for a generation. But social media, especially the short-form video format popularized by TikTok, has shattered the bottle. Young Americans spend at least 10% of their waking hours on TikTok, and 76% of 18- to 24-year-old Americans are TikTok users, compared to 7% of Americans 65 and older. That’s time they are not spending watching CNN or reading the Wall Street Journal. And on TikTok, the scale and reach of pro-Palestine content dramatically outweighs pro-Israel content. As of this week, videos tagged #StandWithPalestine have received more than 10 times the views of videos tagged #StandWithIsrael — 324 million vs. 3.4 billion. One TikTok user reported that his stream turned rabidly anti-Israel once he started engaging with such posts, and Jewish creators on the platform are reporting escalating harassment. This is cause and effect. Young Americans (see above) are already drifting away from the attitudes of their parents’ generation (my generation) toward the conflict. Young Americans are more diverse than older Americans, and presumably more sympathetic to non-white groups such as Palestinians. And if mostly what you know about Israel-Palestine is Gaza post-2006 and bulldozed houses in the West Bank, your views are likely going to be different from those of someone whose frame of reference includes the Yom Kippur War and Munich. Young people are more prone to make pro-Palestinian content, more prone to consume it, and the wheel turns. Access to more viewpoints and more sources of information is a good thing on balance. Despots should not be allowed to disappear their people any more than democracies should be able to firebomb someone else’s, and the unflinching testimony of a livestream can help stop them. But an unbounded information landscape is not an unalloyed good. Because social media does not favor accuracy or balance or diversity. It favors clicks. The more engaging and enraging the content, the more clicks it receives. Is the image I get of Gaza on TikTok more accurate or true than what I see on CNN? In some cases, yes. But on social media, accuracy is incidental. This presents, I believe, two profound risks. Sam Harris said you become where you spend your time. We were discussing Twitter on my podcast — I was addicted to it at the time, and I had noticed I’d become more curt, venal, and reactionary. Also, I was having thoughts in 140 characters (no joke). He pointed out that humans are more influenced by our environments than we’d like to think. If I spend 5% of my waking hours getting angry on Twitter, I become a 5% angrier individual. Same is true if I spend more time with my kids expressing and receiving love. We become where we spend our time. (Side note: I am no longer using Twitter.) (Another side note: still angry and curt.) Just as my addiction to Twitter made me more like what I consumed there — sputtering angry hot takes — spending time on the TikTok of #standwith___ has a predictable effect. The conflict, generations old and woven into the fabric of global politics, is reduced to suffering, anger, and violence. There is a good side and a bad side. Instinctive tribalism kicks in, and young people walk through Washington Square Park with images of the Star of David in the trash, and a 6-year-old Muslim boy is stabbed by his landlord. Social media algorithms identify our politics and then shepherd us into a hermetically sealed bubble, framing our worldview through a window of rage and extremism. We know the first risk is real, and it’s playing out — you can see it on your phone and in the street. Our discourse is more coarse, our focus increasingly on what divides us. The second risk is more insidious, visible only in outline. But those outlines are coming into sharp relief. There is a nonzero probability that TikTok is being manipulated and leveraged by the CCP to sow division in America. That probability is high. It’s what we would do and have done. In the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a variety of covert actions aimed at fomenting internal strife. Radio Free Europe, a CIA-backed initiative, broadcast pro-democracy messaging into the Eastern Bloc to encourage dissent. During World War II, Nazi Germany dropped leaflets over American troops that highlighted racial injustices in the U.S., hoping to demoralize troops and incite racial tension. Every nation has done, or is doing, this … actively. The U.S. itself continues to pursue such tactics to this day. The U.S. Army’s 4th Psychological Operations Group describes itself as follows: The CCP has control over the most powerful, yet elegant, weapon in the history of propaganda, and the default position is they (i.e., the CCP) are not using it? I have stated this view before. China cannot beat us kinetically or economically, but it can beat us by tearing us apart from the inside. TikTok, in my view, has the potential effect of several carrier strike forces. A 21st century Trojan Horse that also generates $100 billion in annual revenue. I was at the White House this week for an AI Summit. Government officials are not allowed to be on TikTok for security reasons. This comes at a cost, as I believe they’d be more alarmed at the skew of information. It’s a common misconception that propaganda is like advertising: a barrage of messaging favoring one side or attacking another. Uncle Sam telling you to buy war bonds or black-and-white movies of Aryan youth saluting the swastika. That’s not how China would use (is using) TikTok. The more elegant strategy is to atomize the enemy (us). Find small differences of opinion and broaden them. Carve off slices of support for a long-time ally, one demographic group at a time. The Nazi propagandist Goebbels wrote that the purpose of propaganda is to generate “volcanic passions, outbreaks of rage, to set masses of people on the march, to organize hatred and despair with ice-cold calculation.” Xi Jinping has described the Internet as “the main battlefield in the battle for public opinion,” and in 2013 he said, “online public opinion work should be taken as the top priority of propaganda and ideological work. Many people, especially young people, do not read mainstream media and get most of their information from the Internet. We must face up to this fact, increase investment, and seize the initiative on this battlefield of public opinion as soon as possible. [We must] become experts in using new means and methods of modern media.” ByteDance employees have confirmed the CCP has backdoor access to American TikTok user data, which it has used several times. In addition, the CCP has refused to let TikTok’s parent company ByteDance go public for national security reasons. FBI officials have themselves stated TikTok could be used as an “aggressive weapon” against the U.S. and China’s enemies at large. In sum, the CCP’s manipulation of TikTok is hiding in plain sight. The CCP’s Oppenheimer moment was the fusion of TikTok and October 7. Or maybe I’m being paranoid and am out of touch with a generation reacting to an Israel that has veered rightward. Maybe an increasingly non-white population has an easier time recognizing oppression. Or maybe we live in a social media era in which views are ushered to their most extreme on their own without interference from state actors. Maybe. Life is so rich, P.S.

Unlike his former peers in the “scale of impact” community, Bendell offers no amazing science fiction fantasy technosolutionist fix for the climate crisis. Instead, he offers a set of strategies for how to adapt to the inevitable. Jem Bendell was a Professor of Sustainability Leadership at University of Cumbria, who came to realize that climate change was inevitable, and the collapse of modern industrial consumer societies was already underway. However, by fully experiencing the sadness and despair, he realized he wanted to “live to the max“ in this new context, and wrote a controversial paper in 2018 called Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy. He followed that up with a book called Deep Adaptation, and the brand new book I read for this conversation, Breaking Together: A Freedom-Loving Response to Collapse. What’s coming is bad, but it’s not all bad. A combination of realistic acceptance along with hope and resilience could help inflect the quality of the experience ahead. Think of it like the serenity prayer: grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Here’s a snippet of my conversation with Jem Bendell. You can hear the whole thing by clicking on the link. Douglas Rushkoff:Part of what interests me about your story is your move away from both the university as well as the top-down, official, global United Nations type organizations for sustainable development.

Despite popular opinion, it is one of the safest and lowest carbon forms of energy. It is also one of the few on-demand forms of low-carbon energy. As such, it will be a crucial technology as we transition to net-zero. However, the nuclear industry faces a massive problem: it costs too much. New nuclear power plants cost tens of billions of dollars and take well over a decade to build, and once built, the energy they produce is some of the most expensive on the market. This has led many governments and energy providers to distance themselves from this planet-saving technology. But a new type of reactor called an SMR promises to solve all of these issues and kick-start a nuclear renaissance, saving the nuclear industry. However, a pioneering SMR project has just been cancelled because costs are ballooning out of control. So, the question has to be asked: is the future of nuclear energy doomed? Possibly not. Let’s start at the beginning: what is an SMR? SMR stands for Small Modular Reactor. Typical nuclear power plants have several enormous custom-built reactors. These are incredibly complex and must be carefully and accurately assembled on-site. This skyrockets the construction cost and deployment time. SMRs solve this by using reactors small enough to be fully assembled off-site in a controlled factory and then shipped to the location. These reactors produce less power, so you need more of them, generally over 10, to make a power plant. However, the overall cost of these reactors per MW of power should be far cheaper than regular reactors, as the factory can use economies of scale to lower prices. Deployment should also be far quicker, as reactors can be built ahead of time, and their small nature and controlled production facility make construction far quicker. There is even a flexibility advantage, as an SMR plant can add or remove reactors quickly to better meet demand. Ordinary reactors take decades and billions of dollars to expand their output. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Several companies are pioneering SMR technology. But, the company spearheading the SMR movement is… "
https://medium.com/@warnermediaent/sitting-in-the-directors-chair-for-the-first-time-8f6f5bef86?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"As Executive Producer Sydney Fleischmann prepared for the fourth and final season of Room 104, HBO’s anthology series from the Duplass Brothers, she decided to shift gears a bit. Since the series debuted in 2017, Fleischmann has served as an integral part of the producing team. As the show blossomed, she grew with it, graduating from a logistical producer to overseeing the show’s creative vision alongside Mark Duplass. Heading into the last season of the show, Fleischmann dared herself to give directing a go. The final episode of the series marks her directorial debut. Below, the 30-year-old accomplished producer reflects on her experience putting on her director’s hat for the first time, her interpretation of the finale, and what’s in store for her after Room 104 ends. What was it like to have your directorial debut be the season finale? FLEISCHMANN: Directing was the best thing I think I’ve done on the show. I had never really thought about directing an episode because we’ve just had such incredible directors. I think they’ve all set the bar really high and it never quite felt right. At the core of the episode, it’s about a person at the end of his life reflecting back and thinking about decisions he made and decisions he wasn’t allowed to make. I have two 92-year-old grandfathers, both of whom I’m close with, one of whom I’m very close with. This episode is definitely not my grandfather’s story, but as I was preparing to direct it, I thought a lot about conversations I’ve had with him about how he views his life and the things he wishes he had done, things he wishes he hadn’t done. It’s a really profound thing to be able to look at your own mortality that way and look back on the whole story of your life. I think when I read the script, that’s what I thought of and it really resonated with me. I knew I wanted to direct this one. Mark [Duplass] was, as usual, incredibly supportive. The whole crew was super supportive. I don’t think I could have done it without the people who work on this show, because I trust them so deeply. I think that’s such a huge part of doing anything creative, having that trust and knowing you can be vulnerable and make mistakes. It’s comforting knowing people won’t write you off for it, but that they will help you get through the challenging moments and help you solve the problems. And so directing the finale felt like a collaboration. It was a really special experience to see the show from a different angle. I’ve seen it from the producer angle for 48 episodes and watched other directors direct It was a very illuminating experience to step into that role myself. The daughter says a line in the finale about how motels are places people stay “on their way to somewhere else. They weren’t home but at least they were safe with people they loved.” How did you decide to end the series with this line? We shoot the episodes in a totally different order. We shoot them in a way that makes sense for production, taking actors’ schedules and directors’ schedules into account. And then when we finish editing them, we look at all of the episodes and we say, “What order does it make sense to air them in?” This episode was not originally written as the finale, but when we started arranging the puzzle pieces of the series, it became clear it’d make the perfect ending to the series because it hits on the entire meaning of this motel room. It makes a statement about what motels are and what, without being too dramatic, what the human experience is. What’s next for you? Are you planning to take on more producer roles? Is directing something you want to keep doing? I’m definitely producing. I’m developing a couple projects right now that we’ll hopefully get to shoot at some point. There was something really special about the environment in which I got to direct on this show. I think for me that was such a big part of it, to have this really safe space to do it. I would definitely be open to directing again in that way with people I love and trust, which I guess is what anybody wants. Looking back, do you have any favorite episodes from the past four seasons? I think the one I really connected with in season two was the episode called “Josie and Me.” We made it at a time when I was trying to understand my own journey and how I would perceive my younger self at that moment. That’s what the story is about, a young woman following her college-aged self throughout the course of a night. I definitely relate to the story in terms of how you view yourself throughout time and how and why we rewrite our own histories. That one is definitely special to me. I think the content of it challenged me to think about something differently than I had before. What do you hope people take away from Room 104 as the series comes to a close? That is a good question. I think the takeaway is that there’s space for everyone. I hope we did a decent job of creating space for more people to tell their stories. I think that’s really important, to just know that there is space for all perspectives. For other filmmakers, a good takeaway is to work within limitations and aim to set those for yourselves. It’s more satisfying, creatively, to create something when you have restrictions. "
https://medium.com/warnermediaent/director-mutaali-hopes-yusuf-hawkins-storm-over-brooklyn-will-inspire-modern-activism-cb28ab8662da?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Filmmaker Muta’Ali knew he had found his next project upon learning about the political complexities and contemporary relevance of the 1980s murder of Yusuf Hawkins. The HBO documentary Yusuf Hawkins: Storm Over Brooklyn tells the story of Yusuf Hawkins, a sixteen-year-old Black teenager who was murdered by a white mob on August 23, 1989 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. The film details how this tragedy came to happen, how Hawkins’ family and friends dealt with their loss, and how Rev. Al Sharpton motivated a movement to demand justice for Hawkins. Below, Muta’Ali discusses his use of maps as a storytelling method, his gratitude for studios like HBO for taking chances on diverse voices, and what he hopes viewers can take away from Hawkins’ story. What drew you to tell the story of Yusuf and his family and the public reaction to his death? What drew me was a mixture of things. I think it’s important to remember our history, as New Yorkers and as a nation. And part of our history includes things that are tragic. Yusuf was a 16-year-old boy, innocent in almost every way that we can imagine, and his life was taken. I think having an opportunity to evoke his name and remind people that he existed was something that drew me to the project, as well as the circumstances surrounding his murder. To tell a story that unfolds the many factors that contributed to Yusuf’s murder — environmental factors, New York’s segregation at the time, the political climate, the way Mayor Koch led New York City during three terms prior to Yusuf’s murder — all of that is related to what happened on August 23rd, 1989. In the documentary, you use maps to lay out the story and to prepare the audience for what was to come. What led to that filmmaking decision? There is a theme of segregation peppered throughout the story. There’s a 2015 article by the New York Times called “Mapping Segregation.” It’s an interactive map where you can look down at the city and see where people live based on their race. When you look at the map, we are all sectioned off primarily by race in New York. And that’s not exclusive to 2015, that was also the case in 1989. This is sensitive data. The top-down look and the maps played several roles and one was to reinforce our separateness, but also to let people know who are outside of New York City how things are spaced out. I think, practically, that was a good move, but segregation is really what I wanted to underscore. How did you approach telling both sides of the story and gaining the trust of the subjects? We threw out a wide net, but there was a lot of reluctance on the part of the Bensonhurst residents. They did not feel comfortable, for the most part, contributing to the story. There’s still some fear in the atmosphere out there, like there might be some sort of repercussion if you talk about what happened to Yusuf. That was a little bit of a hindrance. For the people who did participate, including Joey Fama [currently in prison for the death of Yusuf Hawkins] and Russell Gibbons [the sole Black man involved with the mob that attacked Yusuf Hawkins], I appreciated their presence and their willingness to speak up. I feel like they wanted to let me know that not everyone out there had the same intentions or opinions about what happened. My intention was to paint a picture of the Bensonhurst residents as being just as diverse as people who are within their own ethnic enclaves and that everyone was an individual. The film includes interviews with the lone Black man involved with the mob that killed Hawkins, Russell Gibson. How does his characterization of Bensonhurst complicate the film’s narrative? I think it serves the film’s narrative in a way. What he offered wasn’t the perspective of a stereotypical African-American who would move into a white neighborhood when he was an adult. I think he adopted the same mentality as his white friends. He believes that racism was not an issue in Bensonhurst. As someone who really is opposed to racism- denial, it shows me that racism- denial is not limited to white people. Anyone can deny the existence of racism even though it’s right in their face. It’s a complicated issue, though, because he’s a Black person and I think that might be complicated for him to process on his own. I think people lean on Russell’s presence that night as a reason why this wasn’t a racist incident and why the attackers couldn’t have been racist. But I think when you listen to Russell, you see that he has about 100 percent the same mentality as everyone else he grew up with. One thing I think was great that he contributed was the reason his father decided to move to Bensonhurst in the first place, including job opportunities and better education. That lines up with the segregation of the time and the mayor’s treatment of different communities throughout the 1980s. The city invested more in communities where people were white or Italian and divested in communities like East New York. The film includes a clip of Spike Lee encouraging voter turnout in order to remove Mayor Koch from office. What role do you see voting playing in the fight for racial justice today? I think voting is important. I think that anybody who has a friend who’s convincing them that they shouldn’t vote needs to tell their friend that they’re sadly mistaken. And then when it comes to actually affecting our day-to-day, the rhetoric that our leaders use is important. They set the tone of our nation. It makes a huge difference if the person in the White House actually agrees that racism is a problem. As a Black person, fighting racism and giving Black people a fair shot is a priority. What lessons do you hope your viewers can take away from the film to make sure that these faults of the past don’t keep repeating themselves? How does this film relate to events you see going on today? I think one thing people can do is believe victims of oppression and racism. We have to believe Black people. This film wouldn’t happen without networks like HBO seeing the value in the story and entrusting the filmmakers. I really thank them. I want to tip my hat to studios that take the risk by creating content with filmmakers from diverse backgrounds and HBO has done that for a long time. With that, we’ll be able to look at what political leaders say with a dual mind. When our leaders make comments that deny that racism is a problem present in America, they are doing the same thing Ed Koch did in the 1980s that allowed racism to fester. So, we have the potential to be racist. We have the potential to be victims of racism. We, as individuals, need to make sure that we don’t accidentally participate in racist acts because we’ve been programmed to do so. We still live very siloed lives. In New York, especially in our school systems, we are very siloed by race. One thing we need to learn is that we are really susceptible to suggestions about other cultures. Since we’re not mixed together like a beautiful melting pot, we have to second guess our presumptions about other people, especially before we take action physically against them. I think the biggest lesson, though, that I hope people take away is that putting pressure on a community works, like Rev. Al Sharpton and Yusuf’s family did from August 1989 to January 1991 by marching through Bensonhurst 29 times. I think what they did will work today for Breonna Taylor. Continued protest in the neighborhood of the people who are in power is effective, so if people could take that away, I’d be delighted as a citizen. "

The festival will be hosted on ABFF.com from August 21–30, with more than 100,000 virtual attendees from around the globe anticipated to attend. As part of this year’s Short Film Competition, emerging writers and directors presented narratives that ranged from gut-wrenching tragedies to subversive comedies and a journey into self-exploration. Lanre Olabisi is an independent filmmaker whose films have screened in over 70 festivals, including SXSW and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival. Below, he shares how a retired African-American tennis player inspired his short film A Storybook Ending. Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition? It’s one of the best short film competitions in the world. ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition has done a wonderful job at launching the careers of so many talented filmmakers over the past twenty-plus years. A number of my friends have had films play in the festival and doors that had previously been closed to them started to swing wide open, so submitting to ABFF was really a no brainer. What inspired you to write this story? The idea came to me in 2015 when I saw what happened to James Blake, the retired African-American tennis star. He was standing in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City waiting for a car to take him to the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament. All of a sudden and for no apparent reason, a plainclothes police officer tackled Mr. Blake to the ground without ever identifying himself. I’m 6’2, 240 lbs. I wrestled at the University of Michigan. I’m a purple belt in Brazilan Jiu-Jitsu. I know how to defend myself and that moment actually scared me because I have always been aware that at some point in my life I might just “fit the description.” This led me to ask a number of questions that all started with: what if? What if that happened to me? What if I fought back? What if it was nighttime? What if no one was around? What if I threw the cop to the ground? Fortunately, I never went through any of this, but my main character, Wale, does. The short is actually based on a feature film that I wrote and I was looking to raise the profile of the feature film script. I saw what Damien Chazelle did with the short film for Whiplash which ultimately led to an amazing feature, so I was really inspired by that. What role do you think current events will play in the way your film is viewed? As the filmmaker, what do you hope your film adds to the conversation? Due to our current climate, I definitely think there are moments that are going to be triggering for some people. I don’t pretend to have the answers and the film doesn’t pretend to try to solve them. When I make a film I make a point of subverting stereotypical depictions, stories, and characteristics of people of color. I wish to show us (POC) in ways that we have not seen portrayed on film, by veering away from the usual expectations. With A Storybook Ending, I wanted to place a group of African-Americans in a situation that I have never seen on screen inside of a neo-noir dark comedy. I thought it would be fun to tackle this genre given the dearth of these types of stories with African-American leads. I really love what’s going on right now in TV and film. We are starting to see stories and roles open up that just wouldn’t have been fathomable even ten years ago. I can’t imagine seeing something like Watchmen or Us growing up, so seeing it start to happen in a meaningful way is refreshing. If this short film can add to that conversation in some small way, that would be amazing. In terms of genre, how do you categorize your film? How do you think comedy can be used to facilitate highlighting dark themes? A neo-noir dark comedy (with some action sprinkled in) that’s also part social satire. I like using comedy to highlight dark themes because it throws the audience off-balance. People open up when they laugh and once you do that, you can sock them with something really hard and extremely dark. If it’s dark all the way through then a wall forms between the audience and the film and there is the risk that they will not be able to fully engage with the film. Ultimately, I felt that it was important to lighten things up so that the audience could swallow what at the end of the day is a particularly dark story. What role did music play in the writing of this script? I found the song choices very interesting. I knew that I wanted the music to set the tone for the film very early. It puts the audience in a position where they know that the filmmakers are not taking things too seriously, so they don’t have to either. This helps because when the moments of levity do come, they feel free to laugh as opposed to being confused by a tonal shift in the film. When it came to choosing the music, I always knew that I was going to play with opposites. I love the musical choices Kubrick made with A Clockwork Orange and what Danny Boyle did with Trainspotting. Both films are very dark at times and the music often plays contrary to what we see onscreen. My thought was: what’s the least likely thing someone would expect to hear at this moment that could actually work for this scene? With that as the starting point, finding the right song became infinitely easier. What advice would you give aspiring filmmakers trying to break into the film industry? This is a marathon and not a sprint. Too many times I see aspiring filmmakers who give it a few years and then give up. If at some point someone decides this is not for them and they don’t want to do it anymore — there is nothing wrong with that. Go out and find what you love to do and do it. However, if you do discover that this is what you love to do, then push forward no matter how long it takes. Keep learning. Keep growing. Keep making films. Keep getting better. Things will open up, just be patient, for when that moment does come — you’ll be ready for it. "

International filmmaker Darius Dawson is a Los Angeles native. After undergrad, Darius went on to NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts Asia in Singapore for graduate film production, with a concentration in cinematography. Darius shares more about his experience transitioning from the advertising industry to directing A Rodeo Film. Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition? ABFF is a well-known festival, especially amongst Black filmmakers. It’s just something that I’ve always known about, so I knew I wanted to submit even before I made Rodeo. Last year my brother’s film, Gummi Bear, was part of the 2019 Emerging Directors Showcase. I AC’ed [Assistant Camera] another film, Blueberry, that was part of the same showcase, and one of my boys from AFI had his film, Outdooring, participate in the showcase that year as well. A lot of people around me have come through ABFF, so it just made sense. I think what attracted me to the HBO Competition specifically was the history of filmmakers that have participated; Ryan Coogler, Saladin K. Patterson, Steven Caple Jr. It seems like a place for Black creators to get their start and to get some recognition as well. Given that your film focuses on the very American rodeo experience, how did your experiences learning and working in Asia impact your work on A Rodeo Film? I think working abroad has really made me appreciate home. You remember things fondly when you have the luxury of distance or time between you and where you come from. It took living on the opposite side of the Earth for me to realize that what I’m most captivated by has been right here all along. I love stories in rural settings. I love stories about love and lust and characters that are flawed and don’t have all the answers. That’s the people I grew up with and myself. As far as rodeo being really American — it’s kind of funny because rodeos are pretty big in other places too: Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina. I think what’s uniquely American is the cowboy. The term cowboy was once a derogatory term for a Black ranch hand. Now it’s something that literally represents the United States. What inspired you to write this story? Do you have a personal relationship with the Rodeo and/or rural California? It all started a few years ago when I saw images from the Bill Pickett Invitational. I was taken by the images of people that looked like me — with tattoos, curly hair, brown skin — but they were doing things that we’ve been told belonged only to white people. Bull riding, Bronco riding, barrel racing, steer-wrestling. I knew about Black cowboys before this of course; if you’re Black, you know all about the Buffalo Soldiers, but this was something else. This was a rodeo for Black people by Black people. I developed a relationship with Bill Pickett, they’ve really taken me under their wing and taught me a lot. They even showed my film before one of their rodeos. Now I know cowboys all across the country, and not just Black ones. I met these two young cats from Argentina who do rodeos as a hobby, but as a day job they transport steer between North and South America in 747’s. I know a family of Black ranchers in Oklahoma who’ve been in shootouts with rustlers; the youngest one is like 11 years old. It’s definitely personal now. I’m still an outsider because I don’t live this life day to day, but I’ve made friends with the people who live this life and those relationships have been very rewarding. As far as the love side of the story, I think that’s something I’ve always explored in my work. There’s the love triangle in the film, but for me what the film is really about is the love between two brothers. I have a brother. Relationships amongst men can be really complicated, especially with Black men. There’s a lot of stuff we just don’t talk about. If men are expected to be tough, Black men are expected to be stone walls. While I’m not trying to make a commentary on toxic male masculinity, I am interested in how much can go unsaid before we can’t take anymore and find ourselves screaming at the top of our lungs. Maybe I get into more of this with the feature, but that’s a big driving force for me: what goes unsaid between Black men. Love and duty are big themes in your piece. How do these topics complement each other? Do you think one cannot exist without the other? You guys are asking all the tough questions. Hindsight is always 20/20; film is no exception. You learn so much about what you’re trying to say after the film is done. I’ve learned a lot about myself as a filmmaker and about what’s eating at me as a Black man from making this film. I’m not going to pretend to know exactly what love is. Sometimes it’s hard for me to distinguish love from lust. I do think that when we feel love for someone we also feel a sense of duty to that person. It’s like ‘It’s my duty to protect your heart,’ or ‘It’s my duty to defend your life with my life.’ I think love can suffocate us as well. Love can be unfair. Sometimes when we’re in love we can’t tell where we begin and the other person ends. This is especially true in romantic relationships, but what about with family? What about with the Black family? I can only speak for my family, but growing up, my mother made my brother and I responsible for each other in a way that was perhaps unrealistic. It extended even to career. If he got a directing job it was his responsibility to see how he could bring me along, if I got a job shooting a commercial I was supposed to see how I could get him on set. I love my brother and I’m sure he loved me, but at some point I had to ask myself: who am I outside of this social contract? Am I spreading my wings as much as I could knowing I’ve got this duty to another person? Maybe love is saying “you feel this sense of duty, but because I love you I relinquish you of that duty.’ I don’t know. To answer your second question, no. I don’t think there can be love without at least a sense of duty. What advice would you give aspiring filmmakers trying to break into the film industry? Film is collaborative; always empower your collaborators. If you’re directing, it’s your responsibility to create a space for them to do their best work. You never know where the best idea is going to come from. In A Rodeo Film the entire cross motif was thought up by my Production Designer, Jessica Cole. We were going to rodeos and researching colors and costumes and a unique thing that we always came across was jewelry. I’m a Black guy. When dudes wear chains I don’t even really see them anymore. It’s just a part of our culture, at least where I’m from. We call them Jesus Pieces. They still wear grillz and rock spinners on their cars where I’m from. Jessica, as an outsider, took notice of this and thought it would be a nice prop to support the narrative. Be open to all ideas. You don’t have to take them all, but be open and really willing to hear out your collaborators. You have them for a reason. The second thing comes from a great directing professor I had at AFI, Rob Spera: ‘The work is the reward.’ Notoriety is cool, I suppose, but for me, the coolest thing is being able to wake up and do this. We all have to support ourselves, so money is great of course, but what really gets me going is getting that next job or having that next opportunity to step on set as a director. I’ve worked with Peter and Bob Farrelly a bit; these guys just won an Oscar. How often do you think they talk about it? Never. I think Peter lets his friends take turns keeping the Oscar at their house. He just really loves having the opportunity to tell stories. He’s an amazing writer, he loves it when someone reads his scripts and responds to it in some sort of fashion. I think what’s gotten these guys this far is their love and respect for the craft and the honor and privilege to be able to do it. Now, more than ever, there’s space for creatives of diverse backgrounds to tell their stories. Let’s take advantage of it and create, then keep creating. Being able to work in this field is the reward. "

The festival will be hosted on ABFF.com from August 21–30, with more than 100,000 virtual attendees from around the globe anticipated to attend. As part of this year’s Short Film Competition, emerging writers and directors presented narratives that ranged from gut-wrenching tragedies to subversive comedies and a journey into self-exploration. Director Ethosheia Hylton is known for her vast array of work which has won numerous awards. Co-writer and producer Joan Iyiola (who plays Daisy in their ABFF finalist film) is a British-Nigerian actress and producer based in London. She is best known for playing the title role in The Duchess of Malfi at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Below, Hylton and Iyiola discuss the themes of Black women and self identity in their short film DỌLÁPỌ̀ IS FINE. How does it feel to be the winners of the 23rd Annual HBO Short Film Competition at ABFF? Iyiola: We are incredibly grateful for this award and proud of our entire team. Here’s to many more stories that celebrate and inspire young black women. Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition? Iyiola: We decided to submit our film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition because it was the festival that we were the most excited to participate in, based on its commitment to community and its celebration of Black artists. It is an honour to be a part of ABFF 2020. Hylton: I’ve been following the ABFF festival for many years and submitted films to the shorts competition in the past. I was unsuccessful but determined to be a part of the festival one day. It was always at the forefront of my mind whilst making this short that it should be submitted. What inspired you to write this story? Iyiola: A few years back, I had read a short story called “Sunita” on BBC Radio 3 written by co-writer Chibundu Onuzo. We met and became collaborators, and adapted the story for screen as we felt that this was a narrative that we had yet to see on screen, and we related to so many aspects of Dolapo’s story. We wanted to show a middle-class Black girl within a boarding school environment, and tell a celebratory story, sprinkled with some Black girl magic. Are any moments or themes in the film inspired by your own experiences? Iyiola: Yes, so many of them resonate! When Imogen goes to touch Dolapo’s hair? I’ve been there so many times that my reflexes are as fast as a superhero’s. Being the only Black person in a white space and the microaggressions that follow. Navigating intergenerational relationships. Wondering where my wig has really come from… Hylton: There are many aspects of Dolapo’s journey which remind me of my teens. Having a name that nobody could pronounce, loathing my hair and the embarrassment of having to sing in front of the entire school. I saw my tumultuous teens reflected in Dolapo’s world when I read the script and knew immediately that I wanted to direct it. How have Black women’s relationships with themselves (hair, body image, etc.) changed for the better? Iyiola: Ha! It is always changing! I remember when I first released my natural hair for a role, my mum constantly asked me how I was feeling and if the world was treating me differently. I knew in those conversations that we were moving through an evolution on Black women’s relationship to themselves. I stand on her shoulders, and her experiences guided me towards loving my Blackness and womanhood. One of our hopes for the film is that it encourages Black girls and women to walk with confidence. When we do, it is a powerful statement for the world to see. Hylton: The shift in black women’s relationship with themselves compared to the past is incredible. Now we can look on the TV and in the media and see ourselves represented in all forms. We aren’t ashamed to show our natural beauty and self-expression is evident in all forms. With better understanding of how insidious the past representations of black women on tv and in the media have shaped self deprecation, I feel black women are now freeing themselves from this and embracing their beauty in all forms. Do you believe self-expression can exist in the corporate world? Iyiola: Yes, but we are not there yet. We need more Black women in positions of power. In the film, Daisy has had to assimilate to get to where she is, and there is no one else that looks like her in her working environment. But, imagine if she was able to code switch with another colleague, or better yet, set the tone as a leader. Hylton: Yes I do, and I feel it is for the individual not to conform if they feel they are being stripped of their identity. We are all individual and unique and as long as you’re doing your job you should be free to express yourself free of judgment in any environment. What advice would you give aspiring filmmakers trying to break into the film industry? Iyiola: Start before you are ready, there is never a ‘right’ time to begin. Choose a story that you connect with deeply, and build a team of those that passionately share your vision. Celebrate the differences between you and make space for each filmmaker’s artistry to shine. Hylton: My advice would be to never give up. Preparation meets opportunity so always be prepared. Study your craft, make your films and submerge yourself into the word of film. Tell your story! This is a tough, cut throat industry and when you are starting out can seem completely unachievable. But tenacity and passion for your art will lead you to achieving your goals. "

As part of this year’s Short Film Competition, emerging writers and directors presented narratives that ranged from gut-wrenching tragedies to subversive comedies and a journey into self-exploration. Letia Solomon is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who is a champion for underrepresented voices and hopes to inspire the next generation of artists. Below, Letia explains how her personal experiences helped create The Cypher. Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition? ABFF and its long-standing HBO Competition have featured so many outstanding films in the past, It was always one of my top goals as a filmmaker to apply. The entire team is thrilled and we are honored for The Cypher to be featured in the 2020 HBO Competition! What inspired you to transition from your career as an engineer into filmmaking? It took about four years of soul searching and trial and error to figure it all out. The turning point was in 2015 when one of my previous films really resonated with this 14-year-old girl at a film festival. The film focused on a young Black teen competing in a robotics competition to gain scholarship money for college. She came up to me afterwards and said she saw herself in my character and plans to be the first person in her family to go to college. I often volunteered with the youth programs in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), but none of it moved me in the same way as hearing this young girl commit to her dreams after watching my film. She solidified my “why” and confirmed that my perspective on storytelling matters. I also realized that project management and problem solving fit perfectly well in filmmaking since we’re constantly solving problems. Whether it’s on set, story development, or in post-production, these critical thinking skills are transferable and will enhance the final project. Do you feel that your experiences working in a different industry prior to entertainment gives you a unique filmmaking perspective? How so? Absolutely! Working in Aerospace as an African American female engineer provided privileges and setbacks that were crucial in adapting to film. I gained access as being the only Black woman in the room but I also had to work twice as hard to be heard and gain the same amount of respect. The same thing occurred while studying Chemical Engineering in undergrad at a predominantly white institute, therefore the work ethic was cultivated well before film. I’ve also had wonderful women mentors that have experienced love, life, and loss while still showing up as incredible managers, executive leadership, and senior-level engineers. Working in a different industry taught me leadership, project management, patience and communication skills. The passion and drive for storytelling was always there, however film school provided the technical and creative tools to help bring these stories to life. What inspired you to direct this story? I was drawn to direct due to my love for hip-hop, the vivid landscape Wes created and my desire to champion this young man’s journey of self-acceptance. As an African American woman, I know what it feels like to be marginalized and felt that I had a strong perspective in showcasing our male counterparts. I also have friends and a dear family member that has gone through a similar experience and knew it was time to share this nuanced story on screen. How has being a member of the LGBTQIA+ hip-hop community changed over the last several years? Is there still the same stigma? The diverse representation of male and female emcees has definitely progressed over the years, however the change is slower for mainstream hip-hop. We can count with our fingers the numbers of mainstream queer rap artists that are widely popular with a large following. With respect to battle rap, the numbers get smaller due to the hyper-masculine or aggressive nature of the environment. Battle rap is a platform for real, raw lyricists to use anything they have to win. There’s a rich, complex history and relationship between the hip-hop and LGTBQIA+ communities that cannot be solved with just one film. However, we hope to encourage respectful discussions about this intersectionality and challenge the representations of hip hop artists moving forward. What is your favorite hip-hop album of all time? Why? It’s a tie between Outkast’s Aquemini and DMX’s And Then There Was X. These albums came out in the late 90s when I lived in the South and always brought back fond memories of my childhood. What advice would you give aspiring filmmakers trying to break into the film industry? My advice would be to keep practicing your craft as much as you can. If you want to be a writer, then write. If you want to direct, then pick up a camera and start making movies. No matter how rough your first drafts may be, it’s okay. Filmmaking is a process and it takes time to get it right. Also, more importantly: know why you’re making films. Your purpose will drive you forward and keep you going when things get tough. "

HBO has been a major sponsor of ABFF since its inception in 1997 and is dedicated to furthering ABFF’s mission to showcase quality film and television content by and about people of African descent. Each film in this category will compete for ABFF’s HBO Short Film Award and a prize of $10,000 for the winner and $5,000 for each of the finalists. Their short films will be available to stream on HBO Max on a later date. To highlight the accomplishments of these talented filmmakers, each day leading up to the festival we’ll feature one of the five finalists and their works. First up, Martina Lee is a director and filmmaker from Claymont, Delaware. In 2013, she spent a year in Singapore at New York University Tisch School of the Arts Asia. It was there she discovered her passion for directing. Below, Martina discusses her short film Black Boy Joy. Why did you decide to submit your film to ABFF’s HBO Short Film Competition? We submitted to the ABFF HBO Film Competition, because it is a really great opportunity for a film like ours to gain the most exposure it can. I was accepted last year as an Emerging Director for my film Blueberry. I knew when I made another short, I would apply again. This HBO Film Competition is a really great opportunity for our film to gain the most exposure. I am a huge fan of many of the filmmakers who were finalists in previous years, and it is such an honor to be included as part of that alumni. What inspired you to focus on the topic of autism and the stigma mental health has in the Black community? So often we see portrayals of mental health in the media through a white gaze. We felt it was important to tell this particular story to show not only that it happens in the Black community, but also how race makes those issues even more complicated. As a woman, what motivated you to explore this topic through male characters? Writer Michelle Sam wrote the story with three generations of Black men, because autism statistically happens more with men. Dealing with the stigma of mental health while dealing with the loss of a loved one presented a great conflict to talk about toxic masculinity. While we were showing how Selim’s autism makes him process things differently, we were watching a father and son figure out how to love each other through loss. I also was interested in exploring a more nuanced conversation about how to raise Black boys. How does having a child on the spectrum change that conversation? Tackling topics through Black fatherhood is not new for me. Blueberry, my previous film I wrote and directed, is about a Hotep podcast host searching for spiritual guidance while teaching his son how to be a man. I enjoy tackling topics through Black male characters because I get to explore the intersectionality of patriarchy and racism. How would you describe the portrayal of Black fathers and sons in modern filmmaking? The portrayal of Black fathers and sons in modern filmmaking mirrors society’s evolving conversations about race and patriarchy. There aren’t a ton of films that focus on Black fatherhood. In the past forty years, when we see Black families on screen a lot of times the father isn’t in the picture. The little time we do see Black men portrayed, they aren’t usually seen as mentors and providers. Characters like Furious Styles from Boyz n the Hood or John Quincy from John Q. represented Black male strength, personified in order to counteract the stigma of the absent father. (The same way the “strong Black woman” trope counters the mammy stereotype.) Although these were extremely positive representations, the characters themselves weren’t very complex. In these interesting times, as we challenge gender norms and toxic masculinity, we are seeing a slightly more nuanced portrayal of fatherhood and father figures. Mahershala Ali’s portrayal of Juan in Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight is a character full of contradictions. Barry shows us that human beings are complicated and regardless if their actions are helpful or harmful, it still just makes them human. Another example is Randall Pearson in This is Us; he is arguably the most popular Black TV dad today. Perfect to a fault, Randall is a fantastic father who struggles with anxiety. However, it is his relationship with his own father, William Hill, that illustrates vulnerability and sensitivity in father-son relationships that are rarely seen on television. In both of these examples, Black men are able to be more than one thing. The more Black people are able to tell their own stories, the more we will continue to see an ever-evolving spectrum of Black fatherhood. What advice would you give aspiring filmmakers trying to break into the film industry? 1. Your goal as an artist is to find and cultivate your voice, because it is the one thing that separates you from the rest of the pack. 2. Don’t compare yourself to other people. Work on your craft and don’t worry about what other people are doing. 3. Treat people with compassion and kindness because it’s the right thing to do as a human. Also, you will most likely end up seeing them again later. 4. Every time someone tells you NO, just think of it as one step closer to a YES. "

As a child, he didn’t even know if he wanted to stay in the city of Stockton where he was raised. The new HBO documentary Stockton on My Mind tells the story of Mayor Tubbs. Born to a teenage mother and an incarcerated father, Tubbs felt society destined him for either prison or death. Defying expectations, in 2016, he became one of the youngest mayors of a major American city at age 26, as well as Stockton’s first African American mayor. Since his rise to Mayor of Stockton, Tubbs has gained national attention for his progressive policies and innovative ideas including his universal basic income program (SEED), Stockton Scholars, and more. Stockton on my Mind follows Tubbs’ efforts to reverse the fortunes of a city known as one of the poorest, most violent and least literate in the nation. Below Mayor Tubbs discusses the new documentary, his revolutionary ideas for Stockton, and what he hopes everyone learns from Stockton, California. Growing up, my whole mentality was to love the city and then to get as far away from it as possible. Stockton, growing up, was a site of a lot of pain. My mom was always saying things like, “You have to leave to be successful.” I felt like being here was a dead end. It wasn’t until my cousin was murdered, and I spent time in college and reflected on all the good things I got from the city that I decided to run for office. Stockton provided me with the mentors, teachers, friends, family and cultural diversity that is at the core of who I am. But even then, while in college, I thought I would be involved in service and making change, but not in elected office… "
https://medium.com/warnermediaent/lovecraft-country-showrunner-misha-green-on-reclaiming-the-horror-genre-a0bd303c61ac?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"After reading Matt Ruff’s 2016 novel Lovecraft Country, Misha Green knew she had to adapt it for television. Utilizing the novel as a jumping off point, Green decided to use different storytelling styles to focus on Black characters that are often left out of the horror genre entirely. The upcoming HBO series of the same name follows Atticus Freeman, played by Jonathan Majors, as he journeys with his childhood friend Letitia (Jurnee Smollett) and his uncle George (Courtney B. Vance) on a road trip from Chicago across 1950s Jim Crow America in search of his missing father Montrose (Michael Kenneth Williams). Their search-and-rescue turns into a struggle to survive and overcome both the racist terrors of white America and monstrous creatures that could be ripped from an H.P. Lovecraft paperback. Below, Green chats with journalist Stacey Wilson Hunt about the process behind creating Lovecraft Country and how she utilizes different genres and themes to continually pull back layers of a story that is especially relevant today. When were you first acquainted with Matt Ruff’s 2016 novel on which Lovecraft Country is based? What inspired you to adapt it for television? Misha Green: I was working on season two of Underground and my agents at CAA said, ‘There’s this book you may want to adapt.” I was blown away. I thought, “I want to explore these characters and their journeys.” I was also really into the idea of reclaiming the genre space for those who’ve typically been left out of it. I said, “I’m ready to make this into an epic television show.” Ruff’s novel draws heavily from the work of famed science-fiction author H.P. Lovecraft, who passed away in 1937 at age 46. He was and remains controversial for both the racist themes in his writing and his own well-documented bigotry. To what degree did you have to become an expert in his canon as well? I’d read a bit of Lovecraft; his influence in horror-fan culture is huge. And you can definitely tell he was a racist from his work. It’s hard to miss those troubling themes. So when I was reading Matt’s book, I understood the Lovecraft references, but didn’t feel it was crucial to dive fully into that canon in order to write the series. What was your approach to adapting Ruff’s novel? How much freedom did you feel to reinvent and expand upon it? We essentially used the book as a beautiful jumping-off point. My strategy was to take all of its dope, cool stuff and write new dope, cool stuff. (Laughs) There was never a sense of “Let’s bank this for later.” When you have 10 people in a room, you’re always able to come up with new ideas. The goal was to deepen the characters and the stories. I told our writers, “Be prepared for therapy because we’re gonna excavate all of it in here.” At its core the show is a family drama. We had to dig into stuff that made us uncomfortable. We also had our lists of movies, novels and tropes that exemplified genre. How did we want to play off of those? The idea of creating a hybrid experience was exciting for everyone. And those inspirations are clear, with nods in the series to 1980s adventure movies like Goonies, contemporary blood-and-guts horror films, classic 1930s monster movies — all of which are incredibly familiar to audiences, yet we’ve never seen Black characters inhabit these narratives as robustly as they do here. Yes and what drew me to adapting the book for TV, as opposed to film, was the chance to do a Goonies-style episode, then sci-fi, then mystery, then a ghost story; go bananas and reclaim all of those storytelling styles for characters who’ve typically died at the beginning of those stories. One of the reasons I love horror so much is — when it’s done well — you can keep peeling away the layers and see something new every time. Jordan Peele, who serves as an executive producer on Lovecraft Country, has similarly reinvented horror as a space for telling layered, socially-conscious stories. How did you first meet? “My agents said, “We think you would get along really well.” And I was like, “Why? I don’t like to laugh.” (Laughs) “No, no, he’s a huge horror fan and he’s working on a movie right now.” And we vibed right away. Then Jordan said, “I want you to watch Get Out.” I saw it and went, “Phew!” We’d gotten along so well that I didn’t want to watch it and be like, “Oh, man.” But it was amazing. Then when we were working on Lovecraft — he was doing the film Us at the time — we talked a lot about our shared belief regarding horror, which is: You need the metaphor. I’d played with that on Underground; that it was a heist movie, but set in slavery times. That the people pursuing the heist happened to be enslaved people trying to steal back their most precious possession: their lives. I used the heist genre to appeal to people who thought, “Ugh, I don’t want to watch a slavery show.” But you did want to watch this one because we used genre as a doorway into something deeper. Speaking of Underground, making Lovecraft has reunited you with actress Jurnee Smollett. What made her the perfect choice to play Letitia Lewis? I generally don’t think of prospective actors when I write. But Jurnee kept asking, “So, how’s that script going? I was like, “Good!” When I was done I asked, “Do you want to read it?” She said, “What can I say? It’s f — -ing amazing. So when are you gonna say you want me to be in this?”(Laughs) We’re very close friends, but also have a beautiful artistic partnership based on energy, commitment and a shared desire to go deeper and challenge ourselves. She brings truth to every role and is so ferocious. But a lot of what we talked about on Underground we continued in Lovecraft Country. What’s the vulnerability underneath this woman’s strength? Let’s see both sides of her. Arguably the heart and soul of the series is Atticus Freeman played by actor Jonathan Majors. What inspired you to cast him? When we were casting, [pilot director] Yann Demange said “There’s this amazing cat Jonathan who was in my movie White Boy Rick.” He walked into the room and I was like, “Oh my God, you’re Atticus. I believe you’re the soldier, the geeky kid, the black nerd.” Halfway through shooting Lovecraft, I saw Jonathan’s film [a24’s] The Last Black Man in San Francisco. I told him on-set “Holy f — — dude!” There wasn’t an inch of Atticus in the character of Monty. He was like, “That’s the biggest compliment you could give me.” He was a revelation the entire time we were shooting. I was like, “How have you not been in everything?” Lovecraft is the most visual-effects heavy project you’ve undertaken as a show creator. How did you approach those elements of storytelling during the writing process and what most excited you when it came to executing them during production? We worked with KNB, an incredible special effects and makeup house. Knowing I’d have their tools to tell the story made it feel like an amazing playground. Initially I just wrote down my ideas like, “Ok, what craziness is in my head?” Then we’d talk. For example, there’s an amazing exorcism scene. The effects team asked me, “What is each of these ghosts?” I was like, “Well, there should be one that has a baby head.” (Laughs) So the artists designed 10 different baby heads. “Ok, I like that baby head mixed with that baby head.” Then we get to set. “Okay, here are seven different levels the wall-shakes effects are set to.” I think, “I get seven levels of wall shakes to choose from?” Then the actors come in. Jurnee exorcises her full self while getting a ghost out of her. I’m like, “I need nothing else in this scene but that!” Then the ghosts come in with all of their special-effects makeup. “Wow, this looks really scary. I need nothing else but that!” But that was just principal photography. Then we have the second unit, which shot all the stunts and pickups. Then the effects are added and we turn the actors into 20 different ghosts. To be working with people who are at the top of their crafts game…I was a kid in a candy store. Much like Underground, Lovecraft is as much an auditory experience as a visual one as the soundtrack boasts a genre-busting mix of 1950s-era music, contemporary hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and other works by Black artists. Did you write with specific audio cues in mind, discover them during production or make those choices in post? A bit of all three. [Underground co-creator] Joe Pokaski and I used to talk about: How do we pull the slavery portrait off the museum wall and evolve the story beyond, “Look at how bad slavery was?” One way was by using more vibrant camera movements; the other was through using modern music. I wanted to build on that in Lovecraft and also integrate “found audio” into the score. For example, in the opening we use voiceover from the [1950 film] The Jackie Robinson Story. Later we have [Ntozake Shange’s 1975 poem] For Colored Girls and [poet Gil Scott-Heron’s] Whitey on the Moon. I love the idea of taking our show “out of time.” It’s the past, present and future. How do we wrap all of that into a unique soundscape? We want the show to be full-sensory, engaging and have people learn from it without having to learn from it. My favorite learning experiences are immersive; those that make me re-think what I know as opposed to “Here’s some bad history.” How can we immerse the viewer even further? I love when I have revelations two weeks after the fact where I’m like, “Oh wow, ok.” Lovecraft Country feels particular resonant as Hollywood — and our country at large — face ongoing, painful reckonings about race. How does it feel to be sharing a show like this at a time when boundary-pushing narratives centered on Black Americans have arguably never been more important? If your art is speaking to the moment, that’s all you can hope for. It’s exciting to know that people will be engaging in the show during this time, especially on the platform that HBO has given it. And in many ways, Lovecraft is the continuation of the same themes and questions we explored in Underground: What are we willing to do for our freedom? And what does freedom actually mean? I’m honored that our show can be part of that very important conversation. Lovecraft Country premieres August 16 at 9PM on HBO. "

Fleischmann’s parents pinpoint dressing as Steven Spielberg with a face paint beard, baseball hat, and giant video camera slung over her shoulder for her third grade book project as the moment she knew she wanted to be a producer. After studying Film and Television at Boston University, Fleischmann spent a summer in Cape Cod working at a candy store and working on a small indie movie before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time career in entertainment. Flash forward eight years: 30-year-old Fleischmann is getting ready for the fourth and final season of Room 104, which kicked off July 24. Below, Fleischmann shares her Hollywood journey and how she managed to become an Executive Producer on an HBO series at a young age. When I moved out to L.A., my first job was as an assistant at a talent management company. It was a great experience and all the people were awesome, but I realized pretty quickly that management wasn’t the right fit for me. I took this wild, wild risk where I said to them, “I want to work in production. Do you know anybody?” I don’t consider myself a really ballsy person, but as a 20-something-year-old, I feel like it was a really ballsy thing to say, “This isn’t right for me.” I thought I was going to offend them, but I felt like I needed to do it, and they were so gracious and willing to help put me on my right path. I should give my younger self more credit! They said, “Well, who do you like?” I said, “I love the Duplass Brothers. I think the stuff they’re doing is really cool.” They knew the Duplass Brothers and Mark happened to be looking for an assistant right at that moment. So they reached out on my behalf and Mark and I met up for a cup of coffee. I don’t think he would ever call it an interview, it was more of a casual hang. I vividly remember him taking out his laptop and showing me a massive spreadsheet of all of the projects and ideas they had floating around. Even in that first meeting, Mark talked about wanting an assistant who he could mentor and teach how to produce and budget for the smaller movies they were doing. I worked on Togetherness as Mark’s assistant while also producing a couple of projects during that time. Being his assistant was a very eye-opening experience — it wasn’t just about grabbing coffee. I quickly learned that being an assistant in television is essentially working as a producer for your boss. I learned so much about balancing tasks, time management, all sorts of logistics, and how to create and nurture relationships. Because that’s all any of this is: how you communicate with other people. I remember sitting at my desk in the Togetherness post production office one afternoon when Mark came up to me and asked, “Do you want to produce this TV show?” It was Room 104, an idea he and Jay had been discussing for years, but had never found the right time to dive into. It finally seemed like the right time, and apparently Mark felt I was ready to take on a bigger producing role. It felt like a massive leap to go from being an assistant to being a producer, but at the same time, I felt like the work I had already been doing for Mark had prepared me for it. Mark and Jay practice the “available material” school of filmmaking. For The Puffy Chair, they had a van because Mark was in a band. They had these two identical armchairs. And they created a story around what they had available to them. Working within those confines, anything can happen, anything goes. The idea was to apply those same principles to Room 104, treating each episode as a short film set entirely in one motel room. This allowed us to bring in new people for each episode that we’d been wanting to work with as guest stars, writers, and directors. It was a concept that could have been so limiting, but was actually incredibly freeing. Producing Room 104 has given me an opportunity to play with different genres and develop stories in different ways, because we don’t want any two episodes to feel the same. In order to do that, we have to be constantly pushing our boundaries. We have to bring new people in and encourage them to push their boundaries. I have learned so much from the spirit of experimentation this created on set, especially on the development side. Creating these standalone stories taught me invaluable lessons about how to tell stories. As I grew and evolved as a person, my role did too. While I started out as a creative producer, I was also managing a lot of the logistical production in the early days of the show. Over the course of the series, my creative responsibilities have continued to grow, and I see myself more as a creative producer and partner to the writers and directors in a way I didn’t fully understand I could be in the beginning. That’s been a really big lesson for me: to learn how to support the other creative people, how to support the crew and how to create an environment where creativity flourishes. I also learned how to delegate tasks in a way that wasn’t possible as an assistant. So much of the job of an assistant is just doing whatever needs to be done, whatever it is. It took me at least a season on Room 104 to realize that I could simultaneously free up my own bandwidth to focus on the creative and give someone else the chance to be involved and hone their production skills. Between seasons 1 and 2, I really transitioned from being in the office a lot of the time to being at video village with directors most of the time. Trying on different things taught me how to be the best creative producer. From my experience and from what I’ve seen, it’s a unique show in that it has a showrunner, but also kind of doesn’t. Mark and I really share a lot of that, the creative center of the show. Showrunning is managing the different stories and making sure that it all feels cohesive and, because they’re all so different, how do we find that balance? In the role that I have played, I’ve gotten to be that showrunner, but also be the creative producer trying to solve those creative and logistical problems. Being on set all day every day, instead of being in a writers’ room where a lot of showrunners end up being, I got to be the eyes on the ground for the whole process and I feel so fortunate to have that experience, to be in the thick of it the whole time. I started working on the show when I was so young. I know I’m still young now and I still have a lot of room to grow. But in the beginning, everything was so new and, as I’ve evolved, I’ve been able to see the show in a different light. It’s been my entire world for the last four years. It’s just so connected to how I’ve grown as a person, how I’ve changed, the new things I’ve learned and the new people I’ve met. Seeing that parallel is very special for me. For so long I let my youth be such a big part of my identity and I felt simultaneously self-conscious and proud of being a young producer. I think I’m now reaching a point where my age does not dictate who I am and what I’m capable of, and working on the show has definitely taught me that. People say age is just a number and it sounds so cliche. But it really does feel like anything can happen at any age. "

The client is then provided social assistance including job training, drug treatment, and counseling after securing housing. Although social media users had mixed opinions on the idea, many thought it was “abhorrent.” VoteVets, an advocacy organization for veterans, stated on Twitter that rather than continuing the process of aiding homeless veterans, Trump wants to find them and toss them into what can best be described as internment camps. But several applauded Trump’s suggestion. Brigitte Gabriel, a conservative author and anti-Islam activist, claimed that Joe Biden wants to address Ukraine’s homelessness issue. Donald Trump wants to address the issue of homelessness in the country. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), there has been a concerted campaign across the nation to make homelessness illegal. Nearly 600,000 Americans experienced homelessness last year. According to the NAEH, several states have already passed legislation along similar lines, including Texas, Tennessee, and Missouri. The Washington Post stated at the time that Trump pushed for White House officials to get homeless people off the streets and into government-backed facilities in California, the state with the largest population of homeless people. Trump demanded their removal from Los Angeles and other cities in the state in 2019, according to The Washington Post. The same year, Trump made fun of the Maryland congressional district of then-Representative Elijah Cummings, claiming it was overrun with homeless people and that Baltimore was “disgusting” and “rodent infested.” In response, Trump detractors posted images of neighborhoods in Republican-controlled areas that also showed homelessness, poverty, and trash. Trump’s most recent proposal, unveiled as he runs for the Republican presidential nomination, is unlawful and would discourage people from getting help when they really need it, Uptown People’s Law Centre executive director Alan Mills told Newsweek in a phone interview on Tuesday. The previous president’s activities, according to Mills, left him horrified but unsurprised given his lengthy history of anti-homeless objectives. … EDITORIAL NOTE: The original source of this post is the recent video posted by @realDonaldTrump on Truth Social.

On Thursday, following the conclusion of his final yearly physical examination, US President Joe Biden’s physician deemed him “fit for duty.” The president, who will age 82 in 2024, is anticipated to seek re-election. The oldest-ever US president Biden is not experiencing any major physical or neurological health difficulties, according to the much-expected report following the thorough examination, which did note a few minor health issues. “President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those of as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” said Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, in a letter published by the White House. Two health conditions that were noted at the previous checkup, which was conducted in November 2021, mostly persist. “President Biden experiences occasional symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, primarily having to clear his throat more often. This may also contribute to occasional cough and sinus congestion. His symptoms are typically exacerbated shortly after meals”. as per the letter published. He underwent an aggressive workup which was detailed in the November 2021 health summary. The original assessment by the President’s physician that gastroesophageal reflux is the source of the President’s throat clearing and coughing was supported by the findings and by expert consultation. Mild Sensory Peripheral Neuropathy of feet which is cause of Biden’s stiff walking because of “wear and tear” in his spine. A finding of mild peripheral neuropathy is noted as above. His symptoms have not progressed, and his exam is actually a bit improved, in that the area of subtle heat/cold sensation deficit seems less pronounced and has decreased in size. The most common cause of peripheral neuropathy is diabetes. The President does not have diabetes (Hemoglobin A1C and fasting blood glucose are both normal). The President does not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol, and he continues to work out at least five days per week.

Any object presents a threat to the safety and security of American people, I will take it down” President Biden said in response to whether it was worth taking a $12 Balloon down costing millions of dollars. He also confirmed that there is nothing that suggests these balloons belong to the Chinese spy balloon program. The Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade (NIBBB) reported that they lost contact with one of its balloons namely ‘K9YO’ around the same location and at the same time a U.S. Air Force F-22 jet downed an unidentified object using a Sidewinder missile. The balloon used for K9YO was a $13.33, silver 32-inch mylar balloon sometimes used by hobbyists for high-altitude flights. While F-22 Raptor, which has been described as “the best air dominance fighter in the world,” is estimated to be around $200 million. The missile used to shoot down the object was a Sidewinder missile worth approx $400,000. A few hours prior to a fighter jet shooting down an unidentified object above Canada, the hobby balloon (a weather balloon carrying its location transmitter) was last seen over Alaska. According to a forecasted route map, the balloon was traveling in the direction of the crash site of the UFO and might have been shot down. Related: One More UFO Shoot Down By US The Biden administration was on edge following the discovery of other items floating above the United States after a Chinese surveillance balloon coasted across the continent. Biden has responded to the Canadian PM for help to shoot down a UFO. Fighter jets from both Canada and US were scrambled. An F-22 of US Air Force successfully took it down.

In the ongoing AI war between Google and Microsoft, Google’s parent company Alphabet lost $100 billion after its much-awaited launch of chatbot Bard. Alphabet stock declined by More than 7% on Wednesday’s trading session and closed at around $100. The reason for this big dip was an official tweet from Google. The tech giant posted a short GIF video of Bard showing its capabilities which Google termed as a “launchpad for curiosity”. When the chatbot was asked, “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old about?”. In its response, Bard wrote, “JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system or exoplanets”. Which experts believed to be inaccurate because records from NASA show it was done by VLT in 2004. Google’s this event came one day after Microsoft confirmed that AI chatbot ChatGPT will be integrated into Bing. OpenAI introduced chatbot ChatGPT in Nov 22 which can generate human-like text of queries asked. It received a positive response worldwide. Soon after its launch, Microsoft showed interest in it and signed a deal to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. It was seen as an early lead by Microsoft over Google. As a result of this, Google was seen as left out and people started expecting Google to introduce something of a similar sort. To counter the rival’s move, Google’s first step has already cost $100 billion to the company. Bard was to be released for public use in the upcoming weeks as written by Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.

In the most recent update, the suspected Chinese spy drone was shot down after clearance from President Joe Biden. It was allowed to float over USA’s airspace for several hours to avoid debris causing damage to the people. The incident of the Chinese balloon hovering over sensitive nuclear sites in the USA has created fresh chaos between two rival nations. Earlier, the balloon was seen from the naked eye over Carolinas and it was expected to exit USA’s airspace within a few days. China’s foreign minister has confirmed the ownership of the balloon claiming it to be a privately owned balloon for weather monitoring and it is not a spy balloon. In its response, China said the balloon, though maneuverable, could not hold its trajectory and got displaced by strong jet streams. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed his trip of 5–6th Feb to China in response to the flying of this suspected Chinese spy balloon. The visit was the first high-level meeting between these countries in the last three years and various sensitive issues such as of Taiwan and Covid were supposed to be discussed in the meeting. Recent data on unemployment has left people surprised giving 2023 a much-awaited positive start. Despite large layoffs from various tech giants, the US has recorded a surge in the number of jobs adding 517000 jobs in January, a blockbuster number, which is way beyond than expected number of 185,000. The leisure hospitality sector has seen a sudden boost in jobs adding 128,000 jobs but still, the number is below pre-pandemic levels. Other major contributors are government jobs adding 74,000, factory jobs adding 19,000, and private sector jobs adding 443000. The current unemployment rate of 3.4% makes it the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. The news came amid Federal Bank continuing to raise the interest rate. Though you find the temperature 4 degrees Saturday morning in New York City, But wind chills from the Arctic blast are making it as low as -15 and even down to -30 far north and west.

Do you know what angry halfwits do in other countries? They throw potatoes.”― Oliver Markus Malloy, Inside The Mind of an Introvert. A sequence of shooting all around the USA has resulted in the death of more than 70 people till Jan 25. It imposes a great risk to the common people of such a powerful country. Young entrepreneurs worldwide see the USA as a land of opportunity that can give wings to their bright ideas. But such frequent incidents of shootings create confusion in their mind as well. What is the root cause of such incidents and why such incidents are on the raise? Is it because of racism, movies showing urban gang violence, relaxed law, and order, or the mental health of the people? Well, it is not the first time. Figures of the last year are scary too. The country experienced 648 mass shootings and 44,000 gun-related deaths last year, illustrating the severity of the issue with guns, according to the Gun Violence Archive website. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks gun violence using police reports, news coverage, and other public sources, has recorded a total of 40 cases of confirmed shooting this year so far which has resulted in the death of 70 people. The latest in the list is a mass shooting at Half Moon Bay where the shooter, 67, killed 7 people at two different locations in a suspected targeted attack. Just a few days back shooter fired indiscriminately at the people celebrating the Lunar New Year festival and later shot himself. Now the Police are trying to figure out the cause but non of the victims were known to the shooter. In both cases, the accused were in possession of automatic to semi-automatic arms. Guns are deeply ingrained in American society and the nation’s political debates. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives Americans the right to bear arms, and about a third of U.S. adults say they personally own a gun. At the same time, President Joe Biden and other policymakers earlier this year proposed new restrictions on firearm access in an effort to address gun violence ranging from rising murder rates in some major cities to mass shootings. More Guns, More Deaths. There are about 393 million privately owned firearms in the US, according to an estimate by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. That’s 120 guns for every 100. While the exact number of civilian-owned firearms is difficult to calculate due to a variety of factors but no other nation worldwide stands close to this figure. And still, many times accused are found in possession of unauthorized weapons. If you guys want to appreciate my efforts and time involved in writing this story, Buy me a coffee!

As a psychotherapist and someone who identifies as a wounded healer, I feel so honored to witness others’ stories, especially on social media. Even just a few years ago, some people wouldn’t dare share their stories on the internet for anyone to view. And now, people come together from all over the world to share and provide education on mental health issues. Shared stories make the world a better place. Speaking our experiences and hearing the experiences of others helps us connect with others in a meaningful way. It helps us to know that suffering is part of the human condition; we all suffer. Knowing we have the backing and support of an entire community helps us bear challenges. It has been a true joy to see the stigma around mental health challenges slowly dismantled. But this past week I experienced a rude awakening that jarred me to my core. It showed me we still have a very long way to go. I am a very active member of the medical and therapy community on several social media platforms. I follow other medical and therapy providers, mental health advocates, and people who just want to learn more about mental health. A psychologist posted about how physicians (Medical Doctors; MDs) should not be diagnosing personality disorders. Personality disorders are defined by the American Psychiatric Association as “long-term patterns of behavior and inner experiences that differ significantly from what is expected.” Personality disorders are mental health diagnoses that require specialized training (perhaps above and beyond other disorders) and a good foundational knowledge of the person over time. Personality disorders… "

Diagnosed with BPD? Then you need to enter DBT treatment. I was one of those individuals for whom DBT was the first-line treatment when I was diagnosed with BPD in 1990, following my second suicide attempt. According to the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder (NEABPD), “BPD can be defined as a serious mental illness that centers on the inability to manage emotions effectively. The disorder occurs in the context of relationships: sometimes all relationships are affected, sometimes only one.” The NEABDP states that “BPD usually begins during adolescence or early adulthood.” However, three decades ago, I was not diagnosed until I was twenty-nine years old. At the time I was diagnosed, Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., a psychologist from The University of Washington had developed a new treatment designed to treat patients who had high rates of suicide attempts. The innovative treatment, known as dialectical behavior therapy or DBT contained elements of Zen and consisted of four modules: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation and Distress Tolerance. The definitive manual, “Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder,” was published in 1993. I was fortunate in that I received my diagnosis prior to the onset of managed care and the era of insurance companies' tendency to dictate treatment. Following a brief acute inpatient stay in New York City, I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in a northern suburb of Manhattan. The hospital had a long-term unit dedicated to treating individuals diagnosed with BPD, specializing in DBT. Even with the intense stigma attached to BPD in the 1990s, the staff on the long-term unit had chosen to work with us, from the psychiatrists to the nurses to the social workers. The eighteen patients (all women) on the unit formed a cohesive… "

Quality relationships make us happier, healthier, and more productive. Social support buffers stress and fulfills an important psychological need to belong and feel accepted by others. In an ideal, harmonious world, we would all enjoy plenty of health-protecting relationships, but that is not the reality for many. A startling number of people struggle with loneliness. As recently as 2020, a survey of 10,400 adults living in the United States found that 61% reported feeling lonely, a 7% increase from the previous year. With the ongoing pandemic, I expect those numbers to be even higher this year. Loneliness and its subsequent effects have become a significant societal concern that impacts health across the lifespan. Until recently, I was the only behavioral health provider in a small primary care clinic. Starting in March 2020, when the world shut down, my caseload skyrocketed. Every therapy appointment was quickly booked, and I struggled to keep up with the burgeoning demand. A large portion of my client population were individuals who lived alone and were suddenly completely isolated. Like all of us, they were no longer able to go to the gym, grocery store, or movie theater. Worse yet, they were by themselves at home too. This profound loss of connection ignited depressive symptoms in many people. The realization that they would remain isolated for an unknown amount of time was emotionally crushing. It wasn’t just people living alone who were suffering. My patients who lived with others, but had a difficult or disconnected relationship, also struggled. Even in a room full of people, we can feel lonely. When we lack meaningful connections with others, we feel isolated and this can trigger a deep, penetrating loneliness. Loneliness is a significant health threat. It increases both the risk for depression and the severity of depressive symptoms. Loneliness leads to emotional pain that impacts all age groups… "

Gratitude is a heavy hitter in one’s well-being, health and relationships. It is especially salient this week which mandates that we focus on those things for which we are thankful, and share those declarations over long, groaning tables of food. In my childhood and young adulthood, my list of “gratitudes” lined up like planes on a runway. I had to make economic decisions about which ones I would share with fellow diners. The early ones were acquisitive. Stuff I’d wanted and got, through no effort of my own. Barbie’s Dream House, the Cinderella watch in a plastic slipper, a birthday gift from my father that remains one of my most treasured possessions. My parents, concerned with my materialistic bent, would cut in, “How about your new baby sister?” Before I’d learned how to lie for the greater good, I answered simply, “No.” As I became a player in the world, my thankfulness focused on the positive results of my goals and efforts. I was good at a lot of things. I was very smart. I got accepted into exclusive training as a psychologist. I persevered. I did well. So well that I considered myself ready for marriage at age (gasp) 21. In the midst of graduate school, I decided I was ready for motherhood at 24 (double gasp). My daughter was a treasure. The bounty of my gratitude was basically a list of accomplishments. When it came right down to it, I was grateful to myself. Entitlement shadowed thankfulness. Yes, I was grateful for my many blessings, but I assumed that they were basically part of the plan for my life. For a budding clinical psychologist, I gave surprisingly little reflection on the whys and hows of it all. And I definitely neglected to consider that these things didn’t come with a lifetime guarantee. And then the bottom caved in. I fell far. And then I crashed. My “resume of gratitude” mocked me as I lost more and more parts of myself that piloted my life and my relationships. The perseverance I had once prized was worthless.

If you’ve ever struggled to make friends, join us as we explore the reasons behind these challenges. I began sharing my experiences with adult ADHD last month with the first article of the series, “ADHD Diary: The Mischief Maker.” The last piece has also examined this neurodevelopmental disorder from the perspective of someone with ADHD, discussing its impact on adult life and the symptoms we live with. Starting to research the topic inevitably leads to the question of why this is considered a “difference.” What makes us unique? Why does our brain work differently? Let’s try to understand what happens in an ADHD brain, combining scientific research with my own experiences. An article published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology in 2002 explains the differences in the brains of people with ADHD as follows: Connectivity Differences: ADHD brains show significant differences in neurotransmitter levels. Key chemical messengers, particularly norepinephrine and dopamine, are found at different levels in ADHD brains. These neurotransmitters affect many fundamental brain functions, such as attention, motivation, and emotional responses. Brain Region Differences: In ADHD brains, there are structural differences in areas like the frontal cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia. The frontal cortex regulates behavior, emotions, and attention, the limbic system influences emotions and motivation, and the basal ganglia… "

Remembering how I memorized every single dog breed in elementary school or my adolescent love for the trampoline, I looked to my parents, my primary care physician, to all the adults in my life and questioned how autism could have possibly been overlooked. The short answer is this: I was a girl born in rural Michigan in 1998. My Deafness, only diagnosed at age five, was barely acknowledged, let alone the possibility of a non-typical neurotype. While I cannot go back and change the past, I can present my findings in the hopes that they spark some recognition in yourself or your loved ones. Too many people of color, girls, and femmes, and people with other disabilities fall through the cracks of our medical system. This is my story of being one of them. When I was three years old, I still hadn’t said my first word. From the vague details my parents shared with me, this was when the first intervention happened. I was sent to a preschool program for toddlers with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the cassette tapes from this time period, I can see other autistic children I would later attend mainstream school with. The documents I was able to get a hold of include concerned writings from the teachers: “Annika does not socialize with the other children.” My lack of response to sound was also expressed. Sometime after this, my hearing loss was finally detected, and with that, any other pathology was subsequently dismissed. I was the first child, so my parents could easily write off my early autistic traits as me being “shy” and a “picky eater.” Fitted with hearing aids just a few months shy of kindergarten, I was noticeably behind. Suddenly thrust into a world of unintelligible sounds, I struggled. Twice a week, I was pulled out of class for speech therapy sessions. As soon as I could speak with only a mild Deaf accent, I was thrown to the wolves of elementary school social life. When I couldn’t make friends with my peers, I constructed snowmen solo or talked… "

I promise I do not mean this to sound condescending, but those who have never experienced clinical depression do not know what it is like. They cannot. I, for instance, cannot know how somebody confined to a wheelchair and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to war feels like. I can guess, I can sympathize. But I cannot empathize. I cannot understand. Which is why most readers will probably dismiss the opening sentence of this article as a sensationalist claim, a cool way to start an essay. But believe me, I truly, genuinely thought I would die by 2019. I still have that fear, that one day I will wake up and realize I do not want to live anymore. But I am no longer in the thick of clinical depression. Finally, finally I am at a place where I can honestly claim to be without depression. Looking back, I realize it must have taken a superhuman effort for me to keep living. What many misunderstand about depression is they think those who are depressed feel sad for a short period of the day. But clinical depression is every second of every day, without reprieve, without breaks, all the time. It affects and compromises every aspect of one’s life. I have lost count of the fifteen-minute panic attacks, the breakdowns, the crying, the outbursts, the self-harm, the self-loathing. When I look at the scars on my body now I feel baffled I would do that to myself. But back then it felt like the only way to cope. If I felt a panic attack incoming, or if I could not stop crying, I would cut myself. The pain would ground me. I did some wild things back in the day. I once walked the streets with the express intention of getting hit by a car, and almost did; I hurt my best friends on purpose so they would leave, which I thought they eventually would anyway; I ran away from home and almost shoplifted.

https://medium.com/invisible-illness/could-going-keto-help-your-mental-health-5b0fe0d58c32?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"Originally created in 1921 to help epilepsy treatment in children, the ketogenic diet has its origins in helping improve neurological health. Since its invention, scientists have found it helpful for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and many other neurological conditions. Since then, it has also become a fad diet among many health and wellness influencers. Touted for its ability to suppress hunger and stabilize blood sugar, the ketogenic diet is one that is rising in popularity among many fitness enthusiasts and dieters. There is growing research to show that the ketogenic diet is also beneficial for brain health and stabilizing neurotransmitters in the body helping to regulate mood and improve symptoms for many psychiatric patients. In case you have been hiding for the last decade, the ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein but gains the majority of its nutrition from fats like avocados and coconut oil. The goal of a ketogenic diet is to be in a state of “ketosis.” In other words, your body is no longer using glucose for its fuel, but ketones instead. That means that your blood glucose levels stay very low on average around 60 to 85 mg/dl. That usually means that carbohydrates and proteins are kept relatively low. Some people find the diet too restrictive and that is a deterrent for them in using this diet as a treatment plan. Some people have tried to use the dietary ketone supplements to shortcut actually maintaining a restrictive diet, but the higher carbs and proteins can interfere with the benefits. In 2021, a meta-analysis of brain disorders and the ketogenic diet was created. They were able to compare the results from 14 different observational studies about using a ketogenic diet for different mental and neurological conditions. Due to the small number of studies and the small number of participants in each study, the results were not definitive. There was, however, a positive association for the participants who were able to stay on the diet long-term. As stated above, many participants gave up the diet early on due to the restrictive nature of the plan. One of the reasons that the ketogenic diet may be helpful is the increase in GABA and glutamate production in the body. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that helps increase mood. Glutamate turns into GABA in the body. Some research has shown that the ketogenic diet can balance glutamate and GABA, helping to calm down the brain. This can be helpful for many brain-related issues. Disorders like anxiety, epilepsy, and Parkinson's, for example, all struggle with over-excitability of the brain. Another reason keto can help with mood disorders and neurological conditions is due to the blood sugar balancing. Someone who has insulin resistance has double the odds of developing major depressive disorder than an individual who does not have insulin resistance. Blood sugar dysregulation has a profound effect on the brain. A third reason has to do with mitochondrial function. In case you don’t remember from high school biology, the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Sugar consumption has a negative effect on mitochondria. Consuming sugar may decrease the effectiveness of the mitochondria. The brain requires a lot of energy to function properly, if you have ever had a mentally draining day, you may find you are hungrier at the end than if you had been physically active. That is because the brain needs so much energy. If the mitochondria are disabled, then it would mean higher levels of brain fog as well as decreasing other functions. This is a highly restrictive diet. There are people who should not attempt this method of treatment. People who struggle with disordered eating did not seem to show much improvement on the ketogenic diet alone and adding more restrictions to the diet may be triggering to individuals who struggle with already restricted eating. Individuals who struggle with fat consumption, including but not limited to those who have gallbladder concerns or have their gallbladder removed may struggle with this diet. As with any new diet change, it would be important to talk with your primary care doctor before beginning a diet like the ketogenic diet. Many videos and articles are out there discussing the ketogenic diet. Back when I was into Facebook groups, years ago, I found groups called “lazy keto” and the like. These groups and videos encourage individuals to eat imitation sugar-laden foods, high amounts of saturated fats in bacon and butter and mayonnaise, and low levels of phytochemical-rich fruits and vegetables. It is important to maintain a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for support in the gut as well as for antioxidant help with eliminating free radicals in the body. If you are going to try a ketogenic diet, make sure that you get the majority of the carbs that you are consuming from fiber-rich fruits and vegetables in order to achieve the best health benefits. This site has a list of ketogenic-friendly fruits and vegetables. There are many low-carb plant foods full of phytonutrients that are great for a ketogenic diet. If you are the kind of person who needs a premade meal plan, this site has a beginner-friendly plan for starting the ketogenic diet. "

It wasn’t a tummy ache; I hadn’t picked up one of the innumerable bugs that seem to infest preschools (or anywhere that a group of tiny humans congregate). The bright morning light slanting through my window made my stomach lurch and heave. I still remember it — white hot and slicing right to the back of my skull. I have no idea how my mother managed it. It must have been terrifying for her to have no idea what was wrong with her child. No apparent cause, no fever or obvious illness, and no way to help. I learned early on that any movement was disastrous. I would squirm around until I could find that one cool spot on the pillow, my face pressed into it to block the light, and then lie still and unmoving like a corpse as long as I could. Any twitch or shifting would make my stomach roil. Light was the other enemy. Even in a dark room, with a pillow or cool cloth covering my eyes, I could see little flashes like sparks and even make out the slightly reddish haze inside my eyelids. I know many people who suffer from migraines today, but growing up, it wasn’t the case. I’m sure I’m not the only one to have gotten them so young. There are several studies today focusing on children with migraines, but back then, in the late 70’s, migraines were barely recognized as a thing. My doctors didn’t believe me. I was sent to a shrink when I was 8 (who was happy to chat with me but didn’t feel I was ready for therapy quite yet). As I grew older, I was often accused of drug seeking — which, to a certain extent, was true. I would have given a limb or two for something that would get rid of the pain, something traditional pain meds like ibuprofen or even morphine could not touch. In the days before triptans, all I could do was curl up in the dark and try to separate myself from the pain. Chronic, invisible illness carries with it additional burdens for the sufferer. Not only do you have to suffer through the physical pain, which is exhausting and seemingly never-ending, but you have the extra weight of disbelief that follows you around. "

You get to be part of the flock, but not quite belong to it. Coming home with a perfect, aesthetically pleasing grade list in high school was one way I’d collect rare scraps of positive affirmations in the form of a brief glance and sarcastic utterance sounding like, “How good, well done.” But we moved around a lot.

From a murder point of view, Indonesia is one of the safest countries in the world with a rate 10X less than the U.S. So why do people hold this perception? Their lens is dirty. I was recently in Penang, Malaysia, when Hamas attacked Israel. Malaysia, like Indonesia, is a Muslim nation. The TV in my room was not showing any of the major US news outlets although this is a major US-branded hotel. I read multiple US-based news sources each day that span the political spectrum. I also peruse independent and personal sources from around the world. Much like everywhere, the news in Penang was condemning the Hamas attacks. Unlike much of the world, they were already raising a red flag about the Israeli and Western response. We have now seen that their concerns were valid as the death toll has surpassed 8,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians. This death toll will far exceed these numbers as Israel has already declared that this will be a long war. What I was watching in Malaysia was not what others were watching in Israel, the US, or other parts of the world. They presented a narrative that was aligned with their audience and national beliefs.

Moore We made a choice. In one universe, it seemed to be right. Maybe it wasn’t in a parallel one. We were young. We made a choice. Men aren’t usually allowed to discuss the topic of abortion. There is no question that the mother carries the majority of the burden from conception through the first few years of breastfeeding. There is no equal to a mother carrying a child. There is joy and sadness, vitality and pain. It is arguably the most meaningful role in raising a child. Without children, we perish. Children are hope. And the mother carries this hope. But a child cannot be made alone. It requires two people to make a baby. Sometimes there are accidents. In most cases it was a mutual decision to have a baby, two people who care for and are attracted to each other. While giving birth is a biological process, for those who have shared in the experience it is more of a miracle. So when we discuss abortion, it is complicated. We have long ago moved beyond the simple agreement that we need children in the world for the species to survive. The debate now flourishes in the realm of politics. You are either Pro-Life or Pro-Choice. Or, as the extremists in each camp like to espouse, a sexist or a murderer. I can understand the passion behind the discussion. Maybe if we had had a more equitable world where men and women were treated more equally, this wouldn’t have turned into a divisive topic. But women have fought for the right to vote, equal pay, and greater protection from domestic violence in their own homes. The narrative of my body, my choice logically evolved from this situation. And the Pro-Life argument is equally logical and understandable. A life begins at inception. We can debate how evolved that life is but there is no question that life has begun.

Chronic knee pain stopped me from enjoying many fun aspects of life. Hiking, team sports, and as I got older, even stairs would spark a symphony of cracks and pops. Here’s how I bulletproofed my knees, hips, and ankles, for free, with one simple exercise practiced a few times per week. Today, chronic knee pain is a way of life for 25% of adults. Yet, most people aren’t born with degenerative knee diseases. And, our joints weren’t made to give way after just a few decades. The problem is our way of life. We sit too much, work too much, and exercise the same parts of our bodies over and over again. Missing the parts that really matter. How often have you heard someone say this? Probably about as often as you hear bodybuilders complain about shoulder pain or runners suffering from shin splints. The knees are the body’s 2 largest joints, and we use them for almost everything. Walking, crouching, sitting, standing, and bending over. Yet, most people don’t know how to strengthen them. Or, keep them healthy… Humans weren’t built to be the biggest or strongest mammals on Earth. But, our unique knee joints have given us a biological advantage over the rest of the animal kingdom. Yet we squander our gift. We walk primarily on flat ground, take elevators, and avoid movements that strengthen our knees. All of this, causes us to devolve much quicker than nature intended. Resulting in knee pain, painful surgeries, and the limiting belief that you were born with “bad knees”. "

The perfect turkey. The mouth-watering pies. The beautifully set table. The incredibly awkward moments with family members you barely know — and whose attitudes and opinions make you want to pack up and leave the country. It’s sad but true. For many people, the very holiday that’s meant to spark gratitude and harmony has become an occasion for tension and anxiety. When tempers flare — which they often do — it may be tempting to take up smoking in the garage or burying yourself in your cell phone. But consider this: Just as good cooks must learn the skills necessary to roast the perfect turkey, family members wishing to avoid drama must adopt some key social skills — those small actions that give others the attention, understanding, and respect we all crave. Before we dig into brain science and solutions, a little background on families. These are the people in our lives who can bring us to the highest highs, and the lowest lows. According to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center, most people in the US and around the world consider their families to be the biggest source of meaning in their lives. So it makes sense that the opposite is true: There’s nothing more upsetting than family conflict. Unlike The Brady Bunch or Leave It to Beaver, real-life families can be a huge mess. Even among the most well-adjusted, tension is normal and crises are par for the course. If there’s conflict in your clan, you might see this as evidence you’re doing everything wrong. But Arthur C. Brooks, a professor at Harvard Business School where he teaches courses on happiness, says that’s hogwash. In his new book, Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier, co-written with Oprah Winfrey, Brooks says, “In truth, family unhappiness due to conflict is a signal that something important is right where it should be.

Thanks for the confidence, honey. I get her point, though. Generally speaking, women outlive men. But the gap in terms of years continues to grow even as the US overall life expectancy drops much faster than comparable developed countries. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation: But it is the gap between men and women that is interesting. A new JAMA research letter released yesterday confirms a worsening gap that is bigger than it has been in almost 20 years. The life expectancy gap between sexes increased 0.23 years from 2010 to 2019 and 0.70 years from 2019 to 2021. So, a much larger jump has been seen in the last few years compared to the decade prior. From 2010–2019, the biggest contributor to the gap was from unintentional injuries. From 2019–2021, COVID-19 took over as the main contributor to the gap. Unintentional injuries came in a close second, and the authors postulate that this is likely mostly from drug overdose deaths. So, the data is essentially saying COVID had a disproportionately higher toll on men than women. The likelihood of this has to do with the overall reasons why men die at younger ages compared to women. COVID accelerated that decline, it seems. This partially explains more COVID deaths in men, but there are many reasons postulated as to why there is a gap at all. I want to touch on three key… "

No, I decide to keep the insult inside my head where it belongs. After all, I’ve helped raise her, so I’m ultimately to blame. I pull up to the school entrance, put my car in park, and gaze at my 11-year-old daughter, who faces me just long enough for me to register the stink eye. She exits the car and slams the door behind her. I do nothing. Strike two. It isn’t even 9 a.m. — I haven’t had so much as a drop of coffee yet — and I’ve already managed to commit two of parenting’s biggest faux pas: losing my cool and failing to say goodbye when angry. I’m killing it over here. The little earthquake that erupted at drop-off this morning can be traced back to the breakfast table where my daughter explained why her friend, Blake, couldn’t participate in last Friday’s school-sponsored pajama day. Students who brought in canned goods for the Community Pantry Drive were allowed to wear pajamas to school that day; those who didn’t, couldn’t. (My husband calls bullshit on the whole thing and accuses school administrators of using kids’ desire to wear pjs to school as leverage, which inadvertently puts the children of parents who can’t afford to contribute in a precarious position. I agree with my husband, but that’s neither here nor there.) “Blake said that he told his mom too late, so she didn’t have time to get to the store,” my daughter explains between bites of her cereal. But that probably isn’t true. I know things about Blake’s mother’s financial situation — and not because I pry but because I can put two and two together: The countless times my daughter has asked me for extra lunch money (in case Blake forgot his); the time I’ve caught her putting two granola bars in her backpack for afternoon snack (again, in case Blake forgot his); the time I paid for Blake’s portion of the… "

When faced with difficult decisions we are encouraged to “go with our gut” or “follow our heart”. There is a base assumption that there is some wisdom in how we feel that gives us instruction on how to live our best lives and become our best selves. And yet, in the world of psychotherapy, it seems as though a great many individuals struggle with their emotions. Emotions become symptoms whose instructions lead to self-sabotaging, destructive, and painful consequences. Depression convinces us that there is little to no hope and that our efforts at trying will end in failure. Anxiety pleads with us to prepare for the worst or to avoid the worst-case scenarios that feel inevitable. If anything, the hallmark of poor mental health is that our emotions betray us. We feel sad, fearful, or upset even when nothing seems wrong. We feel unsatisfied in spite of everything seemingly going well. “Nothing’s wrong.” My client remarks, “I just wonder if I’ll ever be happy. Everything is fine, I mean, everything on paper is just fine. I have friends and a good job. But I think something’s wrong that I can’t just be happy.” But that’s just people with mental health issues, right? Surely, someone who has good mental health should be able to trust their emotions? The long story short is this; our emotions are projective and prediction-based. When we are navigating the world, much of our emotional experience is one of anticipation. At any given time you might ask yourself, Your feelings and emotions will oftentimes be a direct reflection of how you answer this question. If you imagine that something exciting, enjoyable, and pleasant is coming next, then you will feel a sense of excitement, joy, and positive anticipation.

We only recently began to discover scientific answers to these questions, and our knowledge is still far from complete. So, we’re fairly ignorant even today; how did pre-scientific people view the origins of life and the basis of health? For thousands of years, people in the West believed in an idea called spontaneous generation and the theory of four ‘humours’. Like many aspects of the modern West, these theories of life and health trace back to ancient Greece. The relevant history occurred in the period of Classical Antiquity, which stretched from the 8th century BC to the 5th century AD. In ancient Greece, conventional views on the nature of life were different from our modern understanding. Obviously, it was well known that heterosexual sex can result in pregnancy and childbirth. However it was widely believed that simpler forms of life simply sprang into existence from non-living matter. This idea was known as spontaneous generation, and major figures like Aristotle championed it. The concept seems wild by modern standards, but its advocates had arguments that were difficult to disprove before discovering microbes. For example, ancient people noticed how maggots would appear inside rotting meat. Since a dead animal could hardly give birth to insects, people reasoned that the dead animal’s body must provide raw material for maggots to spontaneously generate. Ancient people also applied this reasoning to other cases, suggesting that dust created fleas, and that bread/wheat left in corners gave rise to mice. Of course, it goes without saying that mating was another obvious way that life is created. But when met with the apparently sudden… "

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

It’s probably most famous for its role as an anabolic steroid in professional sport and bodybuilding, and has been closely associated with aggression and violence (e.g., the infamous ‘roid rage’). This seems to make intuitive sense. After all, men have vastly more testosterone than women, men are far more violent and aggressive than women, and going through puberty with male levels of testosterone confers much greater physical strength. Everything seems to check out, and the notion that testosterone causes aggression and violence satisfies our intuitions. But as you’ve likely guessed, there’s more to the story. Before we discuss aggression, violence, and competition, we’ll quickly cover the basics about what testosterone is and where it comes from. If you’re not interested in these details, feel free to skip to the next section. Testosterone is a type of hormone known as an anabolic steroid, but what does that actually mean? A hormone is a chemical that’s released in one organ of the body (e.g., reproductive organs or adrenal glands) in order to act on other organs of the body (e.g., the brain). Steroids are naturally-occurring chemicals that can act as hormones. Steroid hormones belong to two main categories, depending on where in the body they’re synthesised. Testosterone is primarily synthesised in the gonads, meaning testes in men and ovaries in women. Smaller amounts are also released by the adrenal glands that sit atop our kidneys, and by fat cells. The other type of steroid is synthesised in part of the adrenal glands known as the adrenal cortex. Because they’re synthesised in the adrenal cortex, these steroid hormones are known as corticosteroids. This class of hormones includes… "

Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance.

Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially.

Israel just makes it easier to notice, but harder to talk about openly in a world where secular people still believe they can sweep these problems under a rug.

In a winner take all, if the 1.3 million Haredi (ultra-orthodox Jews) battled Hamas and the surrounding 2 million Arabs in Gaza who would win? Answer, the Haredi Jews seldom take part in Israel’s Defense Forces so Hamas would win. If the 3.5 million secular Jews of Israel battled Gaza who would win? (Let’s assume Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the West Bank sit it out). Answer, the secular Jews would ultimately win but the number of casualties on both sides would be greater than the recent growth in ultra-orthodox and Zionist populations in Israel. In other words, secular Jews would leave Israel with a greater population of hard-right Jews, whether you count them as Orthodox or Zionist. Demographics is destiny, after all. You want to know why Israel didn’t go hard-charging in Gaza immediately. I bet that problem is lurking in everyone’s mind in the IDF. The problem of secular Jews losing control of Israel is easily visible in Israel’s inability to form a stable government in the past few years.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing.

I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks as long as I can remember. I remember laying on the floor in fetal position wishing my parents would just hug me while I felt this out-of-control heart racing that would make me feel so scared. Also, for as long as I can remember I struggled with shoulder pain. I remember in my late teens getting shopping carts at stores I was only browsing at because my purse would cause my shoulder. Over the years I have noticed a connection between my physical pain and anxiety concerns. Days when my pain is worse, I have noticed I am more anxious. When I have a higher-level pain day, I notice that anxiety seems to increase as well. Pain and anxiety go hand in hand. Often it seems that one is not found without the other. Many people who suffer from chronic pain and chronic anxiety find that they cannot tell which one started first. There is a phenomenon called the pain cycle, where the pain one experiences causes a reaction in the body, muscle tightening and guarding, decreased movement and then atrophy of the muscles. The decrease mobility contributes to more anxiety and emotional distress. The cycle continues until it is corrected. In reality, the cycle can be started at any point in the loop. You may have an injury that resulted in loss of motion and caused muscle atrophy, the muscle guarding, that physicality in your body can lead to your brain perceiving an imminent threat and increasing feelings of anxiety. It could also be that it begins with anxiety that causes muscle tension, muscle guarding, decrease movement, and then that increases pain sensations in the body. Not only can the causes be one or the other, but the perception of pain is also dependent on anxiety levels as well. The regions for pain and anxiety in the brain are overlapping. This means that the brain reads both in a similar way. One example is this double-blind study, which showed that people reacted less severely to social rejection. The participants who consumed a pain reliever seemed less bothered by not being chosen to play a game than the participants who received a placebo. That would indicate that the opposite is also true. If people who have heightened pain may have heightened anxiety and those who have heightened anxiety may also have higher pain levels. That is not to say that we should all consume acetaminophen daily or at all for anxiety, it is an interesting finding that may help us better understand the connection between anxiety and pain. Chronic pain, as well as chronic anxiety conditions, can mean that this loop is constantly cycling through. For people with chronic conditions, this cycle may be worse when one or the other parts of the loop are worse. For example, let's say you have chronic knee pain. It was caused by an injury several years ago, and most days it is manageable. But on this particular day, you also have a huge deadline that is looming over you from work. As you start going through your day you notice that the knee is hurting more that day as well. The addition of the extra stress will increase the anxiety and cause more significant pain reactions and thus cause the whole cycle to be increased. The perception of the pain increased, but the injury did not. The reverse is true as well, on a day that you have a positive thing happening, let’s say a party you are excited to attend, you may have a lessened perception of the pain in the injury. The common denominator in this is the nervous system. In both pain as well as anxiety responses, the brain goes to fight or flight. The brain is attempting to protect itself. In acute situations that may be helpful. In chronic pain and anxiety conditions, people become conditioned to adjusting their behavior to avoid the painful stimuli and that can increase the pain as well. Knowing the connection is just the beginning, and to some extent, this is good news. It means that you can find relief in both areas by beginning to treat one. Ultimately managing chronic conditions like pain and anxiety is a lifelong commitment. It requires a change in your lifestyle and a dedication to getting to know what works for your individual body as well. The suggestions above are not a substitution for medical care. If you are experiencing chronic pain and chronic anxiety, it is important to be under the care of a medical professional to help you manage the condition. Finding ways to decrease either the pain or the anxiety can be incredibly helpful in maintaining a quality of life that we all want and aspire to. No one deserves to live a life of pain, either emotional or physical. "

Understandably, after extensive destabilizing and debilitating abuse calculated to heighten sympathetic arousal and catapult the victim into PTSD symptoms of flooding and dissociation, examining how one’s long-held beliefs and cognitive biases about the human condition may have factored into becoming malleable supply, can feel like harmful self incrimination. Undeniably, the weight of extensive smear campaigns, incessant lies and the narcissist’s recruitment of friends, family and colleagues to conquer and divide, takes its toll on victims. With this in mind, in the aftermath of having one’s character torn to shreds, feeling increasingly untethered, fearful, and doubtful of one’s perceptions, one is simply not inclined to self-reflect. Rather, the survivor is struggling with breaking through a fog of cognitive dissonance while cutting ties from an abuser who is relentlessly employing strategies to reignite a connection. Moreover, rather than the victim’s deterioration being viewed as evidence of abuse, they are stigmatized and perceived as delusional and problematic. Not being believed while the narcissist, who seems contrite and concerned is lauded and supported by those who erroneously give credence to a skewed fictional narrative, exacerbates the victim’s state of trauma and alienation. It’s no wonder after prolonged dehumanization and stigmatization, survivors are reluctant to turn the focus on how their way of thinking and operating may have contributed to being targeted as supply.

Gone are the days when the word “psychology” evoked a pretentious, pipe-smoking erudite furrowing his brow at the free association of a couch-bound neurotic. While many still consider the field pseudoscience, most can at least acknowledge its practicality. Therapy is helpful. Depression is real. Anxiety is more common than the common cold, and trauma can strike any of us in a thousand monstrous forms. Particularly with younger generations, it is no longer taboo to express these realities out loud. And yet, our collective understanding of ADHD lags painfully behind. The past two decades have yielded breakthroughs. A problem once limited to young boys who couldn’t sit still, its scope has expanded from these restless students to people of all genders, ages and walks of life. We now recognize ADHD as a developmental, far-reaching and potentially lifelong disorder of executive functioning — a disorder that one does not simply “grow out of.” With brain imaging technology, structural differences have emerged in the ADHD cortices to hint at etiology. Our understanding has progressed lightyears. Still, in many cases, ADHD goes unnoticed. You may find the notion preposterous, given the perception that ADHD is overdiagnosed and overprescribed — so much so, one might argue, that an unreasonable demand has exacerbated the current shortage of stimulant medication like Adderall — but it’s true. For a significant minority of people with ADHD, diagnosis remains elusive. Help never arrives. They never learn to cope with what amounts to a profound neurodivergence because they never even realize they have it. The people to whom I’m referring are the highly intelligent, or “gifted,” as they are often called in childhood. Ironically, for those with ADHD, the “gift” of intelligence can behave more like a curse. The cognitive aptitude of which their parents are so proud, their peers so envious and their college admissions committees so desirous becomes the very thing blocking them from the help they need. Their intelligence becomes a heavy cloak around their suffering, hiding it from sight. "

The list goes on and the numbers are growing. Yet as of 2021, only 12% of men are in ongoing mental health support with a counselor or psychologist. Men seem more likely to accept their mental health concerns as a personality trait or mask their symptoms in lieu of getting any kind of mental health care. Depression and anxiety affect women at twice the rate of men, but despite this fact, men are succumbing to suicide at four times the rate as women. This is a serious crisis among men. Socializing Men are often taught that only weak men need to get therapy. In their social circles, men are often told that therapy is for weak-minded men or made to feel that they are bad at being a man if they need it. Hypermasculine jobs, which oftentimes are more psychologically damaging and traumatic than average, project the biggest overtly gendered bias about therapy and therefore make it less likely that men who may suffer from trauma due to their job stress and experiences are less likely to receive help for it. What can sometimes end up happening when men are dealing with mental health struggles, in order to avoid the stigma associated with mental healthcare among their peers, is that they turn their frustrations and shame on their family members. We saw this with the increase of domestic violence issues during the pandemic. This last June, during men’s health awareness month, a friend of mine lost her father to the tragedy of suicide. He had spent years fighting thoughts of ending his life and finally, just before Father’s Day, lost his battle to depression. Men are more likely to be in jobs that carry inherent risk to mental health. Jobs like military, firefighters, and police are filled with situations that can lead to p.t.s.d. and other anxiety-related concerns. For the last 20 years my own spouse has been a police officer and though he is thankfully in therapy himself, constantly struggles with his hypervigilance and need for control to be safe. Things like where we sit in a restaurant and when we go to a movie have become routine in our relationship. He has had so many times over the last 20 years feeling inadequate and out of control because of the fear he has built up from the experiences he has had. In our current society, specifically in the United States, as that is the place I live and am familiar with, men’s mental health has been minimized, stigmatized, and understudied. Because of the lack of attention and research given to men’s mental health, we don’t know very much about the social structures of men and how they can use their social interactions to help their mental health. In a self-reported analysis, some men reported that they used their intimate partners as their primary means of working through their emotional needs. This created a public image of the masculine ideal that society has placed on them, while still managing their own emotional needs. The big issue that could come from using your intimate partner as your sole emotional outlet, is that it may eventually overwhelm your partner. It would be difficult for one person to be the sole emotional support system for anyone. If the partner is also caring for small children or their own mental health concerns, that will diminish the capability they have to assist the man in need. I am not proposing that men become women. I am suggesting that men start to destigmatize emotional support for each other. In whatever way that feels natural for men. I am not a man. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of masculine relationships and friendships. I do know that something needs to change. Men need emotional connection, and our society is becoming less and less connected. If the only friendship interaction men have is playing violent video games on Twitch streams, I do not see that bettering the stigma about emotional health. If we start to create a narrative for men that it is safe to reach out, safe to interact with others and talk about their emotional health, that may be a way to reach men and start to change the culture about mental health for men. Men’s mental health affects us all. We cannot thrive as a society if half the population is failing to thrive. We are only as strong as our weakest players and that means we all need to prioritize men’s mental health. We can start to shift the narrative as women, talking to men about therapy, taking our son’s emotional needs seriously, listening to their feelings without bias. We can start to demand therapy from our partners and significant others. We need to de-stigmatize men who go to therapy and start rewarding them. Showing the other men that women don’t want that “strong silent type” anymore. We want the emotionally mature and compassionate type. We want men who have faced their shame and trauma and have healed. We want men who are emotionally, physically, and mentally safe. And that only comes with working through the difficult emotional and mental health junk. "

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

Of course, everything from genetics to childhood experience has some influence on how confident you feel (or don’t). But by far the biggest influence on confidence is the one everyone seems to miss… In my work as a psychologist, I’ve found that there are a handful of confidence-killing habits people fall into without knowing it. And it’s these habits that are the real causes of chronically low confidence. If you can learn to identify and work through them, you’ll find that your natural levels of confidence are much higher than you realize. Reassurance-seeking is like outsourcing emotional labor onto other people. And not only does it kill your confidence, it also tends to sabotage your relationships and lead to people becoming resentful of you. Here’s a small example: "

I started writing this on October 7th, and I’ve been writing it ever since. Even though this awful war is not about you (Western, mainly White leftists), I’ve been finding myself having full conversations with you in my head. I tried to tell myself it doesn’t matter what you think, to focus on myself, on the people impacted, on what I believe in. But here I am, spending my energy on you. Because I’m surrounded by you and it overwhelms me. This might not be worded perfectly, I might ramble or not make sense. We’re on day 19 of hell, so we do what we can. This is not the most urgent thing to talk about right now, I know that. As I write this, there are still over 200 people held hostage by Hamas, civilians, mothers, babies, elderly. There are thousands dead in Gaza, hundreds of funerals in Israel and so many bodies still not identified. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing so quickly. Like I said, day 19 of hell. 19 straight days of the most horrific accounts, pictures, and videos I’ve ever seen, that I truly wish I could unsee and un-know. The images of babies in Gaza buried under rubble, of babies in Israel burnt alive, of old women taken hostage, of mothers trying to protect their families with their own bodies. I feel these images rattling inside me, all sharp edges, leaving their marks. I can’t look at a child without being reminded. I can’t look at my own grandma without being reminded. This is all we can think about. So it bears repeating: release the hostages, declare a ceasefire, help the survivors, start working towards a real, long term solution. Even though we have so many awful, urgent things happening all around us, I’m still writing this now. Writing is how I make sense of things and I need to make sense of the difficult feelings so many of us on the Israeli left have been experiencing in the last two weeks. These awful two weeks that feel like one long awful day. I’m writing this out of immense pain and grief, from my own perspective as an anti-occupation Israeli, to try and explain a bit what this has been like for me, for us. I want to note that this is not for those of you who celebrated what happened on October 7th. If you felt any joy in your heart about hundreds of civilians getting slaughtered in their beds, about children getting executed in front of their parents, about grandparents sacrificing themselves to save their grandkids, about horrors that I can’t even handle describing— I truly have nothing to say to you. Whatever is wrong with you is too deep and I want nothing to do with it until you figure that out. This is for those of you who know that what happened is, at the very least, sad. For those who treated this absolute nightmare as an unfortunate situation that we had coming. For those who didn’t celebrate but instead stayed silent. Who were so quick to lecture us about context and resistance from the comfort of your homes. Those who were so eager to share hot takes calling us losers who don’t understand decolonization while terrorists were still hunting down survivors to finish the job. While we were still searching through snuff videos of the massacre Hamas posted online, looking for signs of life or death from loved ones. Those who had the posts locked and loaded, ready to show us just how progressive and radical you are. This is for you. What really shocked me is how quick you were to know what’s right. On that awful Saturday, while little kids were still hiding in closets and under beds next to their parents’ dead bodies, before we even started counting our dead, you already knew what’s right. You already told us. You, who never faced such horrors and who couldn’t even imagine them, who never felt or will feel such real, immediate fear for your family and your people, you were ready with your posts telling us about privilege and the price of revolutions. And I can’t stop asking myself where you got the nerve. How you dared to sit comfortably in your home and casually post your little tweets and memes about how acceptable it is to slaughter us, in between your posts about brunch and your dog and your friend’s birthday? How dare you lecture us on how we should have reacted? What kind of subversive activism do you think you’re a part of when you’re being so careful not to express any understanding towards our grief? What do you think you’re fighting for? Sometimes I think some of us on the left have become so focused on pointing out what we perceive as subversive, as not obvious, that we fail to see the most simple and obvious of things. That we’ve gotten so used to this oppositional standpoint that we find ourselves so far removed from the values that are supposed to be at our core. Values of humanity, solidarity, justice, peace. How did we find ourselves condoning (if by silence, omission, doubt, or something worse) the cold blooded, planned, systematic murder of children, women, entire families? I don’t know exactly where we took a wrong turn but I’m praying we find our way back. There is obviously the personal hurt here. We’re going through unimaginable amounts of grief, and even in the worst of it, you couldn’t spare us a hint of kindness. You were so committed to finding and aligning yourself with the party line that you couldn’t show us an inch of humanity. So careful not to commit the awful sin of supporting the evil colonizers, of humanizing the enemy, of normalizing our existence. So careful that you could not allow yourself to acknowledge our pain, even if you’ve known us for years. So yes, there is personal hurt. A lot of it. It’s really hard having your friends turn on you, chastise you, doubt you, or just completely ignore you when you’re going through the worst nightmare you could imagine. You’ve compounded our grief, and taken away from your own humanity by doing so. That is for you to figure out now. There is also a bigger hurt here. The damage we could see you making to what activists in the region have been working towards for so long. On October 7th you were gleefully explaining justice to us, but we on the Israeli left already knew what awaited us and the people of Gaza. We knew hell was about to be unleashed on them and that nothing inspiring, revolutionary, or progressive was about to happen. We knew that Palestinian civilians were about to pay for what Hamas did, and that so much more grief was just around the corner. While you lectured us about decolonization, we were already grieving the children of Gaza. You played right into the hands of the most right-wing, fascist Israeli voices. Those who have been telling us that no one cares about our lives, that Palestinians would slaughter us like animals if given the chance, that our friends on the left would celebrate it. That our activism and anti-occupation work will not save us. You have made it so incredibly hard for us to explain that this is not what we’re fighting for. That this isn’t what Palestinians want for us. That this is not a price anyone should ever ever have to pay. Palestinians directly affected by this showed us grace during this awful time, knowing that our fates are tied together, while you chose to tell us that this is just how the cookie crumbles. You, who did not witness the horrors that we’re trying to stop, closed your hearts to us quicker than many of our Palestinian friends, who were the ones actually experiencing them. People who lost so much have shown more humanity to the “other side” than you even dared to entertain. What excuse do you have? We didn’t ask you to wave an Israeli flag. We didn’t ask you to say this is just as bad as what’s happened in Gaza. We just asked you for basic human sympathy, we asked you to say this is unacceptable. We asked you to let us grieve and to grieve with us, just as we will continue to grieve with the people of Gaza. It shouldn’t be this hard for you. It cannot be this hard for you. Yes, we know you think this is a narrative that gets enough attention. That politicians and the media have already condemned it and you don’t want to join them in their “we stand with Israel” parade. We know you think it’s been repeated so much it doesn’t even matter anymore. But you know what — it matters to us, and we’re going to need to hear it from you. You are supposed to be the ones who care about justice, our allies in this fight, not the media and the politicians. If this is the vision you have for liberation then we never have been and never will be allies. I’m at a loss at what some of you think Israeli anti-occupation activists should do. Is the right thing to accept any act of violence as legitimate, as long as it’s done in the name of decolonization? Is it for us to get down on our knees with our hands up and let ourselves be raped and murdered for freedom? Is it to let our families be slaughtered and say nothing other than “any act of resistance against an oppressor is legitimate”? Maybe you will be kind enough to allow us to grieve. Obviously quietly, privately, lest we push the wrong narrative. Or maybe we just need to go back to where we came from? To truly decolonize all of Palestine? Should we go back to Poland, to Iraq, Germany, Russia, Yemen, or would you like to host us at your place? The Zionist project is not something I ever celebrated, but you need to understand that unlike many of your colonial ancestors, we did not come to Palestine out of some imperial dream. We didn’t come to conquer or even to find a better life. We came as refugees. As survivors of pogroms and the Farhud and forced displacement and yes, the Holocaust. We know, we’ve said many times, the Holocaust wasn’t the Palestinians’ fault. It doesn’t justify the occupation or excuse any of the atrocities committed by the Israeli government. But it does provide that thing you crave— context. It does mean that we have nowhere else to go. It means that Israelis and Palestinians will continue to live and die together on this small piece of land. This is it for us. I know you’re tired of hearing about the Holocaust. It’s ancient history. An excuse we cynically use to justify everything the Israeli government does. You think we have to let it go, because we’re not those same poor sad Jews anymore, now we’re the bad guys, with our strong army that protects us from everything (well). But sometimes I remember that Anne Frank was born 6 months after my grandma. My 94-year-old grandma, who still tries to make it in time to the bomb shelter at her assisted living facility, every time there’s a siren (she fails most of the time, she moves rather slowly). This is the context we’re working with, the fear that’s burnt into our DNA by centuries of persecution. A fear that, despite knowing our history, I never felt quite as strongly as I did on October 7th. A fear I tried to push aside because I believe it takes courage, trust, and faith to work towards real peace instead of towards war. It takes believing your allies and those you seek to make peace with can see your humanity. This is that fascist talking point — we need to be able to defend ourselves, at all costs. Pity will not help us, being moral will not help us, we need to survive. If our lives are fair game in this thing you so happily called resistance, decolonization, freedom, then where the hell does that leave us? If you won’t speak up for even the most vulnerable and innocent of us, our babies and our elderly, then what choice do you leave Israelis with any sense of self preservation other than to continue to live by our sword? Other than understanding that our lives are worthless to the world, with no one but ourselves to count on? Israeli activists have been advocating for decades that our future, our safety, our freedom, is tied with that of the Palestinians. That it’s not a zero sum game — it’s the opposite. That we live together or die together. That it’s not us against them — it’s war mongers and corrupt politicians against the rest of us. Against the people. Us killing and hating each other won’t make us safer or better off. It only bolsters our most power-hungry leaders. We’re trying to maintain our humanity in the face of the most brutal and cruel attack on our people since the Holocaust. In the face of horrors so awful that I have to actively push them out of my mind because I know I will buckle under their weight. We’re trying to remind ourselves and each other that all life is sacred, that our freedoms aren’t mutually exclusive, that, quite simply, killing innocent people is wrong. We shouldn’t have to remind you as well. Israeli anti-Zionist activists have been working endlessly, side by side with Palestinians, against the occupation. Some of us have dedicated our lives to it, all of us have paid a price for it. You are a guest in this struggle and your position on it has cost you nothing. You have sacrificed nothing. You can do it comfortably and without consequence, and the result of it will not impact your life or safety. Israel and Palestine could both disappear off the face of the earth in a cloud of blood and smoke, and your life will remain almost unchanged. You might lose a couple of friends, post about it on Instagram for a week or so, and have some awkward office conversation. Then your life will go on. But our lives and those of our families and communities depend on the consequences of this struggle. We don’t expect praise or thanks for our work against the occupation and we truly don’t do any of this for you, but we do expect basic human empathy. Yes, we know Palestinians don’t get basic human empathy from so many people, we know they’re not heard. This is what we’re fighting for. But we will not erase ourselves and our families in the process, because, like I’ve said, all of us maintaining our humanity in this struggle is simply not negotiable. We definitely won’t negotiate it with you. Your aspirations of decolonization are theories. They’re something you would never have to face yourself. You’ll never be the collateral damage in this kind of freedom fighting, you’ll never have to pay a price for it. Your family will never be slaughtered at the altar of anti-colonialism, yet you’re willing to sacrifice our families. You’ll never be told to leave your home and go back to wherever you came from (even though you were born there). Your history of colonialism is old enough, your history of genocide effective enough, that you and your family and everyone you love can continue to be safe and comfortable while you preach about armed resistance. I’m sure you wouldn’t dare criticize any violent act of decolonization acted upon you, but we’ll never truly know. I wouldn’t wish it upon you that we’ll ever find out. My heart breaks over and over as I see us trying to garner a shred of empathy from you. As we wave the pictures of our dead, the nightmarish stories of our survivors (that you were so quick to doubt and disregard), the horror videos of torture and murder that we will never be able to forget. As we plead and beg for you to care about the 200 people held hostage. We disrespect ourselves and our dead in this desperate attempt to shake you, to make you believe us. People in Israel and Palestine are being pitted against each other with our suffering. Forced to fight to show you the greatest horrors, the most death, the worst cruelty. Trying to win this made-up competition which only has losers. Each trying to scream at those on the other side who closed their hearts and minds to us: why can’t you see us? How could you justify this? Don’t you see we don’t deserve this? So we will swallow the pain you’ve caused us. Because, again, this isn’t about you. We’re not going to let you antagonize us from our own fight for justice. You won’t make us choose between our life and safety and the life and safety of the people in Gaza, or anywhere else in Israel or Palestine. We know that peace and justice are possible, we will be safe, and Palestinians will be safe. We will find a way, together. We have no other choice. Lastly, I want to share the ending of the poem Red Sea by Aurora Levins Morales. I’ve been finding myself repeating it in my head like a mantra. I recommend it. And a final tiny note: to the friends and allies who have managed to maintain their humanity and hold the complexity and the absolute horror of this situation with us — we cannot thank you enough. Thank you for caring, thank you for treating us with decency and patience. Thank you for looking beyond the slogans. Thank you for seeing that we’re just humans on both sides of this. Thank you for believing that we all deserve better. "

And you don’t have a clue. That’s what I’m thinking, but, luckily, I’m able to summon the self-control to prevent myself from saying it. No, I decide to keep the insult inside my head where it belongs. After all, I’ve helped raise her, so I’m ultimately to blame. I pull up to the school entrance, put my car in park, and gaze at my 11-year-old daughter, who faces me just long enough for me to register the stink eye. She exits the car and slams the door behind her. I do nothing. Strike two. It isn’t even 9 a.m. — I haven’t had so much as a drop of coffee yet — and I’ve already managed to commit two of parenting’s biggest faux pas: losing my cool and failing to say goodbye when angry. I’m killing it over here. The little earthquake that erupted at drop-off this morning can be traced back to the breakfast table where my daughter explained why her friend, Blake, couldn’t participate in last Friday’s school-sponsored pajama day. Students who brought in canned goods for the Community Pantry Drive were allowed to wear pajamas to school that day; those who didn’t, couldn’t. (My husband calls bullshit on the whole thing and accuses school administrators of using kids’ desire to wear pjs to school as leverage, which inadvertently puts the children of parents who can’t afford to contribute in a precarious position. I agree with my husband, but that’s neither here nor there.) “Blake said that he told his mom too late, so she didn’t have time to get to the store,” my daughter explains between bites of her cereal. But that probably isn’t true. I know things about Blake’s mother’s financial situation — and not because I pry but because I can put two and two together: The countless times my daughter has asked me for extra lunch money (in case Blake forgot his); the time I’ve caught her putting two granola bars in her backpack for afternoon snack (again, in case Blake forgot his); the time I paid for Blake’s portion of the… "

It was my first appointment, and I was sitting alone in the waiting room as a woman was choking on her tears on the other side of the door. Every word they exchanged was audible, and I felt so uncomfortable that I didn’t know where to look. Until, that is, my eyes rested on a row of pink felt slippers of varying sizes, which were laid out on the floor outside the consultation room. This wasn’t looking good at all. I was living in Berlin at the time, in the mid-2000s. The health insurance system in Germany meant you could have one initial session with up to five different psychotherapists before deciding which one to go with. This, I thought, was a good thing because I suspected every therapeutic relationship was unique and its success depended to a certain extent on the chemistry between the individuals concerned. So, when Number 5 asked me to take off my shoes, I immediately started reviewing my earlier options. “Have you brought your own slippers with you?” He asked. My mouth opened, but no words came out. Of course I hadn’t brought my bloody slippers with me. I was there for psychotherapy, not a sleepover. It felt gross wearing footwear shared by complete strangers, so I curled up my toes to minimize contact with the felt. I still couldn’t focus on the session, though. How could I lay bare my soul when in all probability someone was sitting outside the door listening to every single thing I said? The session ended with the therapist asking me to place one hand on my chest and the other on my stomach. I was then told to close my eyes, focus on my breathing, and tell him how I felt in that precise moment. “Stupid,” I said, without a second thought. Needless to say, he was not The One. Most of the psychotherapists I saw were listed as ‘gay-friendly’ or ‘queer-friendly’. This was important for me partly because I didn’t want to risk facing discrimination. Remember, homosexuality was widely considered to be a mental illness in itself until relatively… "

https://medium.com/startuphealth/predictive-healthcare-helps-anticipate-and-prevent-surgical-site-infections-00d5eca7d8f5?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"When a friend talked Talal Ali Ahmad, a software engineer who worked in telecom infrastructure, into volunteering his skills to the Global Smile Foundation (GSF), Ali Ahmad had no idea he’d end up a medtech entrepreneur. It was 2012, and he was taking the year off after his company, Centrix, was acquired. Soon Ali Ahmad was traveling extensively on medical missions to help provide IT infrastructure and tech support to the Global Smile surgeons as they performed corrective procedures for people with cleft lips and cleft palates. “This really started my exposure to the medical field,” says Ali Ahmad. “I quickly started to identify some problems we could use tech to help solve.” One such problem was monitoring patients for surgical site infections following the procedures. When the Global Smile Foundation surgeons arrived, there’d immediately be a queue stretched down the block. They’d treat as many patients as they could and discharge the patients and provide instructions on how to take care of their wounds. The majority of the patients lived far and it was difficult for them to return for a followup appointment with the local surgeon. As one surgeon put it, “the patients go home and we don’t hear from them or see them unless they end up in the emergency room.” Ali Ahmad dug into it and soon realized that this wasn’t just an issue in countries with limited access to medical resources. The reported infection rate of open incision surgeries is between 10–30%. These infections lead to major complications, increasing the risk of sepsis, major organ failure, and even death. It’s a costly problem as well, to the tune of more than $3.3B spent because of surgical site infections in the US annually. Before he began tackling the issue of remote incision site monitoring, Ali Ahmad co-founded a different medical device company in 2014 — Proximie, a virtual operating room which allowed surgeons to “scrub in” on a surgery from a distance. It started as a way to address the need to train local doctors on how to address cleft palates, but it quickly transitioned to a resource the US doctors who work for GSF wanted to bring back to the states. All that to say, by the time he set his sights on infection sites, Ali Ahmad was well-versed in the way physicians, particularly surgeons, think. He knew their time was both limited and expensive and that you don’t want to be the one wasting it. He also knew physicians were tired of having to download and utilize new apps and wanted all relevant patient information to be on their EMRs (electronic medical records). Ali Ahmad set out to create a way to virtually monitor surgical sites that seamlessly integrated into the normal workflow of the clinicians. The key to its success rested in the accuracy and actionability of its data: how well can the AI in the digital platform detect early signs of surgical site infection (SSI) and prevent readmission? He and his team of engineers and programmers set to work, creating a system to analyze wound photos and up to 30 other key performance indicators, such as the patient’s temperature, pain levels, medication adherence, and wound temperature When they had a beta version ready, they found willing trial partners in the Global Smile Foundation, who set up 300 patients and their families to use the tool to monitor their postoperative surgical sites. This early trial was a success, with an 85% patient compliance rate and an 80% prediction accuracy rate — numbers high enough to prove the usefulness of the tool and push the team forward to train the AI towards even greater precision. Predictive Healthcare’s first offering, MyHealthPal, is an AI-based digital platform that predicts surgical site infections remotely, detecting early signs of trouble and preventing readmission and other post-surgical health complications. It’s a HIPAA-compliant solution that integrates seamlessly into a patient’s EMR, alerting physicians to infection risk and providing a comprehensive overview of the wound status and patient entered data to allow the care team to make quick decisions. In the typical day-to-day of surgery, a patient heads home with a stack of information on how to take care of their wound and little to no follow up from the healthcare team. The hospital workflow doesn’t offer an existing procedure on wound followup and healthcare providers often only hear from a patient when something’s gone wrong. MyHealthPal helps the patient track their healing progress, guiding them through taking clear pictures at the right angle, keeping track of changes and symptoms, which lets healthcare providers catch early signs of surgical site infections (SSIs) while antibiotics will still be effective. For abdominal and open incision surgeries–things like C-sections, colectomies, liver and pancreas surgeries, hernia surgeries, abdominal hysterectomies, and the like–this type of close monitoring is especially important because these procedures have double digit SSI rates. Not only does this represent an enormous amount of money spent on readmission costs, but it also hits hospitals on their CMS rating. Then there are surgeries involving an implantable device, like a knee or hip replacement or putting in a pacemaker–if an SSI arises after the procedure, it often means a complete redo where the entire apparatus is removed and replaced with a clean device. The hospital loses financially, the physician loses time, and the patient faces a longer recovery, additional missed work, and insurance issues. “MyHealthPal gives doctors the data they need to catch an infection early and prevent this cycle,” emphasizes Ahmad. Predictive Healthcare plans to take MyHealthPal to market this year, focusing on those surgeries with the highest SSI rates, such as colectomies. Using the data from their pilot, they’ve developed a clinical cost saving calculator and aim to reduce hospital readmission rate by as much as 50%. “In healthcare sales you have to get to the point, and our point is reducing that readmission rate.” Their target market will be hospitals and healthcare systems, private surgery centers, and accountable care organizations (ACOs), offering them an annual licensing fee to use the platform with a per patient cost for six months of monitoring. Predictive healthcare has found the surgeons themselves are their biggest champions in getting MyHealthPal into hospitals. As Ali Ahmad puts it, “once they get it and buy into its value, they lead the charge and take us up the ladder.” It’s been quite a journey for Ali Ahmad, from telecommunication to the healthcare world, but one he’s glad he made. Just recently he was sent a picture from the Global Smile Foundation of a two-year old boy named Gael in Ecuador whose parents monitored his healing after cleft lip surgery using MyHealthPal. “We designed our technology to make a real difference in surgical site infection monitoring, and it’s an honor to be part of a community transforming healthcare.” CEO Talal Ali Ahmad is a proven leader in the startup space with the stamina and patience it takes to see a company successfully off the ground. He’s put together a strong executive team as they prepare to launch this year, with proven track records in their various fields. We can’t wait to see what they accomplish with their first offering and how it continues to grow in the years ahead.

https://medium.com/startuphealth/tribetic-is-transforming-type-1-diabetes-management-through-personalization-integration-and-e7104fac31cf?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Imagine being handed a thousand jigsaw pieces but no picture on the box to show you how they fit together. For folks with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), this is an everyday reality. They have access to a wealth of data about their blood sugar levels but no information on how to interpret it or take actions to manage their condition better. It is like having a toolbox full of tools but no instructions on how to build anything. Now, to make matters even more puzzling, imagine some of those jigsaw pieces being missing. Existing solutions for T1D management often focus on just a few pieces of the diabetes puzzle. They might give you a glimpse of the bigger picture but leave out essential elements like nutrition, sleep, and physical activity. It’s as if you are handed a recipe with only half the ingredients, you’re left with something incomplete and unsatisfying. Enter TRIBETIC, a platform that takes a new approach to T1D management. Instead of just collecting data, it’s designed to interpret, integrate, and personalize it, making it more meaningful and actionable, improving quality of life. Dan Donlevie, an Ironman athlete, got his first taste of the struggles of diabetes management when he found himself mysteriously falling ill during the Ironman Lake Placid in his late 30s. “I wasn’t feeling great. I remember completing the 112 mile bike but on mile two of the run something was just not clicking. After throwing up, I was thinking, ‘how am I going to run the rest of this marathon?’ I knew it wasn’t lack of training or preparation, but I also didn’t know what was going on?” It turned out that Dan’s body wasn’t absorbing carbohydrates the way it should, and a little later, he was diagnosed with T1D, a revelation that rocked his world. Being a healthcare professional with a background in athletic training, physical therapy, and nutrition, Dan thought he was prepared. But despite his expertise, he found himself facing an entirely new challenge. Dan vividly recalls the early days of learning to manage the condition, testing different foods, and constantly monitoring his blood sugar levels. He had to become his own lab rat because there weren’t many resources available. Dan realized that the best insights into his body came during intense physical stress. “Your body adapts in terms of the way it handles things so you can go through your day as a person with diabetes. If you’re fairly inactive or sedentary, you are experiencing the same things on a much smaller scale. But when you start to stress your body, those adaptations start to surface much more readily.” Over the years, Dan’s diabetes management evolved from manual injections and finger pricks to continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps. He also began exploring wearable health devices like the Oura Ring and Whoop Straps. What struck him was the wealth of data available for athletes but the absence of integrated solutions catered toward people with diabetes. So Dan took matters into his own hands and started creating spreadsheets to understand the intricate relationship between exercise, nutrition, and blood sugar levels. In doing so, he discovered the highly personalized nature of diabetes management, understanding that what works for one person might not work for another. He also noticed a gap in the market–companies invested millions in creating software solutions for diabetes management but offered little or no guidance on how to interpret it. These apps showed what was going well and what was going wrong but didn’t provide instructions on how to manage the condition better. Furthermore, most diabetes management apps focused on just one biomarker–blood sugar levels–when there were many more elements that influenced metabolism and affected the blood sugar levels. However, it was challenging to break them down, but it is exactly what Dan wanted to do. Dan’s idea was simple: making T1D management highly personalized by integrating critical data about all aspects of metabolism–nutrition, physical activity, blood glucose levels, and more–helping people understand it and then creating individualized plans. Things started falling into place when Dan spoke to Suzanne Stites, an accomplished triathlete with whom he had shared a decade-long friendship. Suzanne had faced her own challenges: an equestrian accident from which she needed significant rehab. A few years after the accident Dan started to work with her to address her physical and metabolic challenges. She too is now doing Ironman triathlons. Suzanne also had a career creating health and wellness businesses. She has run and created multi-million dollar businesses. Her core drive was to make a difference in people’s lives. So, when she saw what Dan was building, she couldn’t help but be drawn to it. Together, they formed TRIBETIC in 2019, a name that resonates with their athletic spirit; the three metabolic levers of nutrition, exercise, and sleep; and a commitment to helping people with T1D. The duo believed they could revolutionize healthcare by optimizing the metabolic health of people with Type 1 diabetes, and the good people surrounding them are proof that they will. TRIBETIC’s advisory boards comprised accomplished endurance athletes and nutritional, genetic, behavioral, physiological, and metabolic experts who understand the intricacies of how the human body works. Currently, TRIBETIC is in the midst of a feasibility trial to refine their system and fundraising to develop the MVP. Ultimately, their goal is to make T1D management integrated, highly personalized, and accessible to all. TRIBETIC is a B2C platform whose approach to T1D management is rooted in personalization, integration, and interpretation. Personalization is at every step of a user’s journey with the app and live coaching. As soon as a user signs up, they will be asked to answer a few questions and engage in a brief discussion with an onboarding expert. This initial conversation is used to determine the best plans based on individual biology and lifestyle preferences. The next step is to connect daily activity trackers or CGMs with the app. TRIBETIC then gives users a personalized daily map. The map includes new plans for exercise, nutrition, and sleep every week and is adjustable based on the body’s response and schedule. All are supported by weekly calls encouraging compliance and persistence. TRIBETIC doesn’t just look at blood sugar levels but all aspects of metabolic health, including nutrition, sleep, exercise, and heart rate variability (HRV). By focusing on these areas, they simplify and take a holistic approach to T1D management. Interpretation is about providing users with information on why their blood sugar levels fluctuate in a specific instance and what particular lifestyle adjustments they can make to manage their condition better. TRIBETIC does this two different ways. First, they provide users with a metabolic health score that offers insights into their current state. Second, users are given access to expert coaches who guide them through their health journey. Initially, the weekly coaching calls are organized to provide personalized guidance and support. As the users progress and gain a deeper understanding of how their body responds to different factors, the level of human interaction gradually decreases, allowing for more automation. TRIBETIC is taking a holistic approach to the management of T1D, turning this daily challenge into a dynamic, engaging experience rather than a mundane chore. By infusing an athletic spirit and promoting self-empowerment, the venture is not just helping individuals manage their condition; they are helping them thrive, grow, and reclaim control over their lives. Lastly, the remarkable bond of trust Dan and Suzanne share, forged through shared experiences and recovery, lays the foundation for TRIBETIC’s resilience in the unpredictable world of startups. With each chapter, they’re determined to make the diabetes management landscape better, different, and truly special. Join us in welcoming Dan, Suzanne, and the TRIBETIC team to StartUp Health and to the T1D Moonshot community.

https://medium.com/startuphealth/bodimetrics-introduces-the-first-fda-cleared-pulse-ox-wearable-that-addresses-skin-pigmentation-a4665a499bba?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"“For decades, there was a known problem, and people swept it under the carpet. Covid just laid bare the long standing issue and related deaths in darker skinned individuals.” Neil Friedman is not a man to pull his punches, especially when it comes to healthcare inequity or injustice. Today he’s talking about what the New England Journal of Medicine called “the non-intended racial discrimination” of blood oxygen measurements using a pulse oximeter on people with darker skin tones. Pulse oximeters gauge blood oxygenation numbers by measuring the amount of oxygen in red blood cells using lights shined into the skin of the finger, so it makes sense that for over 40 years, doctors and researchers knew or should have known that fingertip pulse oximeters placed on darker pigmented skin may provide inaccurate readings. Based on pulse oximeter readings, doctors can diagnose various pulmonary diseases and determine treatments including whether a patient needs supplemental oxygen. Inaccurate blood oxygenation readings could mean patients aren’t maintaining the oxygen levels in their system to sustain their health and may not get the oxygen they need. A Harvard Medical School study in 2022 determined that Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients in intensive care units received less supplemental oxygen than Caucasian patients because of inaccurate pulse ox readings. With blood oxygen being one of the key metrics for triaging and treating patients with Covid, it’s little wonder that people of color suffered disproportionately poor outcomes — including death — during the pandemic. “During Covid, everyone ran to buy fingertip pulse oximeters or, here in NYC, minority populations were handed them by their doctors. The readings weren’t accurate,” says Friedman. “The healthcare community knew about the problem for years and didn’t do anything about it.” Friedman and his business partner Mark Goettling knew that patient monitoring, particularly when it came to blood oxygen, could be better, much better. When their company, BodiMetrics, looked to enter the remote patient monitoring (RPM) space, they took their time testing and validating the device they built to see if it could accurately monitor patient blood oxygen without a pigmentation problem. After years of experimentation and different mods, they figured out a solution that met their exacting standards and introduced CIRCUL Ring in 2019 and second-generation circul+ Smart Ring in 2021. The key, or what Friedman calls the “secret sauce,” lies in the patented form factor of the circul+ design. Worn on the finger like a ring, the device has spring loaded expandable sides to maintain a snug fit. This stabilizes the sensor because it can expand and contract with the patient’s movements and gives it the ability to provide medically accurate and actionable metrics. This stability and the fact that the light sensors lie on the palm side of the patient’s hand solves the issue of skin color, as the inside of the finger is lighter than the outside. “It’s a hospital on your finger, providing clinically valid data continuously every second via our patented form factor. This gives clinicians and patients alike the information needed to monitor and manage their chronic conditions and general wellbeing,” emphasizes Goettling. The BodiMetrics circul pro ring recently received FDA 510(k) Clearance and the Mayo Clinic just released a peer-reviewed study proving that the ring provides accurate blood oxygen measurements in all tones. This is a huge boon for the company, with Friedman describing the study as an earthquake in the industry. “Once that message is out there, every CEO of a healthcare system, an insurance company, etc. can’t hide from the fact that other measurement devices have a pigmentation problem that our device is clinically validated to solve.” Besides its proven effectiveness across different skin tones, the circul+ ring runs, well, circles around its competitors in terms of providing clinically relevant, actionable data. While other wearables take periodic measurements of blood oxygen levels during sleep (the Oura ring, for instance, measures every 15 minutes), only the circul+ provides measurements every second, making it the most accurate on the market. As sleep expert Meir Kryger from the Yale School of Medicine put it, “this is the only consumer device measuring and storing oxygen level heartbeat by heartbeat.” And sleep is a big deal when it comes to overall health. Just last year the American Heart Association added sleep to their checklist of essential components for optimal cardiovascular health. Poor quality of sleep contributes to problems with blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The circul+ ring quantifies its users sleep quality using multiple key performance indicators, like heart rate variability, temperature, oxygen desaturation, and sleep stages. BodiMetrics has a multi-year head start on their competitors in terms of crossing over from the fitness-focused wearables market to the medical world. They have three-year partnerships with both Kaiser Permanente and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition, they just signed an agreement with Carahsoft, a huge player in government and public sector and holder of government contracts. As a health solution, their target market is the chronically ill, those who are aging in place, rural communities, and anyone who is medically or geographically underserved. “Our device accurately measures more data than any other, and our mobile and cloud-based applications use AI and machine learning to contextualize that data for both the clinician and the patient to manage exercise, stress, sleep, and other important factors for health.” Besides their partnerships with providers like Kaiser and the VA, BodiMetrics sells products to consumers through wholesalers and retailers like Walmart and McKesson and directly to consumers via ecommerce from their own website, Amazon, and Sharper Image, and they have more retailers lined up. Although their eye is on the healthcare market, their product also appeals to the health conscious consumer who wants to accurately track their sleep and fitness metrics, a market that is expected to reach $612B by 2024. What the two founders love hearing the most, however, are the stories of real patients who received better care because of accurate readings. Just the other day, Friedman received a phone call from a physician in an ICU unit about a Black patient from whom they couldn’t get a good blood oxygen read. Then they used the circul+ ring, and it got the reading perfectly. Thanks to the tireless work of managing co-founders Neil Friedman and Mark Goettling, BodiMetrics’ real-time monitoring solution, circul+ Smart Ring and app, is extremely well-positioned in both the healthcare and consumer wearables market. As Friedman put it, “we are a great team.” Together they combine backgrounds as serial entrepreneurs in technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and distribution. The duo are backed by some of the most distinguished doctors in the sleep and pulmonary space as business advisors. We can’t wait to see how far they can go in the journey to provide next-level health metrics to patients and consumers. → Connect with BodiMetrics via email Are you a scientist or innovator focused on T1D innovation who would benefit from education about how to navigate and build a company that will be successful in attracting mission-aligned capital, customers, and collaborators to pursue scientific discoveries in the field of Type 1 diabetes?

https://medium.com/startuphealth/levicure-is-developing-a-breakthrough-triple-therapy-for-type-1-diabetes-b6c521e6b2c5?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"It’s been a hundred years since researchers discovered insulin, forever changing the lives of people living with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Since then, there’s been a steady flow of innovations in the diabetes space, refining the process of insulin monitoring and delivery modes so that patients get the insulin their bodies need. With insulin, the prognosis of T1D changed from an early death to a manageable chronic disease. At the end of the day, though, insulin is just that–something to manage the disease, not a cure. 100 years later, researchers are still looking for that magic bullet that will actually halt or reverse diabetes, with investors and pharmaceutical companies throwing massive amounts of money behind novel molecular and cell-based interventions. However, diabetes, like other autoimmune disorders, is incredibly complex, involving multiple pathological processes within the body. The likelihood a single molecule addresses the many systems at play is slim. That’s why diabetes researchers like Alex Rabinovitch, MD, PhD, have spent decades looking into compound drugs that tackle different disease mechanisms simultaneously. Dr. Rabinovitch specifically found that a combination of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and an enzyme inhibitor known as DPP-4i proved effective at restoring pancreatic beta cells, the cells that synthesize, store, and release insulin, which were safely and effectively used in the market for other indications. These results are a big deal, especially considering both drugs have well-established safety records, making the combination low risk. Unfortunately, the combination of the two drugs together was not enough to show significant improvement in a clinical trial. Shmuel Levit, MD, PhD, Head of Endocrinology and the Diabetes & Metabolism Institute at Assuta Medical Centers in Israel, knew all about Dr. Rabinovitch’s research into combination therapies. He was a big believer in their efficacy. Dr. Levit also closely followed the research around the efficacy of GABA, a neurotransmitter widely available as an over-the-counter supplement. In studies, GABA improved function of islet cells involved in producing insulin, delaying diabetes onset and helping restore normal blood glucose levels in animal models. Because of the established safety of PPI, DPP-4i, and GABA, Dr. Levit felt emboldened to take action: he suggested a course of treatment to his patients with T1D that combined all three elements. He expected this plan would reduce insulin demand. What he didn’t foresee or imagine was that some of his patients would get off insulin completely. Dr. Levit was flabbergasted. The triple combination promoted full remission for 70% of his patients that were newly diagnosed with T1D and significantly reduced insulin needs for his patients who’d lived with the disease for years. Ironically, without animal model studies and scientific peer-reviewed publications to back up what Dr. Levit saw with his patients, no one believed him. No one, that is, except Daniil Koshelev and Lucy Kosheleva, a husband and wife team with combined legal, research, and executive experience in the biotech space. They knew Dr. Levit through a personal connection–he treated and cured a close relative with a severe endocrine disorder–and they trusted his experience. Moreover, Dr. Levit’s discovery offered exactly what the Koshelevs were looking for–the chance to work on something big, something that could make a tremendous difference in patients’ lives around the world. Dr. Levit and the Koshelevs embarked on an unusual journey to prove the results Levit observed in his patients, working backwards from the typical cells-to-animal-to-patients model of new drug testing. With the support of Professor Helgi Schioth from Uppsala University and Dr. Rabinovitch, who came on board as a scientific advisor, a large study on NOD mice was conducted and published. This research confirmed that the synergistic effect of the triple combination was significantly superior to all double-combination results in a comprehensive animal model of T1D. This study was fundamental for successfully obtaining USA and European patents. To solidify Dr. Levit’s findings in his patients with T1D, the team together with Assuta Medical Centers received Helsinki’s approval to review existing medical records of treated individuals. It was important to unequivocally establish that patients had T1D and to carefully analyze all available data to establish the concrete therapeutic effect of the triple combination. The study was successfully published in a peer-reviewed journal and uncovered that 70% of people with T1D that were treated within 12 months of diagnosis experienced full insulin independence and a staggering C-peptide growth of 145%. While patients with long-term Type 1 diabetes also experienced improvement in glycemic control and decrease in exogenous insulin demand, it was really the early diagnosed group that showed such an unexpected result. The fact that all three components are considered extremely safe can substantially speed up the development process of bringing the novel combination to market. Just three years after hearing about Dr. Levit’s very promising patient results, the team has recently received positive and helpful feedback from the FDA and is ready to proceed directly to phase 2a clinical trials without needing to do any prior human or even animal safety studies. Levicure’s triple therapy is a proprietary combination drug entering phase 2 clinical development that will provide people with T1D a single tablet to facilitate remission, avoid T1D complications, and significantly improve their quality of life. Levicure combines safe and readily available drug components to create a scalable and affordable solution for the millions of people worldwide living with T1D. They have already successfully proved the concept with patients and received patents for their triple combination in US and Europe with additional IP protection in the form of exclusivities. “We see ourselves as taking the first step on the moon because so far there is no product for people diagnosed with T1D that can offer sustainable remission. This combination could be the first step on the long way towards curing the disease, which will also change the way others look at combination therapies for complex diseases,” Koshelev says. Besides the evidence that the Levicure triple combo therapy promotes full remission in adults recently diagnosed with T1D, its scalability and safety make the case for the product’s ability to penetrate the large diabetes market. Other diabetes solutions like cell therapies, transplants, stem cells, and immunotherapy come with high price tags, risks, scalability challenges, and high demands on a patient’s time and energy. Levicure aims to deliver a single tablet, taken once a day, to optimize compliance and adherence. Levicure is fundraising to finalize their phase 2 program and develop the final version of the triple combination drug. Assuming all goes well, they hope to bring their product to market as soon as 2029. To that end, they’ve assembled a stellar management team to guide them through the process, including Mike Teiler as their Chief Pharmaceutical Officer; Dr. Yafit Stark as their Head of Clinical Development; and Dr. Alexander Fleming, formerly responsible for diabetes therapies at FDA, T1D expert, and founder of Kinexum, serving as a regulatory advisor. It’s a difficult process, but the co-founders find overcoming the challenges part of the joy of their work. “This is the most challenging thing I’ve ever encountered. No one has ever conquered it,” Daniil says with the enthusiasm of a mountain climber. “Seeing Dr. Levit actually help his patients was the push moment for me,” adds Lucy. “He was brave enough not to stick to the book and bring this solution to people, and we want to get it out there for everyone else.” Levicure offers impressive results in a safe, scalable package, making it a diabetes intervention to watch. Because they repurpose and reformulate existing drugs to achieve these results, they can come to market much faster than novel molecules in development. With passionate founders at the helm, we see Levicure as having the grit and resources to shepherd their product to market, offering a viable path to remission for many people with diabetes.

https://medium.com/startuphealth/hireme-healthcare-is-fighting-the-nursing-shortage-with-a-better-matchmaking-experience-999aab8bf429?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"HireMe Healthcare would like the hiring process for nurses to feel a lot more like online dating. Ryan Lee, CEO & Co-founder, is full of romantic analogies for a process that many associate with drudgery. He describes the company as if Match.com and ZipRecruiter had a baby and he hopes the candidates using the site feel some reciprocity. “They control where the conversation goes,” Lee says, likening the process to the way Tinder pairs people and then opens a door for conversation. Here, chatting with a hiring manager is as easy as swiping left or right. HireMe Healthcare (HMH) grew out of a frustration with inefficiencies in healthcare hiring. Trey Ennis, Chairman & Co-founder, designed HMH after working in an operational role for a major healthcare system. He watched highly qualified candidates apply for positions and go nowhere because of staffing software with flawed algorithms that disqualified candidates for minor reasons, like not having the right keywords in their resumes. Meanwhile, the hiring managers working with Ennis were desperate to find employees as nurse-to-patient ratios began declining to dangerous levels. The nurse staffing crisis is a national problem. HireMe Healthcare points to a 17% national RN vacancy rate in 2022; 81% of hospitals are struggling with RN vacancy rates of 10% or higher. According to their numbers, Covid exacerbated the nursing shortage — a period in which agencies dramatically increased the hourly rate for travel nurses. “It has really thrown this industry into a bit of a tailspin,” says Lee. Hospitals were often forced to pay inflated rates for travel nurses, adding to their existing financial woes from staffing vacancies and high turnover rates among nurses. Presently, 83% of hospitals are now operating in negative margins. “We’re watching critical access hospitals shut down,” says Lee. Lee thinks that the solutions to these staffing problems are inadequate. “It’s a full-time job just applying to these jobs,” says Lee. Applicants are required to input their resume into a different system each time they apply to a job. “It’s utter madness,” he says, adding that “there currently isn’t a space for the human aspect of the process.” He hopes that HireMe Healthcare will function like a one-stop shop for nurses seeking employment and a more trustworthy, efficient resource for employers trying to fill vacancies. And he wants the process to feel good for all parties, even if sparks aren’t flying at the same velocity as they may on Tinder or Match.com. After Ennis’s first-hand observations of staffing inefficiencies, he began building HireMe Healthcare by creating a beta app, testing the concept, and conducting market research. He soon started gathering a team to help realize his vision. One of Ennis’s first phone calls was to Lee, a childhood friend from Charlotte, North Carolina. “I went to an investor meeting with him and I walked away as a co-founder,” says Lee, who has a background practicing entrepreneurial law and a master’s degree in human rights. Lee was enthusiastic about the viability of the business from a logistics standpoint. “Anyone can have a good idea and Trey has brilliant ideas but this could be carried out logistically,” says Lee. Ennis, like Lee, felt an affinity with the healthcare industry as many of his family and friends work in the field and he saw the opportunity as a pathway toward his lifelong dream of creating a startup in the humanitarian space. “Figuring out how to improve access to healthcare in my own homeland, beforehand, was an opportunity I wanted to be a part of,” says Lee. The platform is an online marketplace and career development resource, designed to supply healthcare providers with nurses that are high-quality, local, and permanent. The intake process for nurses is “quick and one time.” Once in the system, nurses are able to search for jobs in an interface that looks a lot like Zillow, with jobs displayed geographically. Hiring managers are encouraged to bolster their jobs with tailored descriptions about their workplaces and if a match looks enticing, HMH’s app and messaging function allows for easy communication between hiring managers and job seekers. HireMe Healthcare boasts of their proprietary technology — a precision staffing algorithm which allows for better results than the blunt software tools Ennis encountered while working in the healthcare industry. “Our algorithm scores candidates based on job descriptions with every aspect of the description bifurcated into whether it’s required or desired,” says Lee. Candidates are then ranked for best fit according to listed positions. Once a candidate is placed, HMH earns a placement fee or larger facilities can choose to pay for the service through a monthly subscription-based fee. In order to build candidate profiles, HMH doesn’t merely rely on data from one’s resume, which Lee describes as “an outdated document.” “We’re working to make the hiring process a human experience by considering factors beyond what the resume holds,” says Lee. These factors — the qualitative, intangible qualities of a person — can make the difference between a decent fit and a great fit and identify candidates that might best complement the culture of a hospital or community. Lee and his colleagues at HMH are experimenting with pickup lines to ask candidates. Lee has a favorite: What are you most passionate about in life? “You can gain a lot from a person by asking them this,” he says. He hopes that answers to questions like these put a more human face to their candidates. While speaking with healthcare professionals about HireMe Healthcare, Lee encountered an orthopedic surgeon who said if he had access to this technology and could keep up with staff needs, he would be able to nearly double his output and complete up to 15 surgeries a day. A hospital fully staffed with capable nurses results in a workplace where other staff — like the orthopedic surgeon — can work to their potential. It’s also a win for patient care and the financial health of hospitals. For nurses seeking the right placement, HMH simplifies an arcane and frustrating process. With the staffing needs of healthcare facilities in crisis mode, we are enthusiastic about standing behind HireMe Healthcare. It’s a smart platform to make things easier and more efficient for job seekers and employers alike. We’re looking forward to seeing some of their matches yield long-term commitments — and transforming healthcare hiring along the way.

I am also a Professor of Religion with a Master of Divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary and a Ph.D. from Yale University. My area of training is biblical studies and social history of the early Jesus movement. As a biblical scholar, I spend quite a bit of time reading the Bible. I don’t read the Bible because I’m a biblical scholar. I’m a biblical scholar because I enjoy reading the Bible. I have taught “Introduction to Biblical Studies” to undergraduate college students since 2001. I teach in the religion department of a small liberal arts college associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA). While the college has a “religion” general education requirement that all students must satisfy, the religion department is a “religion” department that promotes “religious studies” rather than a “Christianity” department that promotes “Christian studies.” Recent comments made by the newly elected U.S. Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, remind me of comments I often hear from undergraduate students who claim to be “Bible-believing” Christians. Johnson said in a recent interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News that the best way to learn how he feels about “any issue under the sun” is to read the Bible. In the interview, Johnson states, "

As you might imagine, I received much feedback, including one comment that made me pause. Some realities fuel the Great Replacement Theory, including the fact the white population is shrinking by percentage and by number. Census projections are that white people will become a minority in America by 2045, so in terms of actual numbers, white people are being replaced. Depending on where they get their news, some white people are being bombarded with messages saying they are victims of reverse discrimination. Brown people are streaming across the Southern border and being handed voter registration cards, and affirmative action is depriving white and Asian students of opportunity, though the most significant beneficiaries were white women. What is lacking, in reality, is white certainty. It used to be the case that if you came from a well-off white family and got an education, you had a reasonable expectation of success. You could inherit the family business or depend on nepotism and relationships to advance your career. Your main competition was from your peer group because minorities were systemically provided fewer opportunities… "

Her post responded to someone who asked folks to brag about something they accomplished this year. In the photo, you can see her holding all four degrees, wearing her cap and gown, and a warm smile. Sadly, some of the responses were anything but congratulatory. And as a Black woman with three degrees in Psychology, pursuing her fourth, a Ph.D., I felt it was appropriate, if not necessary, to raise my voice and ask a question on behalf of the black scholarly community — since when are academic accomplishments a bad thing? If you’re a Black woman with a degree, you’ve likely heard many people condemn you for your academic rigor. For instance, when dating someone years ago and answering a question about my experience in college, I was told firmly, “College is not for everybody.” On the surface level, this is a normal, benign statement. After all, there are many trades that people can acquire. One of my grandfathers was a sharecropper and carpenter, while the other obtained a Master’s in Mathematics. And while one of my grandmothers was a homemaker, the other earned a Master’s in Education. Many people acquire trades, and no one could argue against the fact that “college is not for everybody,” however, when this is said in response to someone describing their experience, it feels diminishing. That would be like someone telling me how proud they are for becoming a mechanic and me responding, “Well, being a mechanic is not for everybody.” Black academics are often accused of punching down those who did not attend college when sharing their knowledge or expertise.

While researching and writing that article, I came across the term “No Humans Involved” (NHI). The term “No Humans Involved” (NHI) was the unofficial term used by members of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and other public officials to describe the murders of people of color and those in other communities deemed “nonhuman.” The murders disproportionately involved Black and Brown Angelenos, who were often identified as sex workers, gang members, or drug traffickers. The use of the term came to light in 1992 following the arrest and acquittal of four LAPD officers caught on video brutally beating Rodney King. In 1992, the Jamaican scholar and theorist Sylvia Wynter penned a seminal text titled “‘No Humans Involved’: An Open Letter to My Colleagues.” In her letter, Wynter argued that academia was partly to blame for the Rodney King beating and its aftermath because academic institutions uphold and disseminate problematic constructs of race, gender, class, sexuality, and other categories that continue to overdetermine our lived experiences and justify or deny our humanity. Wynter asserted that the dehumanization of young, unemployed, Black males allowed them to be subjected to the “genocidal effects [of] incarceration and elimination . . . by ostensibly normal, and everyday means.” While the term was first associated with encounters between law enforcement and Black Americans, it has been used concerning other marginalized groups as well. NHI has been… "

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing.

Studies have found this territory contains 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.7 billion barrels of oil. All of this is worth around $524 billion! However, as Donald points out, the UN report questions Israel’s “national right” to these resources and argues they should be shared among local parties, especially as most of these reserves are in formally Palestinian-held territory, which Israel has occupied under deeply questionable means. Despite this, Israel has for decades been the only nation profiting off of the regional gas and oil fields it effectively stole from Palestine. They even refuse to supply Palestine with natural gas or let them extract it, as Israel is worried it would fund terrorism. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Like the open-air concentration camps, the massive military presence and apartheid state Israel… "

As my Silent Generation (the generation older than the Baby Boomers; there are about 20 million of them in America) mother is still alive, I used to get a good chuckle at those stories as I thought, “Pretty wishful thinking, there, everyone, I’m pretty sure most of the Baby Boomers are still going to be alive twenty (if not thirty) years from now.” And the retirement and long-term care years of the Baby Boomers? Those are going to be long and expensive years. This subject has slipped my mind of late, but recently I heard a story on the radio program Marketplace that covered this very truth. In the story, the reporter talked about her spouse’s grandmother Sue, whose spouse died when she was in her late 80s. As a consequence, her grandson (the reporter’s spouse) had to take over doing her finances and helping her. In return, the grandmother pledged that he would inherit everything when she died. When the grandmother did die, more than a decade later, she only had two thousand dollars left to leave to the grandson. Not many people would do a job (and often a worrying and stressful job like helping an older person figure out finances and costs and long-term care) for a solid decade if they thought they would net two thousand dollars. The hourly pay rate would be measured in pennies. The journalist further pointed that their family was lucky — the grandmother was a fiscally responsible person who had saved a lot of money for her retirement and nursing needs, so the grandson and his family were not responsible for paying for her care out of pocket. (Which is a very real possibility for some families.) All of this is not to say that the only reason we ever take care of people is because we are paid to do so.

With 36% of humanity eating pigs, it's the most widely consumed meat on the planet. Yet, almost a third of the world’s population doesn’t eat pork. The reason behind not eating pork is often a religious taboo. Pork is forbidden in Islam and Judaism. Many Christian sects, such as the Seventh-Day Adventists, abstain from eating pig meat. Pork is not popular among Hindus, although there is no official religious restriction. Have you ever wondered why Judaism and Islam prohibit pork? Many foods are forbidden in the two religions, yet several of their followers don’t practice them. But why do Muslims and Jews follow religious guidelines on pork? Scholars researching the pork taboo provide several theories about its origins. We’ll analyze some of the more popular to determine the best possible explanations. But, before we get into the reasons behind the ban, let’s go over what archaeologists Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish refer to as “pig principles.” The “pig principles” are a set of observations about pigs that will serve as a groundwork for understanding the origins of the pork taboo. The scholars have proposed several principles. We‘ll talk about the most relevant ones. Since the Paleolithic era, humans have hunted wild boar. Carvings at the Göbekli Tepe reflect the familiarity with boars. Around 10,000 BC, we domesticated the wild boar as the pig. Hesse and Wapnish outlined the following “pig principles” based on their research of archeological data and historical records spanning thousands of years in the Near East: "

After all, most of us who experienced the period are getting on in life. Millennials are now closing in on their 40s, and the kids from Gen-Z are also years into adulthood. At the same time, it’s never been easier to reach into the past, and paradoxically, the past has never seemed so far removed from the digital present. People have long surmised that as we grow older, we crave simpler times. Nostalgia is a complex thing, though. Sometimes it’s not so much what we had before that we miss, but the things we never had. Likewise, sometimes it’s not so much that past we crave, but the futures that never came to be. On other occasions, nostalgia catches us off guard as we realize that something once so omnipresent in our lives has vanished like an old friend you lost touch with years ago. In a roundabout way, this brings me to Frutiger Aero, an aesthetic that emerged in the early-to-mid 2000s and, for nearly a decade, encapsulated so many of the design choices of the era before silently disappearing. Now, if you’re wondering how you managed to live through the 2000s and the early 2010s and never hear the phrase ‘Frutiger Aero,’ it’s because it didn’t exist back then. It was only years later that Sofi Lee, a member of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute (CARI), coined the phrase. She named the aesthetic after two hallmarks of the style, the Frutiger family of fonts (created by Adrian Frutiger) and Windows Aero, the design language of the Windows Vista operating system. But what does Frutiger Aero actually look like? It’s not the easiest to summarize, but hallmarks of the aesthetic include: "

Rents were surging past $2,000 a month. Without paying anything toward food, regular bills, or basic survival a cool $36,000 a year would go poof, just like that. My apartment in Tucson, Arizona, decided to increase rent by nearly 40%, in the middle of a pandemic, and I knew I couldn’t swing that unless I started to swing from stripper poles on a self-minted OnlyFans page. But after some research, it seemed like the demand for pale, mid-30-year-olds with an average body and less than stellar hairline wasn’t all that high. So I needed an alternative. I searched for the most affordable rental cities in the country. Places very literally in the middle of nowhere Kansas and Iowa and West Virginia. Prices were better, but not to the point where I could actually begin to pay things down. I searched out shipper container homes. If I could buy a slice of land, again in the middle of nowhere, and slowly build out a house made from shipping containers. The ones from China formerly used to move industrial waste were somewhat affordable. But I didn’t trust myself cutting out windows in metal walls, and the possibility of developing cancer from the containers didn’t sit all that well either.

Otherwise I won’t do it, I’ll get too overwhelmed by the bigness of it and freeze”. My mind flashed to the 100 unfinished projects already sitting on my studio floor. “I will draw for 100 days in a row. But it only has to be on the size of a post-it note.

Inhabiting nearly every corner of the globe, these highly adapted creatures can hunt all manner of animals during all times of the day, collectively consume around the same amount of meat as a developed country, and annually claim the lives of more than 300 million native prey in Australia alone. It’s a serious pest and is arguably second only to humans in its ability to hamper biodiversity levels. I am, of course, talking about roaming domestic cats. Cats have long ruled the world. Wherever we’ve gone, they’ve ultimately followed and been suitably worshipped by all who’ve come across them. In ancient times, we built statues of them, wrote literature in their honor, ingrained them into our mythologies, and even took them along on war campaigns. Today, we use what is arguably our greatest invention — the internet — mostly to share pictures and videos of them online. Speaking as a cat owner, I think cats are great.

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

I started writing this on October 7th, and I’ve been writing it ever since. Even though this awful war is not about you (Western, mainly White leftists), I’ve been finding myself having full conversations with you in my head. I tried to tell myself it doesn’t matter what you think, to focus on myself, on the people impacted, on what I believe in. But here I am, spending my energy on you. Because I’m surrounded by you and it overwhelms me. This might not be worded perfectly, I might ramble or not make sense. We’re on day 19 of hell, so we do what we can. This is not the most urgent thing to talk about right now, I know that. As I write this, there are still over 200 people held hostage by Hamas, civilians, mothers, babies, elderly. There are thousands dead in Gaza, hundreds of funerals in Israel and so many bodies still not identified. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing so quickly. Like I said, day 19 of hell. 19 straight days of the most horrific accounts, pictures, and videos I’ve ever seen, that I truly wish I could unsee and un-know. The images of babies in Gaza buried under rubble, of babies in Israel burnt alive, of old women taken hostage, of mothers trying to protect their families with their own bodies. I feel these images rattling inside me, all sharp edges, leaving their marks. I can’t look at a child without being reminded. I can’t look at my own grandma without being reminded. This is all we can think about. So it bears repeating: release the hostages, declare a ceasefire, help the survivors, start working towards a real, long term solution. Even though we have so many awful, urgent things happening all around us, I’m still writing this now. Writing is how I make sense of things and I need to make sense of the difficult feelings so many of us on the Israeli left have been experiencing in the last two weeks. These awful two weeks that feel like one long awful day. I’m writing this out of immense pain and grief, from my own perspective as an anti-occupation Israeli, to try and explain a bit what this has been like for me, for us. I want to note that this is not for those of you who celebrated what happened on October 7th. If you felt any joy in your heart about hundreds of civilians getting slaughtered in their beds, about children getting executed in front of their parents, about grandparents sacrificing themselves to save their grandkids, about horrors that I can’t even handle describing— I truly have nothing to say to you. Whatever is wrong with you is too deep and I want nothing to do with it until you figure that out. This is for those of you who know that what happened is, at the very least, sad. For those who treated this absolute nightmare as an unfortunate situation that we had coming. For those who didn’t celebrate but instead stayed silent. Who were so quick to lecture us about context and resistance from the comfort of your homes. Those who were so eager to share hot takes calling us losers who don’t understand decolonization while terrorists were still hunting down survivors to finish the job. While we were still searching through snuff videos of the massacre Hamas posted online, looking for signs of life or death from loved ones. Those who had the posts locked and loaded, ready to show us just how progressive and radical you are. This is for you. What really shocked me is how quick you were to know what’s right. On that awful Saturday, while little kids were still hiding in closets and under beds next to their parents’ dead bodies, before we even started counting our dead, you already knew what’s right. You already told us. You, who never faced such horrors and who couldn’t even imagine them, who never felt or will feel such real, immediate fear for your family and your people, you were ready with your posts telling us about privilege and the price of revolutions. And I can’t stop asking myself where you got the nerve. How you dared to sit comfortably in your home and casually post your little tweets and memes about how acceptable it is to slaughter us, in between your posts about brunch and your dog and your friend’s birthday? How dare you lecture us on how we should have reacted? What kind of subversive activism do you think you’re a part of when you’re being so careful not to express any understanding towards our grief? What do you think you’re fighting for? Sometimes I think some of us on the left have become so focused on pointing out what we perceive as subversive, as not obvious, that we fail to see the most simple and obvious of things. That we’ve gotten so used to this oppositional standpoint that we find ourselves so far removed from the values that are supposed to be at our core. Values of humanity, solidarity, justice, peace. How did we find ourselves condoning (if by silence, omission, doubt, or something worse) the cold blooded, planned, systematic murder of children, women, entire families? I don’t know exactly where we took a wrong turn but I’m praying we find our way back. There is obviously the personal hurt here. We’re going through unimaginable amounts of grief, and even in the worst of it, you couldn’t spare us a hint of kindness. You were so committed to finding and aligning yourself with the party line that you couldn’t show us an inch of humanity. So careful not to commit the awful sin of supporting the evil colonizers, of humanizing the enemy, of normalizing our existence. So careful that you could not allow yourself to acknowledge our pain, even if you’ve known us for years. So yes, there is personal hurt. A lot of it. It’s really hard having your friends turn on you, chastise you, doubt you, or just completely ignore you when you’re going through the worst nightmare you could imagine. You’ve compounded our grief, and taken away from your own humanity by doing so. That is for you to figure out now. There is also a bigger hurt here. The damage we could see you making to what activists in the region have been working towards for so long. On October 7th you were gleefully explaining justice to us, but we on the Israeli left already knew what awaited us and the people of Gaza. We knew hell was about to be unleashed on them and that nothing inspiring, revolutionary, or progressive was about to happen. We knew that Palestinian civilians were about to pay for what Hamas did, and that so much more grief was just around the corner. While you lectured us about decolonization, we were already grieving the children of Gaza. You played right into the hands of the most right-wing, fascist Israeli voices. Those who have been telling us that no one cares about our lives, that Palestinians would slaughter us like animals if given the chance, that our friends on the left would celebrate it. That our activism and anti-occupation work will not save us. You have made it so incredibly hard for us to explain that this is not what we’re fighting for. That this isn’t what Palestinians want for us. That this is not a price anyone should ever ever have to pay. Palestinians directly affected by this showed us grace during this awful time, knowing that our fates are tied together, while you chose to tell us that this is just how the cookie crumbles. You, who did not witness the horrors that we’re trying to stop, closed your hearts to us quicker than many of our Palestinian friends, who were the ones actually experiencing them. People who lost so much have shown more humanity to the “other side” than you even dared to entertain. What excuse do you have? We didn’t ask you to wave an Israeli flag. We didn’t ask you to say this is just as bad as what’s happened in Gaza. We just asked you for basic human sympathy, we asked you to say this is unacceptable. We asked you to let us grieve and to grieve with us, just as we will continue to grieve with the people of Gaza. It shouldn’t be this hard for you. It cannot be this hard for you. Yes, we know you think this is a narrative that gets enough attention. That politicians and the media have already condemned it and you don’t want to join them in their “we stand with Israel” parade. We know you think it’s been repeated so much it doesn’t even matter anymore. But you know what — it matters to us, and we’re going to need to hear it from you. You are supposed to be the ones who care about justice, our allies in this fight, not the media and the politicians. If this is the vision you have for liberation then we never have been and never will be allies. I’m at a loss at what some of you think Israeli anti-occupation activists should do. Is the right thing to accept any act of violence as legitimate, as long as it’s done in the name of decolonization? Is it for us to get down on our knees with our hands up and let ourselves be raped and murdered for freedom? Is it to let our families be slaughtered and say nothing other than “any act of resistance against an oppressor is legitimate”? Maybe you will be kind enough to allow us to grieve. Obviously quietly, privately, lest we push the wrong narrative. Or maybe we just need to go back to where we came from? To truly decolonize all of Palestine? Should we go back to Poland, to Iraq, Germany, Russia, Yemen, or would you like to host us at your place? The Zionist project is not something I ever celebrated, but you need to understand that unlike many of your colonial ancestors, we did not come to Palestine out of some imperial dream. We didn’t come to conquer or even to find a better life. We came as refugees. As survivors of pogroms and the Farhud and forced displacement and yes, the Holocaust. We know, we’ve said many times, the Holocaust wasn’t the Palestinians’ fault. It doesn’t justify the occupation or excuse any of the atrocities committed by the Israeli government. But it does provide that thing you crave— context. It does mean that we have nowhere else to go. It means that Israelis and Palestinians will continue to live and die together on this small piece of land. This is it for us. I know you’re tired of hearing about the Holocaust. It’s ancient history. An excuse we cynically use to justify everything the Israeli government does. You think we have to let it go, because we’re not those same poor sad Jews anymore, now we’re the bad guys, with our strong army that protects us from everything (well). But sometimes I remember that Anne Frank was born 6 months after my grandma. My 94-year-old grandma, who still tries to make it in time to the bomb shelter at her assisted living facility, every time there’s a siren (she fails most of the time, she moves rather slowly). This is the context we’re working with, the fear that’s burnt into our DNA by centuries of persecution. A fear that, despite knowing our history, I never felt quite as strongly as I did on October 7th. A fear I tried to push aside because I believe it takes courage, trust, and faith to work towards real peace instead of towards war. It takes believing your allies and those you seek to make peace with can see your humanity. This is that fascist talking point — we need to be able to defend ourselves, at all costs. Pity will not help us, being moral will not help us, we need to survive. If our lives are fair game in this thing you so happily called resistance, decolonization, freedom, then where the hell does that leave us? If you won’t speak up for even the most vulnerable and innocent of us, our babies and our elderly, then what choice do you leave Israelis with any sense of self preservation other than to continue to live by our sword? Other than understanding that our lives are worthless to the world, with no one but ourselves to count on? Israeli activists have been advocating for decades that our future, our safety, our freedom, is tied with that of the Palestinians. That it’s not a zero sum game — it’s the opposite. That we live together or die together. That it’s not us against them — it’s war mongers and corrupt politicians against the rest of us. Against the people. Us killing and hating each other won’t make us safer or better off. It only bolsters our most power-hungry leaders. We’re trying to maintain our humanity in the face of the most brutal and cruel attack on our people since the Holocaust. In the face of horrors so awful that I have to actively push them out of my mind because I know I will buckle under their weight. We’re trying to remind ourselves and each other that all life is sacred, that our freedoms aren’t mutually exclusive, that, quite simply, killing innocent people is wrong. We shouldn’t have to remind you as well. Israeli anti-Zionist activists have been working endlessly, side by side with Palestinians, against the occupation. Some of us have dedicated our lives to it, all of us have paid a price for it. You are a guest in this struggle and your position on it has cost you nothing. You have sacrificed nothing. You can do it comfortably and without consequence, and the result of it will not impact your life or safety. Israel and Palestine could both disappear off the face of the earth in a cloud of blood and smoke, and your life will remain almost unchanged. You might lose a couple of friends, post about it on Instagram for a week or so, and have some awkward office conversation. Then your life will go on. But our lives and those of our families and communities depend on the consequences of this struggle. We don’t expect praise or thanks for our work against the occupation and we truly don’t do any of this for you, but we do expect basic human empathy. Yes, we know Palestinians don’t get basic human empathy from so many people, we know they’re not heard. This is what we’re fighting for. But we will not erase ourselves and our families in the process, because, like I’ve said, all of us maintaining our humanity in this struggle is simply not negotiable. We definitely won’t negotiate it with you. Your aspirations of decolonization are theories. They’re something you would never have to face yourself. You’ll never be the collateral damage in this kind of freedom fighting, you’ll never have to pay a price for it. Your family will never be slaughtered at the altar of anti-colonialism, yet you’re willing to sacrifice our families. You’ll never be told to leave your home and go back to wherever you came from (even though you were born there). Your history of colonialism is old enough, your history of genocide effective enough, that you and your family and everyone you love can continue to be safe and comfortable while you preach about armed resistance. I’m sure you wouldn’t dare criticize any violent act of decolonization acted upon you, but we’ll never truly know. I wouldn’t wish it upon you that we’ll ever find out. My heart breaks over and over as I see us trying to garner a shred of empathy from you. As we wave the pictures of our dead, the nightmarish stories of our survivors (that you were so quick to doubt and disregard), the horror videos of torture and murder that we will never be able to forget. As we plead and beg for you to care about the 200 people held hostage. We disrespect ourselves and our dead in this desperate attempt to shake you, to make you believe us. People in Israel and Palestine are being pitted against each other with our suffering. Forced to fight to show you the greatest horrors, the most death, the worst cruelty. Trying to win this made-up competition which only has losers. Each trying to scream at those on the other side who closed their hearts and minds to us: why can’t you see us? How could you justify this? Don’t you see we don’t deserve this? So we will swallow the pain you’ve caused us. Because, again, this isn’t about you. We’re not going to let you antagonize us from our own fight for justice. You won’t make us choose between our life and safety and the life and safety of the people in Gaza, or anywhere else in Israel or Palestine. We know that peace and justice are possible, we will be safe, and Palestinians will be safe. We will find a way, together. We have no other choice. Lastly, I want to share the ending of the poem Red Sea by Aurora Levins Morales. I’ve been finding myself repeating it in my head like a mantra. I recommend it. And a final tiny note: to the friends and allies who have managed to maintain their humanity and hold the complexity and the absolute horror of this situation with us — we cannot thank you enough. Thank you for caring, thank you for treating us with decency and patience. Thank you for looking beyond the slogans. Thank you for seeing that we’re just humans on both sides of this. Thank you for believing that we all deserve better. "

As it stands, Israel is on a path to a theocracy which is an unintended consequence of traditional and secular Jews believing they could ultimately control their tribal cousins. Similar dynamics in geopolitics are in play in many parts of the Europe. Israel just makes it easier to notice, but harder to talk about openly in a world where secular people still believe they can sweep these problems under a rug. (The U.S. also had this problem, but between the formerly middle-class and the economic elites). Okay. Don’t burst a blood vessel, but an argument could be made that both the Haredi and Hamas need to be wiped out to maintain a democratic Israel. In a winner take all, if the 1.3 million Haredi (ultra-orthodox Jews) battled Hamas and the surrounding 2 million Arabs in Gaza who would win? Answer, the Haredi Jews seldom take part in Israel’s Defense Forces so Hamas would win. If the 3.5 million secular Jews of Israel battled Gaza who would win? (Let’s assume Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the West Bank sit it out). Answer, the secular Jews would ultimately win but the number of casualties on both sides would be greater than the recent growth in ultra-orthodox and Zionist populations in Israel. In other words, secular Jews would leave Israel with a greater population of hard-right Jews, whether you count them as Orthodox or Zionist. Demographics is destiny, after all. You want to know why Israel didn’t go hard-charging in Gaza immediately. I bet that problem is lurking in everyone’s mind in the IDF. The problem of secular Jews losing control of Israel is easily visible in Israel’s inability to form a stable government in the past few years. If all Jews in Israel moved to a new territory in Africa (an idea floated in early Zionist days), would they be better off than if they stay where they are? That’s just one of those academic questions to allow your blood pressure to return to normal. When a secular Israeli dies battling Hamas in Gaza, should Haredi Jews read one… "

However, the reality that these measures are having little impact has been highlighted by the appearance of the Huawei Mate P60 Pro, which was quietly launched online for the Chinese market and coinciding — probably not by chance — with the visit to Beijing of the US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo. Huawei’s new smartphone is based on a seven-nanometer microprocessor, something it was thought Chinese manufacturers could not manage. It is not the expected Hi-Silicon chip, but a newly engineered one manufactured by SMIC. Nanometers represent how finely a microprocessor’s silicon sheets can be layered: the thinner they are, the greater the possibility of packing in more components, resulting in a more powerful processor. Extremely high-precision machines are needed to make such slim microprocessors, using components sourced from various industries in different countries around the world. By imposing a blockade on China that also extended to its own trading partners, the United States wanted to slow down its rival’s technological development, something that affects everything that contains chips: from consumer electronics to automobiles to weapons. The unveiling of the Huawei Mate P60 Pro shows that Chinese industry is able to keep moving forward despite Washington’s best efforts to stymie it. But let’s go further… “despite” or “thanks” to those efforts? What happens when you try to corner an industry with obvious development capabilities? Quite simply, the whole country, from the government down to the most minor engineers, sees it as a challenge, and tries to overcome it. What used to be purchased abroad must now be manufactured within the country’s borders, and this may end up resulting, paradoxically, in greater competitiveness. In fact, the Chinese media has framed its reporting of the launch of Huawei Mate P60 Pro as proof that the trade war is not working. "

The study’s conclusions are hardly surprising, but which someone had to provide concrete data for, and that’s what we academics are for: the introduction of the ChatGPT generative algorithm a year ago has had significant negative effects on creative professions such as graphic designers and copywriters. Using data from copywriters and graphic designers on the freelancing platform Upwork, the researchers found that these professionals not only experienced a significant drop in the number of jobs they could bid for, but even steeper drops in earnings, suggesting not only that generative AI is taking away their jobs, but that it tends to devalue the dwindling volume of work they still do. The case of copywriters and graphic designers is particularly interesting because it illustrates the phenomenon of direct substitution: the work that someone used to request from one of these professionals, even considering the possible iterations until a satisfactory result was obtained, can now be carried out directly by the generative algorithm. The results are significant and amount to around 2% in the number of jobs obtained monthly, and 5.2% in monthly income from the time ChatGPT was released. Moreover, workers who previously typically earned the highest incomes and who completed a greater number of jobs do not result in a lower likelihood of seeing their employment and income decline, but even worse outcomes, implying that having more skills is no protection against job or income loss. These results suggest that, in the short term, generative AI reduces the overall demand for knowledge workers of all types, and may also have the potential to reduce gaps between workers. As time goes on, we will undoubtedly see more academic work trying to quantify the effect of the emergence of generative algorithms. Their widespread adoption following the launch of ChatGPT over the last 12 monthsprovides a discontinuity in time that makes it easy to quantify the effects on individual practitioners. Moving from the realm of untested hypotheses to concrete and specific quantification and proving that there are indeed significant effects on society is a first step towards making predictions about different industries and labor markets, and may well affect the regulation of the use of such tools in the future.

The idea is to launch two new subscription tiers, one below the current eight dollars a month for X Premium, with all the features but with ads, and another more expensive one, without ads. X also wants users to pay a small fee, one dollar a year, which will allow them to carry out all the usual actions, from posting content to “liking”, reposting, replying, bookmarking or quoting posts, while users who do not pay this amount will get a read-only account that will only be used to view posts and follow accounts. This scheme, which has been in testing in New Zealand and the Philippines for a few days now, is part of the company’s plan to reduce the number of fake accounts created on bot factories, thereby reducing some of the non-genuine activity. In addition, the company is paying content creators who are signed up to its premium service based on the popularity of their updates and the revenue they generate in ads or subscriptions, something it already started doing a few months ago in selected markets. The big question, of course, is to what extent requiring a subscription fee will stop bot factories. Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress and its highly successful Akismet anti-spam extension, knows about this from personal experience: he’s just published a brief note saying that Musk’s proposals seem like a good idea and definitely introduces a proof of work. The history of the web seems to affirm that these kinds of disincentives are not enough to prevent spam. According to Mullenweg, the incentive to manipulate X is such that those with a vested interest to do so will spend any amount of money, as is the case with other variations of spam where spammers purchase, for example, domain names that cost more than a dollar a year, and simply hope that the revenue they make from their activity will be enough to compensate them. Spam is a billion-dollar industry that attracts significant capital investments. In the case of activity aimed at election manipulation, the potential benefit from changing a government or destabilizing a country is so great as to outweigh the need… "

Alex is the head of technology strategy, development and execution, and is the most visible face of the project, given that Sam Altmann is engaged in many more projects, notably OpenA, and that Max Novendstern left WorldCoin last year to develop other related projects, although he remains as an advisor. Our conversation revolved around the challenges of the controversial biometric identity project, principally its commitment to privacy — as it says on its website: “Worldcoin doesn’t want to know who you are, just that you’re unique.” Acquiring a Worldcoin digital identity involves having one’s iris scanned, from which a fragment of the reading is recorded and given a unique hash or iris code that cannot be used to identify the person, and is instead used to demonstrate their uniqueness. The method has polarized opinion, but has been supported by many leading figures involved in cryptocurrencies, among them Vitalik Buterin, while some state agencies dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and rights of citizens have already given it their approval. To understand this issue, one has to bear in mind the potential problems that the development of a technology like generative AI will bring in a very short time. AI bots of all types already being developed by companies like Meta and many others will allow us to go beyond deepfakes to create synthetic social networks made up of thousands of profiles in the form of citizens of a given country that can act in a coordinated and organized way to simulate opinions and social trends of any kind, intermingled with genuine people. All this is a huge threat to democracy, creating a playground for anyone seeking to manipulate participation. Identification systems that make it possible to ensure that someone is indeed human, but without the need to reveal their name or personal data, has huge potential, hence Worldcoin’s plan is not simply to offer a cryptocurrency such as WLD and propose it as the basis for systems based on… "

In other words, “do the math”. Generative algorithms are costly, requiring the development of models with billions of variables: until very recently, even the most sophisticated machine learning automation models had barely a few hundred. But companies could offset development costs against their long-term amortization, finding patient venture capitalists willing to wait for the maturation of the investment. The problem arises with models whose training cannot be stopped and require constant iterations to generate new, more advanced versions that take into account a constantly changing context. At the same time, they face very high operating costs, which generate constant negative cash flows. If training costs are already high, inference costs far exceed the scale of the previous ones, and grow even more as the model gets larger. ChatGPT costs more than $700,000 a day to run: every time someone asks it a question, the company loses money, either because it’s a free user, or because it is a paying user getting their money’s worth. Finding a price that would allow a balance with respect to the costs it generates would surely mean that very few people would be able to use it on a daily basis. Even with its growth in turnover, charging $20 a month to premium users, the company is far from covering its costs. Due to its myriad and mounting costs ChatGPT has been described as a pact with the devil. An analysis of the costs of running large language models (LLMs) shows that running them is simply not financially viable, and helps understand why Google, at the beginning of this arms race to have the best generative algorithm, hesitated before joining in.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads.

Studies have found this territory contains 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.7 billion barrels of oil. All of this is worth around $524 billion! However, as Donald points out, the UN report questions Israel’s “national right” to these resources and argues they should be shared among local parties, especially as most of these reserves are in formally Palestinian-held territory, which Israel has occupied under deeply questionable means. Despite this, Israel has for decades been the only nation profiting off of the regional gas and oil fields it effectively stole from Palestine. They even refuse to supply Palestine with natural gas or let them extract it, as Israel is worried it would fund terrorism. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Like the open-air concentration camps, the massive military presence and apartheid state Israel… "

Would it surprise you to note that Girkin is currently in custody? He is awaiting trial on charges of inciting extremism. When Putin calls you ‘extremist’ then you have crossed the line with a bulldozer. Girkin says he would make a better president than Putin because Putin is gullible and “too kind”. Girkin’s Telegram post about “On running as a candidate for president of the Russian Federation”, also pointed a finger at the Russian officials responsible for advising Putin, saying they were still in place and “continue to amaze us with their incompetence.” Girkin said Putin had billionaire friends “to whom he cannot (due to the above-mentioned kindness and generosity of soul) refuse anything”, and that their wealth was growing faster than military production. Did I mention that he is in jail? "

There’ll be a reading, a talk, a surprise guest (!!) and a signing, with books on sale. Tell your friends! Come on down! How could this happen? Owners of Chamberlain MyQ automatic garage door openers just woke up to discover that the company had confiscated valuable features overnight, and that there was nothing they could do about it. Oh, we know what happened, technically speaking. Chamberlain shut off the API for its garage-door openers, which breaks their integration with home automation systems like Home Assistant. The company even announced that it was doing this, calling the integration an “unauthorized usage” of its products, though the “unauthorized” parties in this case are the people who own Chamberlain products: https://chamberlaingroup.com/press/a-message-about-our-decision-to-prevent-unauthorized-usage-of-myq We even know why Chamberlain did this. As Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo points out, shutting off the API is a way for Chamberlain to force its customers to use its ad-beshitted, worst-of-breed app, so that it can make a few pennies by nonconsensually monetizing its customers’ eyeballs: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/chamberlain-blocks-smart-garage-door-opener-from-working-with-smart-homes/ But how did this happen? How did a giant company like Chamberlain come to this enshittening juncture, in which it felt empowered to sabotage the products it had already sold to its customers? How can this be legal? How can it be good for business? How can the people who made this decision even look themselves in the mirror? To answer these questions, we must first consider the forces that discipline companies, acting against the impulse to enshittify their products and services. There are four constraints on corporate conduct: I. Competition. The fear of losing your business to a rival can stay even the most sociopathic corporate executive’s hand. II. Regulation. The fear of being fined, criminally sanctioned, or banned from doing business can check the greediest of leaders. III. Capability. Corporate executives can dream up all kinds of awful ways to shift value from your side of the ledger to their own, but they can only do the things that are technically feasible. IV. Self-help. The possibility of customers modifying, reconfiguring or altering their products to restore lost functionality or neutralize antifeatures carries an implied threat to vendors. If a printer company’s anti-generic-ink measures drives a customer to jailbreak their printers, the original manufacturer’s connection to that customer is permanently severed, as the customer creates a durable digital connection to a rival. When companies act in obnoxious, dishonest, shitty ways, they aren’t merely yielding to temptation — they are evading these disciplining forces. Thus, the Great Enshittening we are living through doesn’t reflect an increase in the wickedness of corporate leadership. Rather, it represents a moment in which each of these disciplining factors have been gutted by specific policies. This is good news, actually. We used to put down rat poison and we didn’t have a rat problem. Then we stopped putting down rat poison and rats are eating us alive. That’s not a nice feeling, but at least we know at least one way of addressing it — we can start putting down poison again. That is, we can start enforcing the rules that we stopped enforcing, in living memory. Having a terrible problem is no fun, but the best kind of terrible problem to have is one that you know a solution to. As it happens, Chamberlain is a neat microcosm for all the bad policy choices that created the Era of Enshittification. Let’s go through them: Competition: Chamberlain doesn’t have to worry about competition, because it is owned by a private equity fund that “rolled up” all of Chamberlain’s major competitors into a single, giant firm. Most garage-door opener brands are actually Chamberlain, including “LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Merlin, and Grifco”: https://www.lakewoodgaragedoor.biz/blog/the-history-of-garage-door-openers This is a pretty typical PE rollup, and it exploits a bug in US competition law called “Antitrust’s Twilight Zone”: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/16/schumpeterian-terrorism/#deliberately-broken When companies buy each other, they are subject to “merger scrutiny,” a set of guidelines that the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division use to determine whether the outcome is likely to be bad for competition. These rules have been pretty lax since the Reagan administration, but they’ve currently being revised to make them substantially more strict: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-ftc-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines One of the blind spots in these merger guidelines is an exemption for mergers valued at less than $101m. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, these fly under the radar, evading merger scrutiny. That means that canny PE companies can roll up dozens and dozens of standalone businesses, like funeral homes, hospital beds, magic mushrooms, youth addiction treatment centers, mobile home parks, nursing homes, physicians’ practices, local newspapers, or e-commerce sellers: http://www.economicliberties.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Serial-Acquisitions-Working-Paper-R4-2.pdf But antitrust enforcers aren’t helpless. Under (the long dormant) Section 7 of the Clayton Act, competition regulators can block mergers that lead to “incipient monopolization.” The incipiency standard prevented monopolies from forming from 1914, when the Clayton Act passed, until the Reagan administration. We used to put down rat poison, and we didn’t have rats. We stopped, and rats are gnawing our faces off. We still know where the rat poison is — maybe we should start putting it down again. On to regulation. How is it possible for Chamberlain to sell you a garage-door opener that has an API and works with your chosen home automation system, and then unilaterally confiscate that valuable feature? Shouldn’t regulation protect you from this kind of ripoff? It should, but it doesn’t. Instead, we have a bunch of regulations that protect Chamberlain from you. Think of binding arbitration, which allows Chamberlain to force you to click through an “agreement” that takes away your right to sue them or join a class-action suit: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#felony-contempt-of-business-model But regulation could protect you from Chamberlain. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act allows the FTC to ban any “unfair and deceptive” conduct. This law has been on the books since 1914, but Section 5 has been dormant, forgotten and unused, for decades. The FTC’s new dynamo chair, Lina Khan, has revived it, and is using it like a can-opener to free Americans who’ve been trapped by abusive conduct: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge Khan’s used Section 5 powers to challenge privacy invasions, noncompete clauses, and other corporate abuses — the bait-and-switch tactics of Chamberlain are ripe for a Section 5 case. If you buy a gadget because it has five features and then the vendor takes two of them away, they are clearly engaged in “unfair and deceptive” conduct. On to capability. Since time immemorial, corporate leaders have fetishized “flexibility” in their business arrangements — like the ability to do “dynamic pricing” that changes how much you pay for something based on their guess about how much you are willing to pay. But this impulse to play shell games runs up against the hard limits of physical reality: grocers just can’t send an army of rollerskated teenagers around the store to reprice everything as soon as a wealthy or desperate-looking customer comes through the door. They’re stuck with crude tactics like doubling the price of a flight that doesn’t include a Saturday stay as a way of gouging business travelers on an expense account. With any shell-game, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye. Corporate crooks armed with computers aren’t smarter or more wicked than their analog forebears, but they are faster. Digital tools allow companies to alter the “business logic” of their services from instant to instant, in highly automated ways: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ The monopoly coalition has successfully argued that this endless “twiddling” should not be constrained by privacy, labor or consumer protection law. Without these constraints, corporate twiddlers can engage in all kinds of ripoffs, like wage theft and algorithmic wage discrimination: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men Twiddling is key to the Darth Vader MBA (“I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it further”), in which features are confiscated from moment to moment, without warning or recourse: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/26/hit-with-a-brick/#graceful-failure There’s no reason to accept the premise that violating your privacy, labor rights or consumer rights with a computer is so different from analog ripoffs that existing laws don’t apply. The unconstrained twiddling of digital ripoff artists is a plague on billions of peoples’ lives, and any enforcer who sticks up for our rights will have an army of supporters behind them. Finally, there’s the fear of self-help measures. All the digital flexibility that tech companies use to take value away can be used to take it back, too. The whole modern history of digital computers is the history of “adversarial interoperability,” in which the sleazy antifeatures of established companies are banished through reverse-engineering, scraping, bots and other forms of technological guerrilla warfare: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability Adversarial interoperability represents a serious threat to established business. If you’re a printer company gouging on toner, your customers might defect to a rival that jailbreaks your security measures. That’s what happened to Lexmark, who lost a case against the toner-refilling company Static Controls, which went on to buy Lexmark: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/felony-contempt-business-model-lexmarks-anti-competitive-legacy Sure, your customers are busy and inattentive and you can degrade the quality of your product a lot before they start looking for ways out. But once they cross that threshold, you can lose them forever. That’s what happened to Microsoft: the company made the tactical decision to produce a substandard version of Office for the Mac in a drive to get Mac users to switch to Windows. Instead, Apple made Iwork (Pages, Numbers and Keynote), which could read and write every Office file, and Mac users threw away Office, the only Microsoft product they owned, permanently severing their relationship to the company: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay Today, companies can operate without worrying about this kind of self-help measure. There’ a whole slew of IP rights that Chamberlain can enforce against you if you try to fix your garage-door opener yourself, or look to a competitor to sell you a product that restores the feature they took away: https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ Jailbreaking your Chamberlain gadget in order to make it answer to a rival’s app involves bypassing a digital lock. Trafficking in a tool to break a digital lock is a felony under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright, carrying a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. In other words, it’s not just that tech isn’t regulated, allowing for endless twiddling against your privacy, consumer rights and labor rights. It’s that tech is badly regulated, to permit unlimited twiddling by tech companies to take away your rights and to prohibit any twiddling by you to take them back. The US government thumbs the scales against you, creating a regime that Jay Freeman aptly dubbed “felony contempt of business model”: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/23/how-to-fix-cars-by-breaking-felony-contempt-of-business-model/ All kinds of companies have availed themselves of this government-backed superpower. There’s DRM — digital locks, covered by DMCA 1201 — in powered wheelchairs: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-drm-comes-your-wheelchair In dishwashers: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/03/cassette-rewinder/#disher-bob In treadmills: https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/22/vapescreen/#jane-get-me-off-this-crazy-thing In tractors: https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/08/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors/ It should come as no surprise to learn that Chamberlain has used DMCA 1201 to block interoperable garage door opener components: https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=iplr That’s how we arrived at this juncture, where a company like Chamberlain can break functionality its customers value highly, solely to eke out a minuscule new line of revenue by selling ads on their own app. Chamberlain bought all its competitors. Chamberlain operates in a regulatory environment that is extremely tolerant of unfair and deceptive practices. Worse: they can unilaterally take away your right to sue them, which means that if regulators don’t bestir themselves to police Chamberlain, you are shit out of luck. Chamberlain has endless flexibility to unilaterally alter its products’ functionality, in fine-grained ways, even after you’ve purchased them. Chamberlain can sue you if you try to exercise some of that same flexibility to protect yourself from their bad practices. Combine all four of those factors, and of course Chamberlain is going to enshittify its products. Every company has had that one weaselly asshole at the product-planning table who suggests a petty grift like breaking every one of the company’s customers’ property to sell a few ads. But historically, the weasel lost the argument to others, who argued that making every existing customer furious would affect the company’s bottom line, costing it sales and/or fines, and prompting customers to permanently sever their relationship with the company by seeking out and installing alternative software. Take away all the constraints on a corporation’s worst impulses, and this kind of conduct is inevitable: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/ This isn’t limited to Chamberlain. Without the discipline of competition, regulation, self-help measures or technological limitations, every industry in undergoing wholesale enshittification. It’s not a coincidence that Chamberlain’s grift involves a push to move users into its app. Because apps can’t be reverse-engineered and modified without risking DMCA 1201 prosecution, forcing a user into an app is a tidy and reliable way to take away that user’s rights. Think about ad-blocking. One in four web users has installed an ad-blocker (“the biggest boycott in world history” -Doc Searls). Zero app users have installed app-blockers, because they don’t exist, because making one is a felony. An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/27/an-audacious-plan-to-halt-the-internets-enshittification-and-throw-it-into-reverse/ The temptation to enshitiffy isn’t new, but the ability to do so without consequence is a modern phenomenon, the intersection of weak policy enforcement and powerful technology. Your car is autoenshittified, a rolling rent-seeking platform that spies on you and price-gouges you: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon Cars are in an uncontrolled skid over Enshittification Cliff. Honda, Toyota, VW and GM all sell cars with infotainment systems that harvest your connected phone’s text-messages and send them to the corporation for data-mining. What’s more, a judge in Washington state just ruled that this is legal: https://therecord.media/class-action-lawsuit-cars-text-messages-privacy While there’s no excuse for this kind of sleazy conduct, we can reasonably anticipate that if our courts would punish companies for engaging in it, they might be able to resist the temptation. No wonder Mozilla’s latest Privacy Not Included research report called cars “the worst product category we have ever reviewed”: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/ I mean, Nissan tries to infer facts about your sex life and sells those inferences to marketing companies: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/nissan/ But the OG digital companies are the masters of enshittification. Microsoft has been at this game for longer than anyone, and every day brings a fresh way that Microsoft has worsened its products without fear of consequence. The latest? You can’t delete your OneDrive account until you provide an acceptable explanation for your disloyalty: https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952878/microsoft-onedrive-windows-close-app-notification It’s tempting to think that the cruelty is the point, but it isn’t. It’s almost never the point. The point is power and money. Unscrupulous businesses have found ways to make money by making their products worse since the industrial revolution. Here’s Jules Dupuis, writing about 19th century French railroads: https://www.tumblr.com/mostlysignssomeportents/731357317521719296/having-refused-the-poor-what-is-necessary-they But as bad as all this is, let me remind you about the good part: we know how to stop companies from enshittifying their products. We know what disciplines their conduct: competition, regulation, capability and self-help measures. Yes, rats are gnawing our eyeballs, but we know which rat-poison to use, and where to put it to control those rats. Competition, regulation, constraint and self-help measures all backstop one another, and while one or a few can make a difference, they are most powerful when they’re all mobilized in concert. Think of the failure of the EU’s landmark privacy law, the GDPR. While the GDPR proved very effective against bottom-feeding smaller ad-tech companies, the worse offenders, Meta and Google, have thumbed their noses at it. This was enabled in part by the companies’ flying an Irish flag of convenience, maintaining the pretense that they have to be regulated in a notorious corporate crime-haven: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town That let them get away with all kinds of shenanigans, like ignoring the GDPR’s requirement that you should be able to easily opt out of data-collection without having to go through cumbersome “cookie consent” dialogs or losing access to the service as punishment for declining to be tracked. As the noose has tightened around these surveillance giants, they’re continuing to play games. Meta now says that the only way to opt out of data-collection in the EU is to pay for the service: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/30/markets-remaining-irrational/#steins-law This is facially illegal under the GDPR. Not only are they prohibited from punishing you for opting out of collection, but the whole scheme ignores the nature of private data collection. If Facebook collects the fact that you and I are friends, but I never opted into data-collection, they have violated the GDPR, even if you were coerced into granting consent: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/the-pay-or-consent-challenge-for-platform-regulators.html The GDPR has been around since 2016 and Google and Meta are still invading 500 million Europeans’ privacy. This latest delaying tactic could add years to their crime-spree before they are brought to justice. But most of this surveillance is only possible because so much of how you interact with Google and Meta is via an app, and an app is just a web-page that’s a felony to make an ad-blocker for. If the EU were to legalize breaking DRM — repealing Article 6 of the 2001 Copyright Directive — then we wouldn’t have to wait for the European Commission to finally wrestle these two giant companies to the ground. Instead, EU companies could make alternative clients for all of Google and Meta’s services that don’t spy on you, without suffering the fate of OG App, which tried this last winter and was shut down by “felony contempt of business model”: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained Enshittification is demoralizing. To quote Wil Wheaton, every update to the services we use inspires “dread of ‘How will this complicate things as I try to maintain privacy and sanity in a world that demands I have this thing to operate?’” https://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/698603648058556416/cory-doctorow-if-you-see-this-and-have-thoughts But there are huge natural constituencies for the four disciplining forces that keep enshittification at bay. Remember, Antitrust’s Twilight Zone doesn’t just allow rollups of garage-door opener companies — it’s also poison for funeral homes, hospital beds, magic mushrooms, youth addiction treatment centers, mobile home parks, nursing homes, physicians’ practices, local newspapers, or e-commerce sellers. The Binding Arbitration scam that stops Chamberlain customers from suing the company also stops Uber drivers from suing over stolen wages, Turbotax customers from suing over fraud, and many other victims of corporate crime from getting a day in court. The failure to constrain twiddling to protect privacy, labor rights and consumer rights enables a host of abuses, from stalking, doxing and SWATting to wage theft and price gouging: https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens And Felony Contempt of Business Model is used to screw you over every time you refill your printer, run your dishwasher, or get your Iphone’s screen replaced. The actions needed to halt and reverse this enshittification are well understood, and the partisans for taking those actions are too numerous to count. It’s taken a long time for all those individuals suffering under corporate abuses to crystallize into a movement, but at long last, it’s happening.

https://medium.com/@wpr/how-a-wonky-global-affairs-journal-found-an-audience-among-high-school-students-and-teachers-5c9c9bfacc62?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Hampton Stephens didn’t know at first why high school teachers suddenly started subscribing to World Politics Review. As the founder of the online publication, which provides expert analysis and in-depth news on global affairs, information about new subscribers regularly comes across his desk, and sometime in 2014 he noticed that several new signups were associated with high schools. This was a surprise to him, as they didn’t fit the profile of a typical subscriber. When he looked into the matter further, he realized it was often a particular kind of high school teacher who subscribed. “There’s a form that a new subscriber can fill out that asks about their occupation,” he said. “Most of them were identifying themselves as speech teachers or coaches of the school debate team.” In cases in which a teacher didn’t fill out a form, Stephens would Google the person’s name and often come across a LinkedIn profile or school page identifying them as a debate coach. At the time, this wasn’t a demographic that World Politics Review actively targeted. Stephens founded the company in 2006 while getting a master’s degree in statecraft and world politics. He’d previously written for a trade publication covering the defense industry, and after failing to land some foreign policy op-eds in traditional news outlets, he started publishing them to his own website. “It was a hobby at first and people I knew started contributing basically for free,” he recalled. “I had a vague idea that it could be a business, and back then everyone thought you could support this kind of thing through advertising.” But Stephens soon realized that a niche publication like World Politics Review could never achieve the kind of scale needed to attract much advertising revenue. In 2008, it moved most of its content behind a paywall, and its initial subscribers consisted of people who utilized its content for their jobs — mostly academics and wonks who worked in foreign policy. Would you like a free trial of World Politics Review for your speech and debate team? Contact us to request a trial. In those early days, Stephens focused on attracting individual subscribers, and while some did turn over their credit cards to subscribe, he had trouble scaling these types of subscriptions to a sustainable level. World Politics Review didn’t begin to achieve a real footing until 2012, when Stephens formed a partnership with EBSCO, an information services company that sells journal subscriptions to universities and other institutions. “I pitched them on a joint venture where EBSCO would represent us,” said Stephens. “At the time it didn’t have any sort of database of foreign policy or international affairs content, so my pitch was that it could use its sales force to sell access to World Politics Review to universities.” The venture worked. Because World Politics Review was able to sell lucrative institutional licenses, it scaled up its business much more quickly. Today, most of its revenue comes from institutions, but individuals are still able to sign up for about $100 a year, and the individual subscriber base is now growing quickly; it was this latter option through which high school debate coaches started to subscribe. Stephens actually participated on the debate team in high school, so he had a hunch as to why they were embracing World Politics Review. “One aspect of debate competition involves extemporaneous speaking on current affairs where you draw a topic and then you’re allowed a small amount of allotted time to research and compose a speech,” he said. “So my thinking was that World Politics Review was being used in those areas where students are engaging with current affairs and foreign policy.” To understand how teachers were using World Politics Review, I reached out and interviewed a few of them. One person I spoke to was Harry Strong, a debate coach at The Potomac School, a private institution in Northern Virginia that enrolls students in kindergarten through 12th grade. When Strong joined the school four years ago, it only had 11 debaters. Now he leads a team of about 100 students, and the Potomac School is ranked second in the state. Last year, one of its students won the tournament of champions in extemporaneous speaking. It’s this event for which Strong’s team most often uses World Politics Review. For it, a debate team is given a topic and a half hour to prepare a speech. They’re not permitted to access the internet, but they can bring materials in with them. “In extemporaneous speaking, you never know what you’re drawing out of the envelope,” said Strong. “You might know the tournament’s going to have a round about, say, North American economics, but you have no idea how specific the questions will be. So prior to the competition the students are doing a lot of reading.” In addition to all the free resources that can be found on the internet, the students also have access to several subscription-only publications chosen by Strong. They include The New York Times, The Economist, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and, yes, World Politics Review. Strong explained that they spend much of their time each week poring through print and digital issues. “They will tear apart The Economist every week, for example. They’re rapacious readers.” The students use software called Prepd to sort and store digital articles that can be accessed via a flash drive during extemporaneous speaking competitions. “They would literally push a button in Prepd that would capture that article, strip it of its advertising, and then they’re able to tag it to whatever they want it filed under. So if I was looking at an article about Mozambique, I could stick it in a Mozambique file.” Strong chose World Politics Review as one of the few publishers his school is willing to pay for because of how well it drills down into the issues his debate team needs to study. “It does a great job of succinctly giving us sufficient background on the current events they’re writing about,” he said. “A lot of articles in other publications don’t do that, or if they do it takes them 10,000 words to do it, whereas with World Politics Review I get all the information I need on the same issue and I get it in just 1,500 words.” Would you like a free trial of World Politics Review for your speech and debate team? Contact us to request a trial. Melissa Reynold’s students also use World Politics Review for extemporaneous speaking competitions. She’s been a speech and debate teacher at a private Catholic high school in Kansas City for 33 years, and though she doesn’t remember when exactly she first came across World Politics Review, she’s fairly sure she understood its value right away. She only has a small budget for digital subscriptions — in fact, she pays for some of them out of her own pocket — and she found its coverage superior to other foreign affairs publications. “It’s so comprehensive in terms of all the various regions that it covers,” she said. “I just really loved the quality of the analysis — not only just the depth but also the breadth of topics that are covered. It’s easy for the kids to read an article, understand it, and then to be able to use it. It gives you a really good base knowledge of the events themselves.” I asked Reynolds how her students access World Politics Review articles. In many cases, she forwards them herself. She takes advantage of a feature on the website that allows her to sign up for regular email briefs of specific topics. “I get a little bit of an overview of major breaking stuff that’s happening each day in my inbox,” she said. “And then each day’s email has specific links to other sources on breaking issues. So I just always feel like it’s my first place to go to just kind of assess, ‘okay, what’s the newest stuff going on right now around the world?’” Because Reynolds often pays for subscriptions out of her own pocket, she’s extremely price sensitive. About a year into her World Politics Review subscription she received a notification that the introductory discount she received would be ending. “I contacted customer service and I ended up getting a personal email back from Hampton,” she recalled. “He asked me about my situation, and when I explained it to him he made me an incredible offer in terms of controlling the price so that we still had access.” That level of customer service endeared her to the publication even more. “The responsiveness is just beyond comparison. I would stick with it even if I felt like the product was very similar to something else on the market.” Stephens explained that, thus far, much of the subscriber interest from debate coaches has come in organically; he hasn’t made much of an effort yet to sell World Politics Review directly to high schools. “But I think there could be some potential here.” He has plans for more outreach to the market. “There are thousands of debate teams across the United States, and while it’s not ever going to make up the majority of our business, it could be significant.” Having been a high school debater himself, Stephens is especially enthusiastic about being able to provide a useful resource to these high school competitors. “I competed in extemporaneous speaking myself in high school, and I actually see some of the roots of my career in journalism and media in that experience,” he said. “The process of researching a topic and composing a fact-based analysis is very similar to journalism. I think speech and debate is actually very valuable experience and training for high school students regardless of what they plan to pursue in college and beyond. So it’s exciting for me to be involved again in speech and debate in some small way.” Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist. "
https://medium.com/@wpr/what-xi-jinping-means-for-china-and-the-u-s-607b0ab404e2?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"With no term limits, and no named successor, Xi Jinping could be the president of China for life. But whispers of dissent might be emerging. Find out what that means for China, and for the U.S., when you read World Politics Review (WPR). Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, made waves among Chinese academics and China-watchers in July with a published essay denouncing President Xi Jinping’s hard-line policies. The essay has been cited in numerous Western media outlets as a “rare rebuke” of Xi. The incident and other rumors of internal party dissent led Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, to wonder whether Xi has “passed his peak.” The pushback among elites, which McGregor characterizes so far as “whisperings,” have mainly been concerned with the Mao-like cult of personality surrounding Xi, who has amassed power unseen in China since Mao Zedong. The president of China may be finding, as Tom Mitchell wrote in the Financial Times, that “with absolute power has come absolute responsibility.” Are hard-line policies and unchecked power turning China’s elite against President Xi Jinping? Learn more, in Are ‘Whisperings’ in China the Beginning of a Backlash Against the Cult of Xi? at World Politics Review. The recent whispers come close on the heels of President Xi Jinping’s cementing of power in Beijing. At the National People’s Congress, which concluded on March 20, China’s top brass abolished presidential term limits, a stunning reversal of two decades of incremental institutionalization aimed at stabilizing government turnover. Commentators uniformly denounced the move, with many characterizing it as a Xi “power grab.” Others warned that China may be returning to the Mao era of strongman rule. Fears of increased repression are well founded, but this does not mean that stronger Communist Party rule will fail in its main purpose, which is the realization of difficult but needed changes to China’s governance and economy. Despite echoes of Chairman Mao’s repressive rule, President Xi Jinping may be leading China toward a national revitalization. To learn more, read China’s Strengthening of Communist Party Rule Is Not Just a Power Grab at World Politics Review. Despite slowing economic growth and a bruising trade war with the United States, Xi seems intent to push forward with his efforts to strengthen the party’s hegemony, particularly over China’s economy. At a speech in December marking the 40th anniversary of a watershed moment in what would become China’s program of economic liberalization, officially known as “reform and opening up,” he showed no inclination toward deepening China’s market-oriented reforms. Before the speech, some observers had wondered if Xi would signal a shift in Beijing’s handling of state-owned enterprises, in particular. But despite plenty of vague proclamations like “opening brings progress while closure leads to backwardness,” he did not propose any specific new measures in his nearly 90-minute speech. Instead, Xi struck a defiant tone. “It was precisely because we’ve adhered to the centralized and united leadership of the party that we were able to achieve this great historic transition,” Xi declared. “The party leads everything.” And for the foreseeable future, Xi will lead the party. Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to have put any further meaningful economic reforms on the backburner. Read more, in Xi Stays the Course in Speech Commemorating China’s Pathbreaking Reforms at World Politics Review. Xi’s presidency has catalyzed a rapid change in the U.S. foreign policy consensus on China over the past few years, which reflects the degree to which the assumptions that long guided Washington’s approach to China were both overly pessimistic and overly optimistic in ways that now seem obvious. Overly pessimistic, because China’s restrictions on speech and dissent have neither stifled innovation nor constrained the aspirations of an expanded middle class. Overly optimistic, because instead of China’s integration with the global economy leading to liberalization at home and moderation abroad, China under Xi has grown more repressive and assertive. This slow awakening to the breaking bad version of China’s rise has now matured into a full-blown movement in Washington fixated on the “China threat.” The idea that China represents an existential threat to the U.S. and the international order has become increasingly mainstream. Talk of a second Cold War is now commonplace in foreign policy coverage, as are calls for a containment approach to China. But is this the right way for the U.S. to address the challenge posed by Xi’s China? Calls for a new Cold War pitting the U.S. against China are off the mark. Read more, in The U.S. Should Base Its China Strategy on Competitive Cooperation, Not Containment at World Politics Review. China’s President Xi Jinping is using tools from the past to shape the future, as a revitalized Chinese Communist Party is stoking renewed fears of repression and censorship.

https://medium.com/@wpr/why-are-violent-rap-lyrics-being-blamed-for-a-crime-wave-in-london-5ca8ae168b4?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"LONDON — In late August, this city achieved a grim milestone: The Metropolitan Police announced they were investigating the 100th “violent death” recorded since the start of the year. Well before that case was recorded, a spate of violent crime in London had already sparked a lot of somber rhetoric and debate. After an especially bloody spring, media on both sides of the Atlantic seized on the fact that London’s murder rate had eclipsed that of New York City for the first time. In truth, that statistic only applied to February and March; by the year’s halfway point, New York had seen 147 homicides compared to 70 in London. But that did not stop U.S. President Donald Trump from invoking the dangers of the British capital in a speech to the National Rifle Association in May, highlighting knife crime in particular. “They don’t have guns. They have knives and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital. They say it’s as bad as a military war zone hospital. Knives, knives, knives, knives,” Trump said, miming a stabbing motion. “London hasn’t been used to that. They’re getting used to it. It’s pretty tough.” In the U.K., the murder statistics have fueled alarmist media coverage and increased police scrutiny on areas of the city seen as hotbeds for crime. Along with some of the usual, stereotypical suspects — drug gangs, a lack of parental role models — this attention has focused on a relatively new kind of rap music known as “drill.” Born on the south side of Chicago in the early years of this decade, drill spread quickly via YouTube clips and has been embraced by black British boys and young men in London’s poor housing projects. It has thrived in neighborhoods and among young people associated, fairly or not, with hyper-local criminal activity, small-time drug dealing and conflict, often involving violence or threats of violence. Want to read more news and analysis on global affairs? Sign up for WPR’s free daily newsletter. The name “drill” is intended to carry military connotations, and it befits a genre that is typically monotone, repetitive and shot through with grim social realism; the songs are not especially bright or melodic. There is also a remarkable aesthetic consistency to drill songs and their accompanying music videos. (Because the primary platform for drill is YouTube, the songs and videos are inseparable.) The rappers’ bleak lyrics frequently depict knife crime and other forms of violence, local rivalries, poverty and drug-dealing. The videos are often shot at night, and the rappers they feature are dressed in black and wear masks. To be sure, these are tropes that have figured in rap music for decades. But where drill differs from 1990s gangster rap is the precise specificity of the violence, and its routine descriptions of real-world incidents and threats to rivals on the streets of London. These descriptions and threats also appear on social media, primarily Snapchat and Instagram. Rising public concern about drill’s capacity to fuel violence has coincided with a media frenzy and stern words from Britain’s senior police commanders, politicians and judicial officials. In May, when asked about the apparent rise in violent crime, Cressida Dick, London’s police chief, said the problem was partly due to reductions in police resources, but also condemned “lyrics which glamorize violence, serious violence, murder, stabbings.” She dismissed the notion that drill was “just music,” contending instead that such songs have “a terrible effect.” Reflecting this viewpoint, one aspect of the police’s response to the crime wave has been to censor so-called drillers by publicly pressuring YouTube to remove some drill videos. Law enforcement officials have also initiated unprecedented and contentious legal proceedings to forbid rappers from discussing certain topics, using certain words and addressing certain individuals in their lyrics. Yet despite officials’ apparent desire to curb the purported influence of drill, little attention seems to have been paid to the harsh socioeconomic realities facing the men and boys creating it, and how those realities have been compounded by cuts to public services after years of austerity. At the same time, it’s difficult to argue that some public concern about drill isn’t justified. There is significant, though by no means complete, overlap between drillers and young people engaged in criminal activity. This makes it difficult for well-meaning proponents of the arts and free expression — those inclined to say that the songs are “just a performance” — to defend everything that the rappers have produced. In the past two or three years, a staggering number of artists in London’s drill scene have ended up in jail. Others have been involved in violent altercations in which they’ve been stabbed and, in some cases, killed. One South London drill crew, called Moscow17, lost two members in a matter of months this summer: 17-year-old Rhyhiem Barton, known as GB, was shot deadin May, and 23-year-old Sidique Kamara, known as Incognito, was murdered in August; they died on the very same street. Only a week before Kamara’s killing, 18-year-old Latwaan Griffiths had been stabbed to death nearby. Griffiths rapped under the name SA, for Splash Addict, which is a reference to stabbing. He was a member of the Harlem Spartans, a drill crew based out of a housing project less than a mile away from Moscow17. After Griffiths’ death, his family issued a public plea for information about the perpetrator and for an end to the violence. “We as a family are broken, we are riddled with heartache, we will never be the same. We want to put Latwaan to rest, but we cannot do that unless you help us with this murder inquiry,” the family’s statement said. “We know that nothing we do collectively as a family or community can bring Latwaan back to life, but what we do know is that his murderer is still out there, and there is nothing stopping YOU from being the next victim of a knife or gun crime.” ‘Like There’s No Way Out’ Drill is an almost exclusively male rap subgenre, and toxic masculinity — manifesting in casual sexism as well as violence — compounds the artists’ troubled home lives and the social problems they encounter. In this context, it’s no surprise that young women from similar backgrounds are often left out of discussions of the issues affecting their brothers and friends. But that doesn’t mean they don’t experience them, too. Ray BLK, an R&B singer from South London whose real name is Rita Ekwere, has firsthand knowledge of many the issues that inform drill lyrics. She still remembers the horror she felt the first time she saw a gun brandished during an argument at a party, when she was just 14. She can also describe her male peers’ rapid desensitization to this type of violence, and their experience of adolescence as kind of trap — an impression exacerbated by alienation from the state. “You can’t go to a local youth center because they’ve all been closed. You definitely can’t talk to the police,” she says. “A lot of people feel like they’re not going to give you any sort of protection, if you ask for help, and you’ll be ostracized by your community. So you feel like there’s no way out.” Want to read more news and analysis on global affairs? Sign up for WPR’s free daily newsletter. While the media fixates on violence, the psychological trauma suffered by those growing up in these environments is barely considered. “So many of these young boys have mental health issues and aren’t even aware of it. They don’t know why they act or feel the way they do,” she says. “When you listen to drill music, a lot of the words are very powerful, very dark, and you can hear the pain in the music. As much as they are speaking about violent crimes and drug dealing, they are trying to speak the truth, and using music as a form of catharsis. You’re hearing a 14-year-old rapping about how his family don’t know where he is, because he’s in a trap house somewhere outside of London, sleeping on the floor with 10 crackheads. It is so traumatic, it’s unimaginable.” Such details, she says, underscore the need for better mental health services for young people. Yet these services are currently in a desperate state, having been gutted by funding cuts in the years since the Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition came to power in 2010, with David Cameron as prime minister. According to one study, total spending on youth services has fallen by more than 60 percent in that period. Schools, youth centers and dedicated youth mental health programs have all suffered. In the South London borough of Lewisham, one English teacher whose students have included multiple aspiring drill rappers says he’s seen good teachers and support workers leave the profession because they were overwhelmed by the challenges facing them. Homework clubs and extracurricular programs like music clubs and group outings to cultural events in central London have been canceled due to cuts in funding. The limited resources that remain have gone toward so-called behavior officers tasked with addressing disciplinary problems and “putting out fires.” Outside of school hours, students are left to fend for themselves on the streets, especially those whose parents, many of whom are in precarious employment situations, work long and difficult hours. . . .

https://medium.com/@wpr/they-took-on-the-philippines-powerful-mining-interests-and-are-paying-with-their-lives-a420a6acbf9e?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Editor’s note: This is the first installment of a two-part series on killings of environmental activists in the Philippines, funded by WPR’s International Reporting Fellowship. The second installment will run Oct. 18. COMPOSTELA VALLEY, MINDANAO, Philippines — It was just after dawn on the southern island of Mindanao, but police officers already had a call to respond to. Winding their way through the scenic green mountains of the Compostela Valley, they approached the scene of the crime, a patch of dirt on the side of a highway. But when they got there, they found no witnesses, and no sign of the perpetrator. All they could see was a sack of corn, its contents spilled across the road, stained red with blood. The blood belonged to Jimmy Saypan, a local farmer. He had left his house early that morning in October 2016 to go work on his vegetable farm in the next town over. His wife, Ruby, had watched his motorcycle disappear down the driveway only to come sputtering back moments later with Jimmy hunched over the handlebars. He was clutching his stomach as blood oozed out of a bullet wound in his gut. At the time, Saypan was the leader of the Compostela Farmers Association, or CFA, a group of some 500 farmers opposing a large-scale mining exploration project in the valley. The group held rallies and circulated petitions that protested government permits and challenged one of the most powerful companies in the Philippines. Under Saypan’s leadership, the CFA had become one of the country’s most prominent anti-mining groups, a thorn in the side of mining companies and pro-mining politicians. As the CFA’s reputation grew, Saypan started to feel as though he had a target on his back. Military men were coming by the house. Gripping their machine guns, they would warn that his protesting could get him into trouble. “Of course there were threats, but we were still surprised something actually happened,” Ruby Saypan says. Jimmy Saypan died in a hospital bed 24 hours after he was shot. The only thing he managed to tell Ruby was that the shooter had been on a blue motorcycle waiting for him at the end of the driveway. Little came of the murder investigation — the police never made an arrest — but the blood-spattered corn seeds at the crime scene became a much-discussed detail among other Compostela farmers, a gruesome symbol of the dangers they faced as long as valuable minerals remained buried under their land. — Extrajudicial killings are nothing new in the Philippines. Since the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, who was president for 20 years beginning in the mid-1960s, the Philippine government has been known for carrying out arbitrary arrests and summary executions of political rivals and critics. The country’s current president, Rodrigo Duterte, has publicly encouraged the killings of suspected drug users and dealers in the streets without trial; Human Rights Watch estimates that Duterte’s war on drugs has resulted in more than 12,000 deaths. But while these killings have received widespread international attention, a coinciding uptick in assassinations targeting environmentalists has flown mostly under the radar. Saypan’s murder was just one of 109 reported killings of environmental activists and land defenders in the Philippines between 2015 and 2017, according to human rights groups. Global Witness, a London-based NGO that tracks environmentalist murders, reported that 43 of those murders occurred in 2017 alone, the highest annual death toll for any Asian country ever recorded. Before their deaths, most of the victims were active in protesting mining, logging, coal or agribusiness operations. In many cases, the environmental destruction was happening on the victim’s own land or ancestral domain. Masked men carried out most of the killings in motorcycle drive-by shootings, making it difficult to identify the culprits. No arrests were made in any of the murders. Still, experts and human rights groups contend that the military, private corporate security outfits and local politicians are likely behind the violence, and Global Witness found signs of military involvement in 56 percent of last year’s murders. Officials with the Philippine government’s Mining and Geosciences Bureau, the national agency that authorizes mining projects, canceled a scheduled interview for this story and declined to comment. “The motivation of the killing of the activists is difficult to ferret out,” says William Holden, a geographer at the University of Calgary who has studied the murders of activists in the Philippines. “But two things are happening for sure: You have rich and powerful people who want things done, and you have poor people who get in their way.” Erasing a Community Saypan’s anti-mining struggle began five years before his was killed. In April 2011, the government granted Agusan Petroleum and Minerals Corporation, or AgPet, an exploration permit to search for gold, copper and silver in the Compostela Valley. The permit covered over 30,000 acres, including farms and small-scale mining operations that belonged to CFA members. Saypan and the other CFA leaders worried that if AgPet struck gold, the company would build a mine and take over their land. The CFA’s plight quickly got the attention of the Philippine media, and the group drew fierce support from human rights and environmental groups. By 2015, as AgPet was preparing to bring in more equipment for exploration, the CFA had won over the local government in Compostela. That March, the municipal council issued a resolution asking the Mines and Geosciences Bureau to cancel AgPet’s exploration permit. Instead of heeding the council’s suggestion, the bureau canceled the council’s resolution in May and ordered the military to enforce AgPet’s “unhampered exploration activities.” Military intervention in support of extractive industries is common in the Philippines. Officially, the military can break up protests and provide security for company officials. Unofficially, the military can do whatever it deems necessary to move a project forward. According to human rights groups and protesters, this means using intimidation and violence to clear out entire towns and villages to make way for mining companies. The decision by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau left CFA members with two options: They could back down, or they could try to stop AgPet by force. A week after the bureau issued its order, AgPet workers arrived in Compostela with drilling equipment. Hundreds of CFA members were there to meet them, blocking the only road in. The barricade stalled the project, but trouble followed for the protesters. A month later, the army fired on the house of Bello Tindasan, a CFA leader. Tindasan wasn’t home, but his wife and two of his children were forced to hunker on the floor for 20 minutes while bullets ripped through the building. According to a news report published at the time of the shooting, the army said members of a communist rebel group were hiding out in Tindasan’s house. The shooting was only the beginning. The military set up checkpoints and made house calls, threatening protesters with retribution. The CFA nevertheless continued its protests. In 2016, CFA members started turning up dead. Jimmy Saypan’s murder was the first of nine. Though human rights groups insist that military personnel were behind the deaths, none of the killings has been solved. . . .

https://medium.com/@wpr/how-the-global-refugee-crisis-has-transformed-europe-6f814d82020d?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"As the nationalist, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats claimed their best result yet in Sweden’s parliamentary elections in September, the nation’s newspapers went bold with their headlines. “Chaos,” read the front pages, in all caps, of the two largest tabloids. Dagens Industri, a financial newspaper, called the outcome “a political earthquake.” But the subject of their worry was not the rise of the Sweden Democrats, the latest party to surf Europe’s anti-establishment populist wave. Instead, it was the utter fragmentation of the country’s political landscape.That few focused their attention on the far-right party’s performance — it gained seats but still came in third behind the center-right bloc and the ruling center-left coalition — speaks to its normalization. By the time voters went to the polls Sunday, the Sweden Democrats had already drastically reshaped the political climate. Immigration, once the exclusive rallying cry of the Sweden Democrats, dominated much of the pre-election debate in a country renowned for its humanitarian values. Over 160,000 asylum-seekers arrived in 2015, adding to a population that has rapidly grown more diverse. Of Sweden’s current population of 10 million, 18 percent were born abroad. Changing demographics are not new to Sweden — just ask the indigenous Sami population — but never before have they influenced an election like this one.

Sweden isn’t the only country where the backlash against asylum-seekers is shifting politics to the right. Earlier this summer, the leaders of Bavaria’s conservative Christian Social Union, the sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, threatened to bring down the German government in a showdown with Merkel over stricter measures for refugees and asylum-seekers. The move was largely seen as an attempt by the party, which is facing a challenge from the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, to prove it was tough enough on migration issues. It didn’t work out the way they intended. Two months after Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, the head of the CSU, first went head-to-head with Merkel, the party’s fortunes have declined further and its prospects look dimmer ahead of pivotal regional elections next month. The episode illustrates the perils for Europe’s center-right parties of shifting to the right in an effort to poach voters from the far-right.

Although the number of new arrivals has declined dramatically since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, asylum-seekers continue to feature prominently in European political debates, and Spain is no exception. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 22,500 migrants reached the Spanish coast by sea in the first seven months of this year — more than in all of 2017. Another 307 have died trying. As Italy’s populist government continues to pursue hard-line anti-migrant policies, Spain has recently replaced Italy as the top destination for Europe-bound migrants. The uptick has roughly coincided with the early days of Spain’s new socialist, center-left government led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who was sworn into office in early June. Sanchez came to power after a corruption scandal triggered a no-confidence vote that ended the tenure of his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, from the more conservative People’s Party. He lost no time setting himself apart from Rajoy on a number of issues, perhaps most prominently immigration.

How Will They Be Received? for FREE with your subscription to World Politics Review. If the number of asylum-seekers and migrants has decreased dramatically since 2015, it is in part due to the European Agenda on Migration, an important framework for developing a comprehensive and multidimensional response to a complex and pressing challenge. However, the agenda addresses migration through a framework of deterrence, which is designed to prevent people from arriving in the EU in the first place, rather than to address the drivers of migration directly. This deterrent approach is by no means new, and it has already failed — not least in the emergence and escalation of the crisis that led to the agenda in the first place. While it has reduced the flow of migrants that reach Europe, it ignores the factors that cause them to leave their home countries.

https://medium.com/@wpr/the-saudi-qatar-crisis-creates-collateral-damage-in-the-persian-gulf-and-beyond-955ae631e289?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"The standoff pitting Saudi Arabia and the UAE versus Qatar is bringing new tensions to the Persian Gulf, and there’s no end in sight. Will the crisis be too much for the region? Find out more when you subscribe to World Politics Review (WPR). In the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s first official visit abroad to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, long-simmering tensions among America’s allies in the Persian Gulf boiled over. It all started the day after Trump left Riyadh. The Qatari news agency, QNA, reported that the country’s ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, had given a stunning commencement speech to a graduating class of National Guard members. In the speech, the emir fulminated against Qatar’s neighbors, accusing them of engaging in a campaign to smear Qatar in front of Trump, in an effort to make the state appear to be a supporter of terrorism. But the emir not only rejected the accusation, he flipped it on his accusers, declaring that, “The real danger is in the course taken by ‘certain governments’ that created terrorism by adopting an extremist form of Islam” — a thinly veiled effort to paint Saudi Arabia, among others, as the cause of terrorism. The quotes, which also appeared on Qatari television as scrolled text below video of the emir, went on to say that the emir defended Qatar’s unconventional foreign policy, including its ties to Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and even Israel. Reaction to news of the speech was immediate and predictably fiery. Within just 30 minutes of posting the report, the QNA website removed it. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry announced that the entire report was fraudulent, posted to the QNA website by hackers. But Qatar’s neighbors, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, rejected that claim and soon imposed a blockade of the peninsular nation. The Gulf crisis pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and the UAE didn’t appear from out of the blue, however. Disagreements have divided Qatar from its neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for many years. Arab regimes have long resented Qatar’s Al Jazeera television network, whose arrival sent shockwaves across a region that is used to placid, acquiescent state-owned media. Qatar’s support for the short-lived Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt became another point of contention, and its support for other rebel groups in Libya and Syria made matters worse.

A ransom payment for a kidnapped royal hunting party. Hacking claims and “fake news.” The rift between Qatar, the tiny Gulf state with a big foreign policy agenda, and its neighbors, led by Saudi Arabia, began with all the makings of a geopolitical soap opera, and the plot kept thickening. The Qatar blockade, imposed by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United Arab Emirates, has deep roots in disagreements over approaches to the region’s many challenges. Much of the coverage of the dispute has focused on Saudi and Emirati interests that Qatar has pointedly bucked for years, with its support for Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and its softer line on Iran. But lost in this circus is what Qatar wants, and how tensions with its much larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, escalated to this point. Qatar’s outsized ambition in the region has more to do with the desire to break out of Saudi Arabia’s shadow — and needle the Saudis a bit — through an independent foreign policy designed to make it everyone’s friend. To learn more about the tensions that led to the Qatar blockade and Gulf crisis, read The Policies Fueling the Qatar-Saudi Rift Have Long Guided Qatari Diplomacy for FREE with your subscription to World Politics Review. To the surprise of many observers, the GCC-Qatar crisis in the Persian Gulf has grown into a stalemate, with increasing costs for the region. The Qatar blockade, explained by the GCC as a response to Qatar’s supporting terrorism, engaging Iran, and undermining stability in the region through its sponsorship of Al Jazeera, is an aggressive political and economic attack on Qatar. None of the possible outcomes for the crisis — continued stalemate; acceptance of general principles to restore, in part, the status quo ante; or military action to achieve change in Doha — will erase the harm already done to the region. And this feud only plays into the hands of the GCC’s enemies, whether across the Gulf waters or closer to home.

The blockade of Qatar puts into question the viability of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as the split within the GCC that pits regional powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Qatar has proven surprisingly durable. Kuwaiti efforts to mediate the dispute have failed, and the intra-Gulf rupture has spilled over to the region’s external relations, making it harder for security partners to insist on maintaining even and equal relations with all GCC members. Even so, in all its disparate levels of activity and dysfunction, the GCC may be severely impaired but it is not yet ready to be dispatched to the dustbin of history.

But Nigeria’s heavy-handed military approach to fighting the group might still backfire. Find out more when you subscribe to World Politics Review (WPR). Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based jihadi movement affiliated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State, has been in decline since 2015, since it began to lose territory around Lake Chad under joint military pressure from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon. After retreating from major towns in northeastern Nigeria such as Bama and Mubi, Boko Haram now controls only certain remote rural areas in that corner of the country. But even though its strength peaked back in 2015, for Boko Haram, Nigeria and its neighbors are still a target, as the group’s decline has been uneven and frequently punctuated by shocking attacks.Consider the military situation on the ground. One recent study found that in 2016, Boko Haram attacks fell by 29 percent compared with 2015, and the group inflicted 73 percent fewer casualties. Data for northern Cameroon show that after two deadly winters — 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 — Boko Haram has been less powerful. In December 2016, Nigerian forces raided Boko Haram camps in Nigeria’s Sambisa forest, one of the sect’s last remaining bastions. Nevertheless, Boko Haram has repeatedly defied the Nigerian government’s claims that it is on the verge of defeat. Even with a weakened Boko Haram, Nigeria still faces a long fight to eradicate the group.

In 2016, a group of West African nations announced the creation of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNTJF), a coalition whose main mission is to fight the militant group Boko Haram. Nigeria, Chad, and Niger orginally founded the task force in 1998 to address banditry around Lake Chad, but as Boko Haram gained power, pressure grew to restructure the MNTJF. The task force now has approximately 9,000 total troops, but nevertheless it is primarily a political prop rather than an integrated military outfit. The region’s national militaries largely pursue their own campaigns, while the optics of regional integration serve a political purpose: They explicitly support narratives about so-called African solutions to African problems, yet implicitly facilitate greater Western involvement in the fight against Boko Haram, often on a bilateral rather than truly multilateral basis.

Sign me up today! As a significant military partner of Nigeria, the United States is one of those Western countries involved in the fight against Boko Haram. Yet, the U.S. has routinely turned a blind eye to abuses by the Nigerian military battling the group in the northeast of the country. So far, there is every indication that this bilateral military engagement will continue under President Donald Trump. A frequent refrain in Washington policy circles is that it is imperative to depend on “strategic regional partners” to advance America’s security objectives. But while security partnerships, both multilateral and bilateral, are a valuable component of America’s national security toolkit, events in the Lake Chad basin suggest that Washington’s strategic partners are engaging in counterproductive behavior. Military violence against civilians runs rampant in Nigeria’s battle against Boko Haram.

An ambush in October 2017 outside the village of Tongo Tongo in Niger killed four American soldiers, four Nigerien soldiers and one Nigerien translator. The deaths of the Americans brought an unprecedented level of scrutiny to U.S. military operations in West Africa’s Sahel region and on the continent at large. Though U.S. military engagement in Africa is growing rapidly, the extent of it is mostly unknown to the American public, and even to some lawmakers. This is in large part because the U.S. military obscures the nature of its actions in Africa through ambiguous language and outright secrecy. It limits the amount of information available about the objectives of its operations, how those operations are carried out, the facilities it uses, and how it partners with governments in the region. At times, this has involved subverting democratic processes in partner countries, an approach that runs counter to years of diplomatic engagement ostensibly designed to strengthen governance institutions.

https://medium.com/@wpr/there-is-no-strategic-rationale-for-trumps-appeasement-of-putin-65f24aac4d71?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"Everyone other than President Donald Trump’s most ardent loyalists considered his performance at — and after — the recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin a disaster. Standing beside one of America’s most skilled adversaries, Trump blasted his own domestic political opponents, while again adopting the language of dictators by calling the nonpartisan media “an enemy of the people.” He once again accepted Putin’s denial of Russian meddling in America’s 2016 election despite the U.S. intelligence community’s conviction that it happened. Instead of highlighting the deep policy differences between the United States and Russia, Trump adopted the Russian positions on what caused the deterioration of bilateral relations. And in stark contrast to the way he treated America’s close NATO allies a few days earlier, he lavished praise on Putin. Criticism was immediate and vociferous. CNN’s John King called the Helsinki meeting Trump’s “surrender summit.” Columnist Max Boot described it as the “sellout in Helsinki.” Sen. John McCain decried the post-summit press conference as “the most disgraceful performance by an American president in memory.” Former CIA Director John Brennan tweeted, “It was nothing short of treasonous.” One headline in particular stands out: a story by the New Yorker’s Robin Wright that referred to Helsinki as “Trump’s appeasement summit.” The use of the word “appeasement” is important. Often applied to then-British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlin’s approach to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, it is highly pejorative, suggesting a futile and misguided surrender to the demands of an aggressor. Calling a policy “appeasement” is intended to sting. In reality, though, appeasement can be a useful or at least necessary tool of statecraft. As George Liska, a major scholar of international relations, pointed out in his 1982 book about the Cold War, “Russia and the Road to Appeasement,” while stigmatized by its association with Chamberlin, appeasement under the right conditions can preserve order and avoid war between great powers. Given that, it is fair to ask whether Trump’s appeasement of Putin is, in fact, part of some broader strategy that promotes U.S. national interests. History offers clues, suggesting that appeasement only makes sense under certain conditions. First, the ambitions of the aggressor must be limited. This is why appeasing Hitler was misguided. Second, appeasement must be the lesser evil compared to the alternatives. Liska, writing as the Cold War had entered a dangerous new peak, believed that appeasing Moscow was less dangerous than further escalating America’s competition with the Soviet Union given the mounting disorder in what was then called the “Third World.” Third, appeasement can make sense as a method of buying time if the appeaser feels that the balance of power is shifting in its favor and it will be better able to stand up to the aggressor in the future. Fourth, appeasement makes sense if it is one part of a larger tradeoff: Some of the aggressor’s demands are met in exchange for concessions or cooperation on something else. Few of these conditions apply to Trump’s policy toward Russia. Certainly Putin’s ambitions are limited — he is not a Hitler who thinks that he can rule the world. But it is hard to imagine that appeasing Putin while slamming America’s steadfast NATO allies is a lesser evil than holding Russia accountable for its military intervention in Ukraine and meddling in Western democracies. There is no indication that the United States needs to buy time until it gets stronger — America has the upper hand now if Trump would only use his nation’s power. And while the Trump administration has dropped hints that appeasing Russia might get Putin’s help in forcing Iran to leave Syria or encouraging Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to make peace with his opponents, this pipedream wildly overestimates Russia’s interest in altering the political dynamics of the Middle East and its ability to do so. So while history suggests logical reasons for appeasing an adversary, none of them seem to apply to Putin and Russia. Put simply, there is no discernible strategic rationale for Trump’s appeasement of Putin. In a sense, though, this is not a new story. Even before Trump was inaugurated as president, Dominic Tierney wrote that his “Russia strategy is based on making a series of one-sided concessions in the hopes of luring Moscow into a more positive global relationship.” “A man who ran for office as the ultimate negotiator,” Tierney continued, “is intent on giving away the store.” How should we account for this? As Aaron Blake wrote in the Washington Post it is possible that Trump simply admires Putin’s strength and wants to be his friend. If so, throwing the U.S. intelligence community under the bus to curry favor with the Russian leader would seem to be an extreme, dangerous and even reprehensible way to impress him. Another explanation is that Trump seems to be a chronic contrarian with an obsessive need to do the opposite of what he’s advised to do. Since nearly everyone has suggested that he get tough on Russia, instead he decided to appease Putin. The most frightening explanation, though, is that Putin holds some sort of incriminating information about Trump. While this idea has been floated even before the 2016 election, Trump’s performance at Helsinki fueled speculation over it, leading two Democratic senators — Charles Schumer and Jeff Merkley — to openly suggest that it is the only logical explanation. What took place in Helsinki or its aftermath does not prove this theory, but Trump’s behavior is in no way inconsistent with it. Whether or not Putin has some sort of secret leverage over Trump, Aaron Blake was right when he wrote that “the more chatter there is about an American president being compromised,” the better it is for Russia. In these dangerous times, psychology rather than strategy seems to be driving America’s interaction with one of its most serious adversaries.

https://medium.com/@wpr/has-erdogans-attempt-to-reshape-turkish-society-hit-a-wall-80bada45433?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"A new mosque in traditional Ottoman style is currently being built in Istanbul’s central Taksim Square. Due to be completed later this year, it is just one of thousands of new mosques going up across Turkey. But the construction in Taksim is particularly symbolic — an apparent sign of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s conquest of the political landscape and ability to reshape the Turkish nation in line with his wishes. He is currently campaigning for snap presidential and parliamentary elections on June 24 in which he could further cement his grip. Despite a surprisingly energetic opposition campaign, Erdogan remains the odds-on favorite. But under the surface, things may not be so simple. Turkish society today is too sophisticated to be entirely reshaped by one man. While Erdogan and his party’s religious-nationalist program, combining modern Islamic conservatism with a populist streak heavy on Ottoman nostalgia, appears firmly in place today, there are growing signs that social tides in Turkey are not necessarily moving in the conservative direction that many assume. Taksim offers a useful window into why. Ever since it became a kind of stage for the Ottoman Empire’s modernization in the 19th century, generations of different ideological persuasions have sought to change the square in line with their worldview. In 1928, five years after the founding of the modern Republic of Turkey, the Republic Monument was constructed in Taksim, symbolizing founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s new nationalist order. The square was then subjected, in the 1930s and 1940s, to a comprehensive redesign by French urban planner Henri Prost, with large avenues, parks, promenades and modernist buildings encapsulating the secular spirit of the Kemalist cause. “Taksim is the representation of the liberal space and secularism,” Mucella Yapici, an architect at the Taksim Solidarity Platform, a coalition of interest groups, recently told a Turkish publication. Taksim is also loaded with significance among religious conservatives. The Gezi Park protests in the summer of 2013 were sparked in opposition to an Erdogan-backed plan to bulldoze the park and rebuild the Ottoman-era barracks that once stood in its place. Those barracks were particularly symbolic as they were the site of a late-Ottoman mutiny in 1909 against the second constitutional era. In his book, “Architecture and the Turkish City: An Urban History of Istanbul since the Ottomans,” Murat Gul, a professor at Istanbul Technical University, also describes how religious circles have “worked tirelessly since the 1950s to have a mosque constructed in the square,” believing it “would be a stamp of Islamic identity on Taksim and provide a psychological victory for the political Islamist movement.” So the new mosque under construction today represents Erdogan’s fulfillment of a long-held desire for Turkish Islamists. On the opposite side of the square, the government is also overseeing the demolition and rebuilding of the Ataturk Culture Center, an iconic republican-era opera house. Through the two projects, Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, is making a statement about where authority lies in Turkey’s largest city. A few days ago, the president himself made a midnight visit to observe the site of the under-construction mosque and the demolished culture center. And it isn’t just Istanbul; Erdogan towers over all areas of life in the country. State institutions, which throughout modern Turkish history have often been bitterly contested by different ideological factions, have gradually been subordinated to Erdogan’s will since he first came to office in 2003 as prime minister and especially since he became president in 2014. Erdogan is almost constantly on television, often delivering three pugnacious speeches in one day, all of which are broadcast live on every news channel. Under the ongoing state of emergency, declared after the attempted military coup in July 2016, he has been able to govern through decrees granted the full force of the law. His supporters refer to him as “reis,” or chief. The government’s attempts to mold Turkish society according to the AKP’s ideals have in recent years moved into education, family and cultural policy. Money has poured into the Directorate of Religious Affairs, or Diyanet, which promotes an orthodox Sunni understanding across Turkey and now has an annual budget of over 4 billion Turkish liras (about $890 million), dwarfing most other ministries. Erdogan has famously declared his aim to “raise pious generations.” In classic, right-wing populist fashion, he frames this as a return to a more authentic and harmonious Turkish order, denouncing liberal and secular currents as alien and unwelcome impositions. But despite the AKP being at the apogee of its power, longer-term trends suggest that Turkish society may not be heading inexorably down a homogenous Islamist path. Many in Turkey’s conservative media were recently preoccupied by intense debate about a rising number of young conservative Turks moving away from traditional Islamic beliefs. Their alarm focuses on a report in early April prepared by the local branch of the Education Ministry in the central Anatolian province of Konya. Conducted among students at state religious schools, known as imam-hatip schools, the survey warns that “youths are sliding to deism,” referring to belief in a God who does not intervene in worldly matters. Questioning their faith and troubled by “inconsistencies” in traditional Islamic beliefs, many young Turks are reported to be leaning toward a more personal and less institutional understanding of religion. Similar accounts from religious constituencies across Turkey since April have appeared, leading to a flurry of alarmed commentary in conservative media outlets. The “deism” phenomenon may be exaggerated, but the fact it has stirred up such concern indicates a profound insecurity among Turkey’s Islamists. Despite generous funding and incentives, the newly opened religious schools are under-performing and under-enrolled compared to traditional, nonreligious schools. Encouraged by the gravitational force of urbanization, the birth rate in Turkey has been steadily falling despite Erdogan’s personal push for women to have “at least three children.” And divorce rates, while still very low compared to the European average, are rising every year. A recent survey conducted by the Center for American Progress and the Turkish pollster Metropoll found that younger Turks, including AKP supporters, are less likely to say Islam is central to their life and conception of “Turkishness.” And while the government constantly emphasizes the importance of “native and national” production, Turkey’s economy remains highly dependent on foreign capital inflows, resulting in a persistently high current account deficit. As throughout Turkish history, ideological ideals have hit the wall of reality under Erdogan and the AKP. Erdogan remains immensely popular and seems on course to retain the presidency in the upcoming elections, even if the race is tighter than many expected. Backed by the full force of the state, his brand of religious-nationalist conservatism looks set to dominate Turkey’s politics for the foreseeable future. But the vaunted social revolution ushered in by the AKP is not as deep as many observers inside and outside the country reckon. Just as no government has ever been able to completely reshape Taksim Square as it wishes, state attempts to engineer Turkish society, going back to Ataturk, have typically had only a limited effect. It may take years to fully realize the limits of the current government’s conservative social project, but the signs are starting to appear.

https://medium.com/@wpr/why-narendra-modi-and-xi-jinping-made-nice-at-asias-other-landmark-summit-b4a14247bcb8?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"The historic inter-Korean summit on April 27 drew global attention, but it overshadowed another important meeting that began the same day between two other neighbors in Asia with their own fraught history. Billed as an “informal summit” between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan, China, it was a welcome development in their strained relationship that revealed the domestic priorities driving both countries in the short term, as well as the strategic undercurrents that are shaping the Asia-Pacific. Modi’s visit to the central Chinese city of Wuhan was seen by some as an effort to “reset” relations between Asia’s two great powers. While the summit produced little to recalibrate the strategic fault lines between India and China, it appears to have succeeded in lowering temperatures and creating space to improve ties after a tumultuous 2017, when India and China engaged in their most fractious border confrontation in decades. Their standoff in the remote Himalayan region of Doklam was the first time India confronted China over a border disputed by a third country, with India claiming to stand up to China on behalf of Bhutan. Both sides’ rhetoric, but especially China’s, was alarmingly hawkish, raising the stakes. Though the confrontation did not escalate and the two sides agreed to fall back, Sino-Indian relations had clearly entered a more fraught phase, with India prepared to counter China’s moves in its neighborhood and around the Indian Ocean. It is remarkable, then, that less than a year later, Xi and Modi were praising the other’s country and resolving to work together to “play a very positive role for peace, stability and prosperity in the world,” as Modi stated in his effusive speech in Wuhan. India and China proved they have the diplomatic capabilities and political wherewithal to manage crises, avoid conflict and repair ties, despite antagonistic sentiments at home. This turnaround was engineered through months of diplomacy. Though they stood down at Doklam ahead of Modi’s visit to China last September for the BRICS summit, both countries continued to amass forces near the disputed mountain pass. Maintaining regular diplomatic engagement became critical and ultimately made the Wuhan summit possible. In February, India’s foreign secretary visited China, followed by India’s national security adviser and foreign and defense ministers in April. This pattern of high-level engagement has been characteristic of the Modi-Xi era, often involving the leaders themselves, who have now formally met 13 times. Modi is scheduled to return to China again in June for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Qingdao. Beyond this diplomatic engagement, New Delhi and Beijing have exercised greater care in how they’ve handled sensitive issues, which has lowered tensions. In March, for example, the Indian government told its senior officials not to participate in events honoring the Dalai Lama’s 60 years of exile in India out of deference to Chinese sensitivities. Beijing, for its part, has made conciliatory proposals to reinitiate military exchanges and start a joint trilateral economic corridor with Nepal. Though no major agreements were reached at the Wuhan summit, Modi and Xi announced a number of confidence-building measures and proposals for more cooperation, which reportedly included issuing guidance to their militaries to reduce tensions at the border. They are also considering joint economic development projects in Afghanistan as a way to build trust. Prior to the summit, the two foreign ministers agreed that China would resume sharing data about the Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers, both of which originate in China, to help India predict flooding in its northeast. They also declared that the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra — a religious pilgrimage for Indians through the Natha La Route in Tibet — will resume this year after China shut it down after the Doklam standoff. Furthermore, China announced that it would exempt 28 Indian prescription drugs from import tariffs. This was a small yet tangible concession that India had been clamoring for, due to its large trade imbalance with China. It was a signal, perhaps, that Beijing is serious about addressing Indian concerns. But given the rancor of the past two years, capped by the Doklam dispute, why did both countries ultimately blink? First, it seems, there was a realization that things had gone too far at Doklam. While India and China have not made progress on the intractable issues at the border, both understand that a real conflict is not in their interest. Domestic pressures were also at play, pushing Beijing and New Delhi to seek accommodation. India’s parliamentary elections next year are Modi’s top priority, and he is keen to avoid any international embarrassments or entanglements that might undermine his campaign for a second term. Though still the favorite, Modi is not expected to repeat his dominant electoral performance from 2014. Several analysts have noted that Modi went to Wuhan in part to gain assurances that China would not engage in provocations before the elections. For Xi, after consolidating power, his top priority remains China’s economic transformation. Facing international trade pressure, especially from the United States under the Trump administration, Xi may be eager to minimize other fissures abroad in order to focus on his economic agenda. Finally, broader strategic considerations played a role in India and China coming together, with the U.S. being the elephant in the room. Despite announcing a new Indo-Pacific strategy late last year, Washington still lacks a coherent policy for the region. President Donald Trump has hurt America’s international credibility and created global leadership vacuums through his decisions to pull out of international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris Agreement on climate change and now the Iran nuclear deal. Further complicating matters, the world has seen steady turnover in the Trump administration’s national security personnel and in its positions on critical issues, suggesting to partners and rivals alike that Washington isn’t reliable. At Wuhan, the world witnessed India and China hedging because of this vast uncertainty created by the United States. With Trump threatening a potential trade war, Beijing is keen to smooth relations and economic ties with its neighbors. It has been wary of the growing U.S.-India bonhomie over the past few years, but with the U.S. now acting unpredictably — preoccupied with North Korea and soon to face the consequences of breaking the Iran nuclear deal — Beijing senses an opportunity to ease India’s drift into the U.S. camp. Under Modi, India has taken bold steps it knew would frustrate China. It outlined more robust outreach to East Asian nations, began echoing American concerns about freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, confronted China at Doklam, and agreed to resuscitate quadrilateral dialogue with the U.S., Australia and Japan. But today, with American credibility damaged and its commitment to the liberal international order, as well as to its defense network and alliances in Asia, suddenly up in the air, India is wary about going further down that path. Modi is likely to move more cautiously, and normalizing relations with China is a critical component of that calculus. While domestic priorities and geopolitical dynamics coalesced late last month in Wuhan, it was only the start of a process. As Shivshankar Menon, India’s previous national security adviser, noted, the Wuhan summit “is a useful step” and “a signal, but it is not the new strategic framework” needed for a longer-term rapprochement. That must wait — to see if this calm with China holds until India’s elections, and whether policies and actions reflect the positive tone set in Wuhan.

Whether it’s exploring new hobbies, reading up on current events, or simply asking questions, cultivating a mindset of curiosity can lead to a more fulfilling and enriching life. The fine art of curiosity is something that can be practiced and honed over time. It involves being open to new experiences, seeking out knowledge, and asking questions without fear of judgment or embarrassment. Curiosity is the driving force behind learning. It is the desire to know more, to understand the world around us, and to seek out new experiences. Without curiosity, we would never explore, discover, or innovate. At its core, curiosity is about asking questions. It’s about being open-minded and willing to explore new ideas and perspectives. It’s about being willing to challenge your own assumptions and beliefs and to seek out new information that can broaden your understanding of the world. Curiosity is not just about acquiring knowledge, however. It’s also about developing a mindset that is open to learning and growth. It’s about being willing to take risks, to make mistakes, and to learn from them. It’s about being willing to step outside of your comfort zone and try new things, even if they are unfamiliar or challenging. To cultivate a lifelong learning mindset, it’s important to nurture your curiosity. This means being intentional about seeking out new experiences, exploring new ideas, and asking questions. It means being willing to embrace uncertainty and to approach the world with a sense of wonder and awe. In short, the essence of curiosity is about being open to the world, willing to learn, and eager to explore. By embracing this mindset, we can unlock new opportunities for growth, discovery, and fulfillment in our lives. "

I had just come back as a digital nomad from Asia and didn’t pay close enough attention to my business finances. I had taken on too much. Overspent. And had a massive tax liability that could ruin me. I remember sitting in my hostel in Cambodia crying. I felt like I was fu*ked. When I got back to Melbourne, I went to bed every night in March and April with anxiety. I had an elevated heart rate most of the time. Fast forward 6 months, and I am in a completely different position. I am now cracking more than $20k per month. Here’s what I did. Whenever I found myself overwhelmed, I asked myself one question: I would identify the highest-leverage task and give it my full attention. This would force me to suspend my anxiety and stress and just get to work. I am surprised by how effective it was. Almost a form of productive mindfulness. It radically shortcuts my action threshold. Instead of procrastinating I’m feeling overwhelmed or wallowing in my stress, I managed to knock off task after task. After a full day of action-focused problem-solving, I would end up solving lots of problems. Solve what’s in front of you, and the next step becomes easier.

Like this little gem: And this: And this: Need I say more? Not really but I will, not for my own benefit but because I would be doing Carl Jung an injustice. So, here goes. Here’s the best of Carl Jung — condensed into tiny sentences. There are many groups of people who love to dish out name tags, job titles, and labels. But it takes a brave soul to look within, ask questions, listen to their intuition, and seek refuge in their own heart. It takes a brave soul but the alternative doesn’t bear thinking about.

After all, we spend every moment of our lives with our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. But do we really know ourselves? It’s a question that has puzzled philosophers, psychologists, and everyday people alike. One reason why it’s difficult to answer this question is that we are constantly changing. Our personalities, beliefs, and values can shift over time, influenced by our environment, relationships, and life experiences. What we thought we knew about ourselves at one point in our lives may no longer be true. Additionally, we may have blind spots or biases that prevent us from seeing ourselves clearly. Despite these challenges, there are ways to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. Through introspection, reflection, and seeking feedback from others, we can uncover our strengths, weaknesses, and motivations. By doing so, we can make more informed decisions, build better relationships, and live more fulfilling lives. As humans, we often ask ourselves the question, “Do we know ourselves?” The concept of self is complex and multifaceted, and understanding it is crucial to our personal growth and development. At its core, the concept of self refers to our individual identity, which is shaped by a variety of factors such as our experiences, beliefs, values, and emotions. Our self-concept influences how we see ourselves and how we interact with the world around us. Self-awareness is a critical component of understanding the concept of self. It involves being conscious of our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they impact our lives. Another important aspect of the concept of self is self-esteem. This refers to how we feel about ourselves and our abilities. Having healthy self-esteem is essential for our mental and emotional well-being, as it allows us to feel confident and capable in our lives. "

Back then, if I found myself in a heated argument, surrounded by a group of close friends, it was seen as a display of courage to stand my ground. I dared to stir up trouble, almost a badge of honor. Fast forward to today, I approach conflicts with a sense of maturity. I’ve learned to avoid unnecessary confrontations, as I’m conscious of how my friends might perceive me. The fear of being ridiculed or judged has replaced the bravado of my youth. Ten years ago, I would revel in heavy drinking sessions, belting out songs at the karaoke bar, and making the most of late nights. I had a reputation for knowing how to have a good time. Nowadays, my priorities have shifted. I find fulfillment in working with integrity, living a more low-key lifestyle, taking care of household responsibilities, and spending quality time with my family. This transformation is regarded as reliable and responsible, no matter how successful or wealthy I may be. Ten years ago, my temper was a force to be reckoned with. Once I got angry, it was like trying to stop a charging bull. Ten years later, I’ve developed better emotional control. When anger flares up, I quickly realize its futility, and it dissipates as swiftly as it arose. Time has taught me the value of emotional restraint. In my younger years, even the smallest sentimental moments would profoundly impact me. Now, as I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to bear pain and sadness in silence. I’ve discovered that sometimes, the depth of pain is best expressed in silence, and it’s a mark of inner strength. Ten years ago, I often pretended to understand things I didn’t, masking my confusion with a facade of knowledge. Ten years later, I’ve embraced humility. I may still pretend to be puzzled sometimes, but it’s a way of acknowledging that I’m continually learning and growing. Life has taught me the importance of staying open to new knowledge. Regardless of the reasons behind it, the twists and turns in my life journey, the ups… "

However, ignoring fear causes the walls to close in. It is not the end of the world if you make mistakes. If you’re not interested in your work or looking for a challenge, you’re probably bored. People who are curious about something try to pass their time. Find something that excites you once more and get back in touch with your hobbies. It’s time to refocus if you find yourself stuck to your phone all day, missing deadlines, and losing track of your goals. Focus on your goals for the future before returning to your current goals. Find new ones if they aren’t inspiring you anymore. If you ignore difficult tasks, put in just the right amount of hours at work, and have a small group of friends, you’re placing comfort above future advancement.

The air became crisper as the jeep was climbing higher, the landscape turned into lush green canvas that is painted with myriad of trees and wildflowers. The air was filled with the fragrance of pine trees. I felt as if I am ascending to a totally different world. Silence, tranquility, serenity was all around me. I was left spellbound the moment I reached Paye Meadows. The initial spot where jeep ride ends is full of tourists enjoying snacks and tea.

Memorable and catchy typography can make a website pop, keeping users hooked and engaged with products and offers. Typography Influences Decision Making: Ever picked a wine just because the label was fancy? Bet a savvy design played a part! Cool typography isn’t just about looking good; it’s the magic that brings a brand to life, sets the mood, and convinces you that you need that thing right now. It’s basically design wizardry! Establishes hierarchy: Imagine typography as the superhero sidekick for graphic designers. It guides your eyes on a webpage, making sure you notice the important stuff, like headings and details. Check out Vlow’s website – it’s like a party! Bold fonts make sure you see who they are, and even with a wild video, the text steals the show. It’s like a comic book adventure – the call-to-action button is the hero waiting for you to join the fun. Shows personality: Personality is a significant part of the design elements representing a brand’s identity. The colors and typefaces of the words on Vlow’s website communicate the brand’s fun, hip personality. But that sort of typography wouldn’t suit a brand like Wabimento, a funeral services provider catering to people grieving the loss of a loved one. To give visitors a sense of Wabimento’s gentle, comforting personality, Webflow designer Roem chose a delicate typeface that communicates its message softly, perfectly complementing the website’s soothing images. Sets the tone: Typography sets the tone for a campaign, using visual elements to create a sense of urgency, excitement, calmness, or whatever emotion will help the content resonate with viewers. For SkillsNow, an HR and training app, designer James Wood used color to position the drab, single-toned status quo, “skills management,” against the future, with a bright gradient for the word “re-imagined,” setting a hopeful tone that inspires visitors to imagine what’s possible.

Let’s take a look. Example 1: Pretty bad Going to a happy hour with a bunch of iffy people. Low return on investment. There are much better ways to spend 2–3 hours. Example 2: A fucking nightmare Getting blackout drunk and missing the whole next day. A negative return on investment. You’ll never get that time back and you got literally nothing out of it except a day of feeling like shit, by your own doing. Enough negative though. Let’s take a look at some of the most positive things you can do for yourself. Set aside sacred time. Mine is 6–9 every morning. That’s 21 hours a week. Imagine what you could do with 1,092 hours a year. Put your phone away when you work. Turn on some classical music. Ask your family to leave you alone. Forget social media exists (unless you’re working on there). Sleep at least 7 hours per night. Preferably 8 or 9. Take naps. Have some downtime. Don’t buy into the hustle-and-grind culture. Sure, you should work but have time blocks. I do most of my side hustle work from 6a-9a, 7 days a week. 21 hours is plenty. I’m avoiding burnout at all costs. That’ll only set me back. Lift weights at least 3x per week. If you have to choose between cardio and lifting because you’re strapped for time, pick weightlifting. And lift things that are (relatively) heavy. It’s not just good for your body, it’s great for your mind. Prioritize good health, because little else matters without it. Different than exercise, yes. Walk 10k+ steps a day, preferably in nature. Because then you get double the points. Try sprinting once or twice a week, on a grassy hill if you can. It’s a lower impact, and easier on the joints. Car pushing is another low-impact, high-intensity way to… "

I had just come back as a digital nomad from Asia and didn’t pay close enough attention to my business finances. I had taken on too much. Overspent. And had a massive tax liability that could ruin me. I remember sitting in my hostel in Cambodia crying. I felt like I was fu*ked. When I got back to Melbourne, I went to bed every night in March and April with anxiety. I had an elevated heart rate most of the time. Fast forward 6 months, and I am in a completely different position. I am now cracking more than $20k per month. Here’s what I did. Whenever I found myself overwhelmed, I asked myself one question: I would identify the highest-leverage task and give it my full attention. This would force me to suspend my anxiety and stress and just get to work. I am surprised by how effective it was. Almost a form of productive mindfulness. It radically shortcuts my action threshold. Instead of procrastinating I’m feeling overwhelmed or wallowing in my stress, I managed to knock off task after task. After a full day of action-focused problem-solving, I would end up solving lots of problems. Solve what’s in front of you, and the next step becomes easier.

Here’s the best of Carl Jung — condensed into tiny sentences. There are many groups of people who love to dish out name tags, job titles, and labels. But it takes a brave soul to look within, ask questions, listen to their intuition, and seek refuge in their own heart. It takes a brave soul but the alternative doesn’t bear thinking about.

It’ll tell you lies, it’ll keep you distracted and it’ll ensure your day is never yours. Evolution hasn’t caught up to our modern days. Most of us are still at the mercy of our more primitive mindset. Or as my girlfriend calls it “my little goldfish brain”. Let’s get you beyond that. Discipline, new mental models, new habits…these don’t form overnight. Catch yourself slipping and readjust real time. Persistent people understand discipline is like a muscle. Keep working it and you get stronger. Look at things from multiple angles, put yourself in others’ shoes, be open to changing your mind, always think in terms of how many options you have. Life is not black and white. It’s mostly gray areas. Try new things, push your comfort boundaries, stop overthinking and just start doing. You need to be smart about it, but risk-taking is part of success in life. Have fun with the world around you. Stop to take in small bits of wonder. Example, the golden tree in my backyard blowing in the breeze. It had me mesmerized a few weeks ago, before winter really hit and took it away. Use all of your senses, pay attention to the world around you, see patterns and how things really work vs. how you want them to work. Data tells you the truth even when your feelings want to lie to you. Understand your limitations, recognize when you get pessimistic, catch patterns. Meditation helps. You can learn to spot your thoughts and let them go. Clarity is the goal when it comes to thinking. Stop thinking about being understood and worry more about understanding those around you. I love the saying “You have 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason”. Listen twice as much as you speak. Learn to take a moment. Don’t fall for “act now” schemes. Create a plan so you can calmly follow it. Example- with investments I don’t get too high or too low. They go up and down but my plan remains the same. I buy assets every 2 weeks and ignore the markets in between.

Too many people seem to use money in ways that create problems, stress, and headaches. Money can be a wonderful tool, but only if you use it to simplify your life (not complicate it). Stop making unforced errors. Spend to simplify. Life definitely isn't fair. It's a troubling reality. But instead of wasting energy on every obstacle in your way, focus on what you can control and how you can break through. Stop looking out. Look in. Be accountable. Own your shit. In his 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech, Steve Jobs talked about having faith that the dots will somehow connect in your life. You take daily actions with complete uncertainty. Faith in the dots allows you to persevere and endure the uncertainty. Your 80-year-old self cares about the long-term compounding of the decisions of today. Your 10-year-old self reminds you to stay foolish and have some fun along the way. If you have the good fortune to be wealthy and successful in life, always be sure to share it with others. Support your family and friends when you're able. Give with no expectation of return. Always give more than you receive. My 30-for-30 approach: You were made to move.

This is an elite list for a reason, and you don’t need to follow it to the tee, especially if you’re a straight baby back bitch. Let’s go: Beyond the joys of witnessing the slow stirring of life in the early morning, sunrises and gaining back more time, there is a powerful sense of ownership that comes from getting up early. Generals with donkey nuts get up before their slumbering armies, just like you emerge before anyone else. Doing things that elite people do instantly makes you elite. You embody the figure of a leader. Wake when it’s dark. Your life will change. Don’t whine, just do this tomorrow. The temptations can be huge, and I get it. But you sabotage your success greatly if you fiddle your Jimmy Jangler or watch Sally shaking her milkers on Wimp Hub. The benefits of quitting are documented and monumental over the longer term. Handling your sexual urges is the foundational habit that transfers into all other disciplines. Elite men can say no to pussy handed to them on a plate or screen. The key part (the secret) is semen retention, which I attribute to my most successful phases in life. It also makes you live longer. You needn’t stop sleeping with women to retain. Learn more about tantric sex and dry orgasm. Beer might seem manly, and there’s a sentimentality to the idea of men drinking alcohol. Cool, but it will also cloud your mind, make you depressed, and give you bitch tits. Same with drugs, and don’t give me that shit about how it ‘eases your anxiety’ — it’s all an excuse and makes it worse. So just quit entirely, even when it’s Christmas. Be boring as F.

When faced with something challenging or stressful, they tend to throw up resistance. It’s almost like dealing with a stubborn, spoiled child. When things get tough, that inner child awakens, and suddenly, the procrastination monster rears its head. Imagine your brain as that child who complains and throws a tantrum when things don’t go their way. The same happens when you’re faced with difficult tasks — your mind starts to procrastinate, making it even harder to take action. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Mindset plays a pivotal role in conquering these challenges. Let me share a real-life example with you. One of my Friends During his medical school clinical rotations, had to step out of my comfort zone often. Giving lectures, performing procedures, and breaking tough news to families were no easy feats. I had a friend who seemed to take it all in stride, unbothered by mistakes or setbacks. Curious about her secret, I asked her how she managed it. And you know what she said? She wasn’t even thinking about stepping out of her comfort zone. For her, it was all about having fun and immersing herself in the learning process, treating it like a game. Isn’t that fascinating? By taking the pressure off her ego and simply enjoying the tasks, she managed to push through the resistance and excel in her endeavors. Your brain is wired to protect you, just like a parent looking out for their child. When stress or difficulty comes knocking, your brain’s automatic reaction is to resist, to avoid discomfort. But here’s the thing: Understanding this response is the first step towards embracing that “spoiled child” within you. Instead of fighting it, let’s figure out how to work together with your brain. One fantastic strategy to outsmart your brain is the “Two-Minute Rule.” Imagine facing a daunting task, and the thought of diving into it feels overwhelming. Instead of putting intense pressure on yourself to complete the whole thing at once, lower the barrier to entry. Tell yourself, “Hey, I’m just going to spend two minutes on this.” Bold move, right? Those two minutes will feel like a piece of cake. And you know what? More often than not, once you start, you’ll find yourself surprisingly motivated to keep going. Now, let’s take it to the next level. Breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps is key. Picture this: you need to tackle a big project that seems like a mountain to climb. Your brain instantly panics, imagining the sheer effort required. But wait! Take a deep breath and break it down into bite-sized pieces. Divide and conquer, my friend! Start by outlining the first step, then the second, and so on. Suddenly, that overwhelming mountain turns into a series of smaller hills you can easily conquer. This will only be possible if you are consistent thought, if you keep piling up everything then I guess you need a different strategy. That little voice inside your head shapes how you see yourself and what you believe you’re capable of. But here’s the thing: your ego can either be your biggest cheerleader or your toughest critic when it comes to tackling challenges. Well, your ego’s job is to protect your self-image, and how you see yourself. So, when faced with something that feels outside your comfort zone, it might resist, not wanting to risk any “damage” to that self-image. Here’s a little trick to tame that ego and make it your ally: change the way you talk to yourself. Language is a powerful tool, my friend! Instead of saying, “I need to do this,” try this on for size: “I am someone who does this.” Bold move, right? By aligning your actions with your identity, you create harmony between what you do and how you perceive yourself. So, next time you face a tough task, tell yourself, “I am someone who tackles challenges head-on!” Your ego will be nodding in approval. When you consistently act in ways that align with your desired self-image, something magical happens. Your ego starts to notice, and it’s like, “Hey, this is who we are!” Let me share a personal example: When I started hitting the gym regularly, I had this vision of being a fit and healthy person. So, every time I worked out, I reminded myself, “I am someone who prioritizes fitness.” And guess what? Over time, my self-image transformed. Do you know what makes tackling those challenging tasks even more exciting? Rewarding yourself along the way! That’s right — using the power of positive reinforcement can be a game-changer when it comes to boosting your motivation and making hard work feel like a breeze. Knowing that once you’re done, there’s a delightful reward waiting for you — a delicious treat, a movie night, or maybe some well-deserved me-time. Positive reinforcement is like a pat on the back from your own cheer squad. It tells your brain, “Hey, you’re doing a great job!” And that’s all it takes to keep that motivation engine running full speed ahead. But this needs discipline. Okay, here’s the secret sauce: pairing hard work with enjoyable activities. Think of it as a balanced meal for your brain. When you have something to look forward to after conquering a challenging task, it feels like a fun game, not a burden. Let’s get real with a relatable example: Imagine you’ve got a demanding work deadline. Instead of just stressing over it, create a plan. Tell yourself, “If I finish this task, I’ll treat myself to a little dance party or a short walk in the park.” Remember, it’s not about having everything figured out from the start. It’s about taking one step at a time, learning along the way, and embracing the journey. Every small improvement is a victory, and those add up to something remarkable. You only have to become closer to 1% better each time. Consistency is the key to turning your goals into reality. It’s like watering a plant every day to watch it grow. So, create a routine that aligns with your goals and stick to it like glue. Here’s a personal example: When I wanted to improve my writing skills, I committed to writing for at least 30 minutes every morning. At first, it was tough, but the more I stuck to my routine, the easier it became. Before I knew it, writing became second nature, and my skills soared. Surround yourself with people and resources that lift you up. A supportive environment can make all the difference in your journey. If you want to eat healthier, keep your kitchen stocked with nutritious options. If you aim to exercise regularly, join a fitness class with like-minded individuals. Your environment can be your greatest cheerleader. But again it all boils down to one thing, and that is staying Disciplined. Without this, you only have the raw brain power and no plan to follow. Also if you really hate what you are currently doing, then this entire piece of text is worthless. Anyways, Thanks for taking the time to read this article!

I think most people are that way. I remember when my first book, Trust Me I’m Lying, came out I was probably 10% proud of what I’d done and 90% eagerly awaiting for the first week sales to tell me the rest of how proud I should be. It was interminable, waiting to find out if I hit the bestseller lists. But as I’ve gone on, I’ve become less and less this way. It was a slow shift, I think, the product of getting skunked on the list more than a couple times. A result of realizing, as most creators eventually do, that sometimes the thing you think is your best work does the worst, and the thing you threw together in a few minutes suddenly does millions of views or outsells everything else. I have this recurring image that plays in my mind these days, especially when I am working on a book or a particularly difficult article. I’d close my eyes, think about the project, and there it would be. The image is of an unidentifiable baseball player at the plate. It’s zoomed in like one of those SportsCenter closeups, and the batter is already mid-swing and connecting with the ball. It’s one of those beautiful, old-timey swings like Mickey Mantle or Ted Williams used to take. The front leg extended, the back leg all the way back, the bat coming up and hitting the ball perfectly. That’s it. That’s the whole image. I don’t see where the ball goes, whether it was a base hit or a grand slam. I suspect earlier in my career, I would have cared about the outcome. I would have cared about who the player was and what team he played for. I would have needed to know whether the ball went foul or found a fielder’s mitt or cleared the upper deck. But as I have gotten better as a writer, paradoxically, it doesn’t even occur to me that such a thing would matter. The image is just the connection. The bat meeting the ball. The thing that is supposed to be all but physically impossible — hitting a rock coming at 90 miles per hour, that traveled from an elevated mound down to the batter in less than 400 milliseconds. Over and over again. The connection. "

I never thought my journey of losing 56 pounds would significantly impact people (30 pounds tracked — proof here). What started as me getting my health in order ended with readers finding inspiration in a rather substantial 12-month overhaul. I feel responsible for sharing as many nuanced details as possible because my journey is relatable to so many people. My daily routine of hitting the snooze button, rushing to work without a packed lunch, resorting to vending machine snacks, feeling drained after work, talking myself out of the gym and then hitting the pillow with the guilt tax of underachievement nagging away at me was an exhausting cycle. It’s one I hear many of you resonating with. There’s nothing extraordinary here. I’m just an ordinary bloke, and if this can happen for me, it can happen for you, too — no doubt about it. You can have and deserve the satisfaction of feeling at ease without worrying about slipping up, disappointing yourself, or having doubts like, “What if it doesn’t work for me?” It’s time to subtly take control and point your ocean liner a notch in the right direction because you haven’t got to make radical changes. You haven’t gotta survive on celery sticks, run marathons, or lift weights like a powerlifter to achieve your dream body. "

We get her up at 11 am and she spends most of the day in front of a TV, watching film noir. She is 80 years-old and no longer talks, or disagrees with things. Years earlier, she was a disagreeable sort –it was common to see her engaged in all kinds of debate, whether who was the best cooking chef on TV, (Julia Child or the Galloping Gourmet), or who was the most sophisticated actress of all time? Sophia Loren, or Audrey Hepburn? She was always full of words, and advice. Now, she sits and says nothing. I don’t know what ‘s worse –noticing the silence in the room or seeing the peeling white paint in the room. Her eyes water sometimes, and there is a dry cough-remnants of a receding flu. I hand her a drink of coffee, and she looks at me and then stares ahead–saying nothing. I mimic the gestures of putting the cup to my mouth, take a sip, and hope she watches me. I hand her the mug again, and this time, she hits my hand sharply and says “No!” It’s the first word she’s spoken in ages and I sit back, noticing my face flush and something on my hand. Her fingernail cuts me a little and blood trickles out, bit by bit until it stops. Onscreen, the protagonist holds up a precious falcon sculpture and says in the black and white movie, The Maltese Falcon, this is the “ stuff that dreams are made of.” I think of my own dreams, one that isn’t a valuable piece of art.

If taking care of yourself means letting someone down, then let me someone down. You don't lose real friends, real opportunities or real relationships when you start standing up for yourself and setting clear boundaries. You lose abusers, manipulators, narcissists, attention seekers and mental health-destroying leeches. "

I used to play hurling, but now I stick to running because I enjoy the feeling of completing a run. Looking back two years, I made a risky choice to stop taking my medication and started running four times a week. I even signed up for the Clontarf half marathon, aiming to finish in under 1 hour and 30 minutes. I also took on the Clondalkin half marathon. I pushed myself hard during training, and the excitement after each run became addictive. Despite some awareness that I might be pushing too far, the thrill of setting personal records, like finishing the Clondalkin half marathon in 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 21 seconds, kept me going. Things took a turn after completing a 5k parkrun in under 19 minutes. I started feeling overly confident, signalling potential danger. With the Clontarf half marathon approaching, I had irrational thoughts of breaking the world record with a 56-minute finish. How crazy is that? On race day, my delusions peaked, believing I embodied an ancient Irish ancestor. Realising I wasn't well, a voice urged me to seek help. My wife, waiting at the finish line, got worried when I didn't show up. At home, the situation escalated, and neighbours called the police due to my erratic behaviour. After this challenging time, a moment of clarity allowed me to function again. I resumed my medication, vowing not to stop again. While I still crave the positive feeling running gives me, I recognise the importance of staying on my medication for mental health. After a year without running, I've cautiously reintroduced it into my routine, making sure to stay committed to my medication to protect against the unpredictable challenges of mania. "

I have a 5-bedroom house, a perfect girlfriend, and a lot of work / entrepreneurial experience, and I am healthy and above-average fit. And while I am down 25k with my NFT investments over the last year, IF there is a new bull market, I will probably cash out 100k. For all the people that think there won’t be a new bull market and that NFTs are a scam. You might be right.

The hard decision is always the best decision, is a quote I have heard a lot. First, I didn’t know what it meant. This article is an attempt to bring meaning to it and might change your perspective about your daily choices. Every action you take is a decision. It can either be a hard decision or an easy one. Let’s define a hard decision as a decision that is hard to execute at the moment but, if done, brings you closer to your goals and makes your situation better. When it is done, you are glad you did it. Taking the night off and watching Netflix is a decision. It is a decision based on comfort, weakness, and the desire to pass the time away without any effort and to escape reality. Don’t get me wrong. I am not against taking rest and focusing on recovery, here is a blog I wrote about it. Let’s assume that you come home from work, are tired, and decide that focusing on recovery is your priority number 1. Your kitchen is a mess, and the laundry still has to be done. You contemplate if you should do the household tasks, go for a walk, meditate, write in your diary and go to sleep early (hard decision), or watch Netflix while drinking a beer and postponing your tasks till the next day (weak decision). BOTH choices help you with recovery, but one helps you more than the other. The hard decision takes more energy and willpower at the start, but the day after, you have a clean house, and you are better recovered. Hence, it is the best decision. But the other decision, watching Netflix and drinking beer, takes less willpower and energy at the moment. Of course, YOU choose to do your tasks and go to sleep early, but most people watch Netflix instead while forgetting the time and going to sleep too late… The more weak decisions you make, the worse you are off.

https://medium.com/@juanky006/3-ways-to-make-real-friends-69e1405d204?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"This blog post is about 3 ways to make real friends. Here, you will 3 of the best tips to make friends so you don’t waste your time in meaningless relationships and can make someone like you. Have you ever wondered how some people effortlessly manage to get so many friends? I bet you have been in a social situation, you try to introduce yourself to people, and talk for a bit, but then the person you are talking to decides to talk to someone else. To make things worse there is this guy or girl who is always surrounded by people no matter where they go. They want to be their friend. They don't even need to approach people: they get approached because their vibe is so nice. How is it that no matter how hard you try you can never make a real connection? Here are 3 tips to increase your chances of making more sincere friends. When I first started college, I thought the key to making friends and being the center of attention was to talk and talk and talk. So, I would walk up to people and try to fill the conversation with any thought that came to my mind. In turn, people avoided talking to me. Everything changed when I started focusing on being interested in the other person and asking questions. I would try to ask a question because I was curious. This made people really happy as they were talking about themselves and the conversation became engaging. I would ask where they come from, why they were doing what they were doing, and many more things I was curious about. The friends I have to this day are those that I met by asking questions instead of me trying to promote myself. A lot of people believe that the key to making others like you is to be cool or mysterious, but I believe that is very detrimental to your ability to make friends. When you are interacting with others you want to make them feel good. They don’t care about you or if you are cool. They care about how you make them feel. When you are positive and happy around people they will like you because they will know you like them. They will feel good about themselves. This was one of the things that puzzled me the most during college because I would avoid smiling to look like a formal person. I would always wonder why people would stop talking to me after maybe two minutes. The conversation ended as soon as it started. When I started smiling, not only was I able to attract more friends, but I was also more engaging. My laughter became contagious and I remained engaged in the conversation. It may seem simple, but smiling will make wonders for you. The biggest mistake I made in college was trying to be friends with every person I met. I didn’t prioritize friendships and if I felt like I could get something out of other people I would try to be their friend instead. What this did to me was that I ended up with no real friends. I was the person everyone said “hi” to, but nobody wanted to talk with. Everyone thought I was so happy and that I had so many friends. the truth is that I was so alone. The other problem was that since I was “friends” with many people, I would have to take someone’s side and ignore my other comrades. I ruined one relationship because I tried to be friends with two different groups whose ideas clashed. I tried to satisfy everyone but in the end, I satisfied no one. It all changed when I started to focus on a select group o 5–6 people with similar values and ideas as mine. A lot of times we think we need to be friends with as many people as possible to be successful in life, but that is not true. Just like one of my best friends said “If you cannot ask for $100 from a person in case you need it, then they are not your friend.” That opened my eyes and I never forget it to this day. Focus on making true friends and you will not regret it. If you try to be friends with everyone, you will not make true friendships. And that’s all. I hope you enjoyed these three tips on how to make true friends☺️. Make sure to check this blog which offers a great explanation of how to make friends: "
https://medium.com/@juanky006/5-tech-jobs-you-should-consider-in-2023-62275442b1cf?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"This blog post is about 5 tech careers you should consider starting right after you graduate from college or if you are planning to change jobs in 2023. Most computer science college students don’t know what to do after graduation. They usually think their only responsibility at the moment is to take classes and if they get good grades, they will get the job they want without any problem. It is not so easy! People wanting to change careers often wonder what they should do. There are so many options nowadays that it seems really hard to decide what you want to do. In this article, I want to help those college students and people who want to change careers make a decision. My goal is to explain what these careers are about so people are able to choose the one they like. A front-end developer is someone who builds user interfaces. He or she spends time developing the components that allow users to interact with applications. For instance, they create buttons, tables, dropdowns, and menus that allow the user to navigate an application, game, or website. It is a fun position to work in as you can see the immediate results of your contribution and you can work on making things look good. The skills you need to be a front-end developer vary depending on the company you want to work in. But a safe bet is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. It is a challenging position (not as easy as people think), but it is definitely easier to grasp than other roles like firmware engineer for example. What I like the most about this career is that you can immediately see the effects of your creations. I love making user interfaces look pretty, and I always judge a product based on its user experience. If you are like me, I would recommend you choose this career for when you graduate or if you want to start in the tech field. Front-end developers build the visual aspect of a website. Back-end developers build the machinery behind a website. They build what users cannot see: databases, security protocols, server-side operations, and API endpoints. College students should consider this position as a lot of the work will do in a computer science degree involves back-end development. In college, you will learn things like Java, C++, SQL, Python, and Linux. You will also learn useful skills from courses such as cyber security, API, and databases, so I would recommend you take advantage of that. As for people trying to change careers, back-end development is harder to grasp than front-end because you have to use harder languages or technologies than JavaScript or HTML. Here, you deal with Java and multiple services to send data to clients. Therefore, I recommend this one mostly to computer science students who will spend 4 years learning these skills. Data analysts are people who use data to help a business in decision-making. They gather data with programming, find patterns, create charts, and present their findings with a presentation. Data analysts are valuable as they allow a business to understand its customers and make more informed decisions. A data analyst will help a business determine what they are doing well, and what they aren’t. For example, data analysts can gather data on the usage of a business’ website and define its shortcomings or features users don’t like. This position is for people who love working with data and finding patterns. To me, this is a fun career. You get data from a website, clean it, and process it. Then you create charts and draw your conclusions so you can present them to your co-workers. Not only that, but it can be an introductory field for more complex areas like machine learning. Information security analysts are people who work to gather information about the security mechanisms that protect a company’s data. For instance, an information security analyst will work on gathering data about firewalls to strengthen them; they will also work on seeing if the software is up to date to prevent a data breach. They look at possible vulnerabilities in their system and try to strengthen them. Cyber security will be one of the most in-demand fields in the next decade as a lot of things will revolve around technologies like artificial intelligence, networks, and databases. You don’t want these machines to be hacked by an evil person or the results could be catastrophic. Imagine someone steals the data at one of Google’s data centers. That would be bad and if you choose this field you can help prevent it. Finally, a database administrator is a person in charge of managing a database’s operation and security. Some of the responsibilities of a database administrator include keeping databases up to date and creating a backup for the data. As a database administrator, you will be able to work in many places from tech companies to banks. Almost every company nowadays gathers tons of data, and they need somewhere to store it. Consequently, they need someone to manage the place where they store that data. This is where database administrators come in. Thank you!

https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/5-skills-to-be-a-top-ux-designer-775eedfa49f6?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"This article will give you 5 skills to be a top designer. Setting the main goals for the application you are designing will allow you to follow one path and have the right direction. When you start a project, you should know why you are doing what you are doing. If you don’t define what you want to achieve with your project you will go nowhere. Define the primary purpose of the application. Think about what you want your users to feel when they are using it. Decide what benefits you want the users to have. These are very important things to define as they will help you to move in one direction. In other words, once you have a main idea, you can design components based on that idea and not try to take multiple paths. Being a top designer also means being a top sketcher. Sketching will allow for brainstorming and turning your ideas into reality. Now, I am not saying your sketches should be very sharp and detailed from the beginning. You can start by drawing some boxes and thinking of the main functionality each section will serve. After you have sketched these basic figures, you can go and create a more detailed sketch with icons, user flows, and components in your user interface. For instance, you can draw a scroll bar and draw the different components that will be shown as you scroll from top to bottom. As you sketch, ideas will naturally come to you. Finally, don’t be afraid to make drawings that suck. Those drawings can be your starting point for a design. Don’t be afraid to be messy. When you communicate with your team, you can discuss ideas with them and they can give you feedback. Many people often think that designing means working in solitude, and you just go to Canva or whatever app you use and start making cute designs. What you should do is define what you want, make simple designs, and share them with others. When you share designs with others, you can find out the shortcomings of your design. Other people will give you their perspective, and that will allow you to enhance your design. Communicating with others will allow you to find solutions to problems you didn’t know how to solve. For example, maybe you want users to have a wish list, but you don’t know how to implement it. A friend or another designer can help you find out how with your current design. Designing is like coding. When you look back on a design you did six months ago, you may not remember why you did it. Make sure to add comments to your design that explains what you are doing. If not, you may be wondering why you did this and that 🥲. Another bad thing that can happen is losing your sketches. To prevent this from happening you can buy a folder where you put all your designs. You could also sketch on an iPad or any computer software and save your scans digitally. Finally, you could print those documents so you can have them physically and double your security. Design is not just about sketching, drawing, and using beautiful colors. Design is also about understanding your users’ perspective. Design is about knowing Marketing, Psychology, and other subjects. When you design you rely on other subjects to determine what the best design is. Make sure to learn from other subjects as it will allow you to give different perspectives to your designs. And that’s it! These are 5 skills to be a top designer 😊. Other resources: “15 Simple Habits That Will Help You Become a Better UX Designer” by Nick Babich "
https://medium.com/@juanky006/what-is-docker-and-why-should-you-use-it-cb4f0c5ee2f6?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"This blog post is a quick high-level overview of what Docker is and why you should is it if you are a Software Developer Being a software developer nowadays is really hard because you have to deal with many dependencies. I bet this scenario has happened to you multiple times: you create an application that runs fine on your computer. Later you ask your friend to try it on his own computer. Minutes later you find out it doesn’t work. But how??? Chances are the development environment your friend is working in is different from yours. A development environment refers to the programming language, framework, and tool versions that are in a workspace within your computer. So now that you know this, how can you fix it? Well, you could install the tools you need on your friend’s computer. That sounds like a nice solution, but imagine doing this every time you want to share an application. That would be really tedious😔. Here comes Docker and containers. Docker is a tool that allows you to create and manage containers. A container, in simple terms, is a folder or package that contains the code, tools, and appropriate libraries to run the application. It has all you need to run an application and you don’t have to install any dependencies for it to work. The application will run smoothly and behave exactly the same as before. Very interesting I know! Containers allow you to ship a package of code and run it without having to download any external software. For instance, I can create a Django app. I can create a Docker image, which refers to a container that is not running. Then, it can share it with a friend and when he runs it, the application will behave as expected. Pretty neat right? There are other uses of Docker containers: During work, I use Docker frequently, and it allows me to have a smoother development time. No more crying atthe console due to incompatible environments. I hope you enjoyed this introductory talk about Docker and let me know if you would like more like this!

https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-flowcharts-improve-your-coding-process-194abdd17ae5?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"This post is all about how flowcharts can help you develop apps more efficiently. You will learn what advantages a flowchart gives you in software development. A flowchart is a diagram that allows developers to see the steps and decisions their program will take. This sample program will get two numbers and ask the user to guess the numbers. If he guesses right the program ends, but if he guesses incorrectly, the program stays stuck in a loop until he guesses the correct numbers. This program may seem dumb, but that is not the point. This example allows for a better understanding. Drawing a flowchart like this provides developers with many benefits. Just look at it. You read it and you know what the application is going to do. See how useful it is? Let me talk about the benefits in detail. Drawing a flowchart allows you to see the individual features your program has. This allows you to work on one feature at a time. In this example, you know the first step is getting the two numbers. You are just focused on that feature and don’t need to worry about others yet. This allows you to focus on the correct steps for that feature. Not only that but it allows you to decide how you will build that feature. You can decide to write your own logic. You can ask for people’s opinions and even look at other open-source projects that have implemented similar functionality. That way you don’t reinvent the wheel. Imagine you didn’t do this and try to code everything at the same time. You wouldn’t think clearly and miss things. By working on a single feature at a time, you are more focused. You can test one feature individually before you move to the next. If that feature works, you can move to the next and make updates to the previous one if needed. Flowcharts allow us to understand the individual components of an application and code them. However, that is not the only benefit you can get from them. Flowcharts allow you to determine the functionality of your application and other things: Not only have you understood the individual components of your application by drawing the flowchart. You have also understood its whole purpose. A flowchart can be an awesome communication tool. A flowchart allows you to show your idea to others before you design your application. Many teams in software engineering use flowcharts to show others how their applications will work. Countless times I have relied on flowcharts to design my applications. Will your application make an API request? You can write that on a flowchart. Then, you can draw what happens next. Finally, since you communicate with tech geniuses. They will be able to tell you the problems the application has and inconsistencies in logic. Pretty neat, huh? That was it! An article about how flowcharts can improve your coding process😉.

Here I provide you with my list of the best programming languages to learn in 2023 so you can have more job options. Photo by Mr. Bochelly on Unsplash JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to build websites and server logic. It was originally developed by Netscape to make static websites more interactive. Today, it is one of the core technologies that power the internet, along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is primarily used to build user interfaces, although it can also be used to write server logic and mobile applications. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is well-suited for web development and is widely used by developers all over the world. Regardless of your major in college, you should learn JavaScript as it will provide you with many job opportunities. It could be in the medical field, financial field, or anywhere interactive applications are needed. What is for sure is that you will be equipped with a tool you can use anywhere in today’s digital world. Python is a language that is used for virtually anything you can think of. Data Science and Machine Learning? Python got you. Web Development? Python got you. User interfaces? Python got you. The reason why Python is so popular is that it has so many libraries available for developers to use. In case you don’t have a Computer Science background, a library is a functionality someone has worked on to make development quicker and easier for you. For instance, you can add numbers in an array with a single line of code thanks to NumPy, a library for manipulating numbers. I would recommend you to learn Python not only because it is widely used in the development industry but also because it’s easy and fun to learn. It will introduce you to the world of programming without the struggles of other languages like C++. Java is one of the most popular languages nowadays for sure. It has a syntax similar to C++. However, it is purely based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a way to organize pieces of code in a container and to represent real-life objects like accounts in programming. OOP is used everywhere in the development industry, and I think Java is the best language to learn OOP concepts. I have used Java in all my development jobs, so it is definitely an important tool in your arsenal. I would recommend you learn this language after Python or JavaScript as it is more complex, and I think you should focus on understanding programming logic without having to think about syntax. Go is an awesome language. It was developed by Google to handle requests and has features like concurrent operations, better performance, and simple syntax. Go has been in the industry for a long time and it is not going anywhere any time soon. I think the reasons why you should learn Go are very similar to the ones already mentioned in previous languages like having a nice introduction to programming through a somewhat easy language, learning an in-demand skill, and being part of a community of active developers who contribute to this open-source language. The final language in this list is a special one as it is designed to query (get) data from databases. If you want to handle a moderate amount of data you should use spreadsheets. However, if you want to handle a massive amount of data, you should use SQL. You probably have heard that we are in the era of big data. Each day, data grows exponentially larger as we collect more information from users and devices. SQL is one of the few tools capable of handling those amounts of data. And that’s it.

https://medium.com/@juanky006/3-reasons-why-you-should-learn-system-design-fcf4efb312a7?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"A lot of people think that learning System Design when you are a beginner or junior developer is useless. In my opinion, learning System Design is one of the best things you can do for your early career. Let me explain why I think you should learn System Design in college. Most people think that when it comes to Software Development, it’s just about deciding you want to build an application and just start coding. That’s not how it works. Before starting you have to ask a lot of questions. For instance: Now, these questions are not necessarily part of System Design, but the point is that when it comes to developing an application, the most important part is gathering requirements. Learning about System Design and practicing interviews will teach you that you need to gather requirements before building an application. When I had my first Software Development internship, I remember my mentor giving me a huge project to work on: he wanted me to build a back-end system for a front-end app. He asked me to build an API, a database, and a server. I knew what a database and server are, but had no clue about the API. Furthermore, I didn’t know how each of the components worked. I knew JavaScript, React, Python, and other technologies, but I didn’t know how a computer sent a request to a server and how the server sends a response. The result was that I couldn’t complete my project. I barely finished a small library that would arrange the data together. As a result, I didn’t get a return offer and my dreams of working at that company were over. This could have been avoided if I had learned System Design concepts in college since it would have allowed me to work on my project and give a better impression. A lot of people think that only coding matters, but what matters is understanding the things you build with coding. Coding is a tool just like a hammer is a tool. You cannot build a house if you only understand the hammer and not the components of a house. When I got my first Software Development full-time job, I was very happy. I couldn’t believe what I had achieved; I spent three years learning Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, SQL, data structures, and algorithms in order to get the job. However, the biggest contributing factor to my success was learning System Design. My technical interview consisted solely of designing a system for a gym website. It was surprising to me as I didn’t expect to get a System Design question as an entry-level developer, but I did it thanks to putting effort into learning Design concepts. So, if you think you don’t need System Design because you are a beginner you are wrong. Understanding how to build systems can be the difference between getting a job or missing the opportunity. That’s it! Hope you enjoyed this post. These are my three reasons why you should learn System Design as a college student. Please make sure to share if you found it useful and think someone might benefit from this☺️. "
https://medium.com/@juanky006/asynchronous-javascript-made-simple-4feb1c701092?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"Understand what asynchronous code means. Photo by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash While on your JavaScript journey, you might have heard multiple terms. I can guarantee you that one of those you heard the most was asynchronous JavaScript, but what it is and how does it help in web development? Asynchronous JavaScript is a technique in which code is designed to execute in a non-blocking manner, meaning when a specific type of code runs other code is allowed to run. Asynchronous code operates in the background and communicates with other parts of the program using callback functions or Promises. There are several ways to write asynchronous JavaScript code, including using the async and await keywords, as well as using Promises. For example, you can use the setTimeout function to execute a callback function after a specified amount of time has passed: In this example, the console.log will be executed after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) have passed. This allows other code to continue running in the meantime, rather than being blocked by the setTimeout function. If you run it you will see the add gets printed first, which means it executed while the other function was running. Asynchronous JavaScript is often used in situations where data needs to be loaded or fetched from an external source, such as a server or database. By using asynchronous techniques, the program can continue to run while the data is being fetched, rather than being blocked until the data is available. This can help to improve the performance and responsiveness of the program. This is especially important in JavaScript where the web experience has to be smooth. If the code was blocked while making a call to an API, then the website might get stuck and the user would be waiting for the call to finish to do a certain action. One way to execute asynchronous code in JavaScript is with promises, which is an object that allows you to write asynchronous code while looking synchronous. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. As you can imagine if I make a request to an API, I will get fulfilled state if the request was successful, rejected if it was not, and pending while it is being processed. You can use the then method of a Promise to specify what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled or rejected. The then method takes two arguments: a callback function for the fulfilled case and a callback function for the rejected case. Here, the Promise succeeds after the add function finishes executing and the value it accepts is the result of the add function. In this case, 3 shows in the console. Promises are very useful because they are very readable thanks to the then and catch methods. The then method allows you to chain promises together, and whatever happens in one Promise will be used for the subsequent Promise. Finally, the catch method allows you to handle any errors that may occur during the asynchronous operation. This happens when a promise is rejected. The true power of a promise can be seen when you fetch an API: In this code, the function formatUrlwill make the url match the format required by my example API. After that, it will fetch the data, parse it into JSON, and finally print it to the console. All while not blocking the other code, being readable, and having a segment that catches errors, the catch statement. See how readable and smooth it looks. And with this, we conclude this introduction to asynchronous JavaScript. Hope you liked it, and subscribe for more quality content.

https://medium.com/@juanky006/3-strategies-to-become-a-better-software-developer-b0a8066a64bf?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"College students don’t have much coding experience in general. Because of that, they fall into many traps. In this post, I will talk about how college students can learn faster and become amazing engineers. If you are new to the world of software development, you probably are excited to learn multiple languages at once because you have heard multiple people talking about how awesome they are since they can code in 15 different programming languages. However, when starting out you should only focus on learning one language be it Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, or whichever you want. When I started out, I remember I tried to learn Python and C++ at the same time. I wasted so much time because by doing so I focused more on quantity than quality. I was desperate to learn as fast as possible so I could get a job. Therefore, I went through the tutorials more quickly than I should have and in the end, I didn’t master any of the two. It all changed when I decided to focus on C++ and then learn Python. It took me like 3 months to learn C++ but it was worth it since I mastered the basics that allowed me to learn other programming languages fast. When starting out, master one programming language. Understand basic concepts like variables, strings, functions, classes, etc… Once you learn that you can easily learn a new language since the concepts are basically the same. The only difference between them is the syntax and how the concepts are applied in them. When people apply for software development jobs nowadays, they think that the key to getting the job is having the best projects in the world. These projects take longer. Therefore, people who are looking for jobs will try to finish as quickly as possible and in doing so they won’t fully understand the application. Once they get to the interview they will realize they don’t understand what they did and that they haven’t learned to code. Instead of doing this build small projects and master the concepts in them. Take it slowly and digest the material. For example, build a single-page application with React if you want to be a front-end developer or build a database system if you want to be a database developer. You don’t need to build a full-stack application when starting out. That will make you burn out. Instead, understand one area first by building a simple application. How many times has this happened to you? A professor gives you an assignment, and you immediately start writing code. A few hours have passed, and you are stuck. You don’t know what you did and your code is full of bugs. I bet it has happened many times since it happened to me too! Programming is not just typing on the keyboard. 80% of programming is gathering requirements and planning out how you are going to build an application. You have to know what you are going to build, to code it. If you don’t, how can you do it? You should think about what your application will look like, what components it will have, and how it will work. You have to think about what’s the best language to write it on, what design patterns to use, and what components it will have. When I was a beginner I believed the key to being a successful software engineer involves learning as many technologies as you can. I thought I should learn Python, React, MongoDB, JavaScript, COBOL, and C++, and I would be invincible. I learned the hard way after many failures that what matter is understanding how your application will work. I learned to ask questions like: A programming language is just a tool. You cannot build a house if you only know how the tool works (a hammer). You have to understand how a house works. The same goes for software: even if you are a master of Python and SQL, you cannot build the program if you don’t understand how it works. If you don’t know what you are building, it doesn’t matter if you know what classes and queries are. When you are in college you will seldom work in teams. However, that experience will be very different compared to working at a tech company. There you have to communicate with other teams not only with yours. It is the equivalent of doing a group project in your class, but you also have to communicate with other teams from your class and even with teams from other classes. You need to constantly check what others are doing as it will affect your work. Believe me. It is not nice when you learn - at the last minute - that the API you need is not working 🥲. That’s it. This post was all about 5 strategies I think every college student should practice to become the best software developer they can be. "

I can feel my pain getting Healed in this rain. The rain always reminds me of the purity it holds. The power to silence the fire. Standing here and watching it is like seeing all my randomness dissolve. The uneasiness of my brain, which keeps on running even in night, stops running and starts living. The purity it holds is awesome. There is a fire in all of us. It can never dissipate. We’ll have to live with it, but it can reduce its impact on me for. Days passed, weeks passed, years passed, but this rain always stayed. Can you feel the voice of rain, the purified air, and the small drops penetrating from my window? I don’t want to share this moment with anyone. Only I deserve this moment. I just want to store it and share it with everyone. We sometimes don’t imagine what we are missing in this world. Being materialistic is good, but leaving this sense of satisfaction behind is awesome. You know what? I am with you till the rain doesn’t stop. You know me till you are reading this article; you will disappear, I will disappear. What will be left is this article? You can come a little closer to me by commenting on this post or clapping for it. Then I can remember your name for a few more days, and you can remember me for even more days. but the end will come. The feeling of this combination of the sweetest air, a small drop of rain, and the thunder is not letting me think of anything. I tried, but I failed. I can just talk; I can just express; I can just store. I will not bore you by lecturing you on the importance of being in the present moment. But find a time when you can free yourself for some time. Store it here and serve it to other people so that they can also live what you lived. The 4 years I was nearly home, spent a lot of time with me. And the best part is I created Me. Me is a person who will always stand against my mind, which works on senses. But Me know what is good and what is not. Me is interesting , a completely changed person who loves his passion. But don't be Me. Me is struggling and is depressed. Me is not happy. CONCLUSION Maybe Me will find its place, but you have chance live to the fullest. I will not make it difficult for you. Live to the fullest is actually just live. Do whatever you want to do. By that, I mean do whatever you want to do, but don’t get stuck in a vicious cycle of emotions. The most beautiful “live” is love. unconscionable, uncommon, unimaginable, and unlimited. "
https://medium.com/be-open/what-i-miss-from-my-first-unconditional-love-days-7c37fc622bca?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Days back in school when I was just a common boy, I wanted to be uncommon and different. Having a girlfriend was like a trend at that time, so I followed it. I found someone to love, just from nowhere don’t know why I choose her. I don’t have aims in life. I was just enjoying my life with girls. I was trying to be a stud because I was so much fascinated by them. trying to be a stud is difficult when you are not meant to be. It’s something like you are trying to be someone you are not. What this does is you lose what you are. Now, this is something new i am about to tell. people will tell you don’t try to be others but you will become someone else. now what? now you need to be back yourself again and in doing it you have found yourself again. You need to find the aim of your life. Your unique behaviour, your unique talent everything. This will be your way back home. back to the story. so I started loving her. I even don’t know today that I really loved her or not. I started thinking of her as my life. she was everything for me. I invested everything I have at that time for her, my time, my heart, and my patience. So I proposed to her. but she rejected me. I proposed her again . she rejected me again. the cycle goes on. things were really bad with me. I made it an aim to make her my girlfriend. This is a lesson. Don’t take everything on ego, at least not a girl’s rejection. never take it on ego. she is a human you cannot control her. she has a right to be with someone she loves. I become a rejected depressed guy. I kept trying. I was stubborn. Then I finally convinced her. she got convinced. but I thought that was my success but that’s not. that was a turning point in my life. I was about to break down into pieces. so situations turn around. I expected a lot from her, but I didn’t get it back. So i broke up with her. I did it myself.it was awful.it broke me down into pieces. I suddenly came out of a hole I was stuck in. The hole was filled with her. when I came out I saw the real world. the world is ready to hit me. I realized that she was not important to me. I have to work to survive for a living. So this is another life lesson. don’t love something that much that you forgot the world you live in. maybe many of you don’t do it often. but you do it rarely. so trust me you cannot afford it to do rarely. back to the story, I was broke down. I saw the world that is way ahead of me. I made a bad mistake in my early years. now I will not make it the whole of my life. you love someone. you do it. how can you not control it? you cannot? ask yourself. if not then there are a lot of things you cannot control about yourself. if that is the case, you will suffer from everything you cannot control, including love itself. think about it. What I miss about those days Finally, it’s here. What I miss is everything. my unconditional love for her. I don’t think I will do that much love to someone in my whole life. unconditional love is actually foolish. I miss the days I feel depressed when she doesn’t come to school. I miss the times I got jealous when she enjoys with someone else. I miss the days when I reminisce about her while listening to songs. I miss the days when I frequently visit her house for no reason. her house was the only picnic spot for me. I miss those days. I don’t miss her now. i don’t love her now. but I do miss those unconditional love days "

But this mistake I am about to tell you often goes unnoticed. We always want someone with us. They can be friends, family, girlfriends or boyfriends. This is no sin to be with someone always. If you see around yourself most people are always surrounded by some or many people. But they all miss seeing the beautiful world around them. They don’t listen to the chirping of birds. They don’t see the beauty of nature. They don’t feel the air flowing. Many of you may have missed it. But since I am an introvert with a very handful of friends, most times I stay alone while going to college. So I will make you feel the beauty of the world through my eyes. Through the eyes of an introvert. I started my journey for college through a metro station. When I entered the metro all are busy with something. Most people were busy with mobile phones. some were busy with friends, family and lovers. The moment the metro started I start watching out through the big metro window. Firstly I saw big buildings, under construction buildings, grounds, beautiful trees, small colonies etc. They all are not that beautiful but give you a feeling of the present moment. To get immersed at the moment to observe the flying birds. Buildings are beautiful and they are engineering marvels. Our ancestors worked hard to bring this world to us. The metro fast-moving vehicles with 200 km/h speed. It took a series of inventions to bring this to birth. Then come the trees and valleys. Small trees, big trees all look so lovely. The small mountains add an extra charm to the elegance of mother earth. Feel the liveliness of the scene. The time is passing. It will never come back. The enjoyment at this moment is even more than your most favourite thing. Feel the beautiful grasslands. how can someone miss this beautiful world? I wrote in the title that “see your life through the lens of an introvert. So by roaming alone for some time every day you can feel the world around you. The beauty of the world. This is a form of meditation and a method to be happy. Leaving our problems and just enjoying the world around us will tell us how much materialistic we are. We don't need anything to be happy. Maybe everything written in the above paragraph may sound a lot spiritual. But this practice will benefit you in your life. Nowadays we have circumvented ourselves with so much stress. Reducing stress will improve productivity and work efficiency. "
https://medium.com/be-open/is-having-a-girlfriend-a-need-of-modern-world-f97452de9ef3?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Maybe yes because this is the modern world and everyone has one, maybe no because many relationships are not growth-oriented and they end up messing everything emotionally or physically, maybe yes because some girls are great and can skyrocket your personal growth and career as well. The answer is really tough. But since I live in India some guys may encounter this issue but many don’t. Most of them are so eagerly searching for girls on tinder, Facebook that it doesn’t matter whether it will result in a good relationship or bad they just need a girlfriend that it may be because of the thing I conveyed in tittle. When we talk about countries where it’s common to have relationships, people should start thinking about why are they doing it. Is it just for enjoyment, if that is the case then you are in a right direction? But if it is not the case then you should start thinking deeply about it. Why I am saying it because many a time things become complex to resolve which end up hurting us emotionally. Maybe physically when some are angry but that physical injury can be healed. When I was in my 9th and 10th, I was a kind of crazy stud guy. I was always with girls. I was in a relationship with 2 at a time. Okay don’t get angry or judge me, girls who are reading this, I know that was wrong and that’s why I wrote myself stupid. Now when I see myself and my life at that time there are a lot of conclusions I can make and compare myself with a negligible productive guy with a highly productive guy. The girls I dumbed could have done wonders for me. Maybe they could have changed me and made me a good guy. If I was serious in that relationship and I was not just enjoying in the name of girlfriend-boyfriend relationships. until things are fun they don’t hurt but when become serious they hurt. I had some very serious breakups that hurt me a lot. It took time for me to be comfortable with the situation. I have known some of the guys who tell me that they are in a growth-oriented relationship. But many of the intelligent guys I know are all either single or does not want to come into relationships. Maybe because they know the reality that I know. Time should be of paramount importance to every young guy out there. If things are not at all productive and it just wasting your time then you should immediately remove your ass off from relationships. Rich guys knows this and they just value the treasure we have that is time. I was studying entropy and available energy nowadays in thermodynamics. conclusion to the topic of entropy and available energy was some energy will always be destroyed and will not be converted to work. So eventually you will always need some time that will be kept for work but not used for it since no one is 100 per cent productive. Being in a relationship is not a sin but not being optimistic about your life is. If you are in your 20s then you are already in a big competitive world where there are either losers or winners. Start watching things as a whole. Because they either know how to manage their time or they just do things in a very limited time so things don’t hurt back. Next time before getting in a relationship think of how you are going to manage your time. "

The reason is in the tittle. I was trying to clear mess of my life. I now got to know that life will always remains a mess. It has been quite a long time i am behaving like an introvert. I was an absurd extrovert till my 10th grade. 4 years in extreme extrovert then 6 years in extreme introvert. Welcome to my life. I now realized how can someone live on so extremes. I don't know. The definition of extrovert and introvert is flawed for me. A big A** introvert , away from social media for years, when i say away from social it means having insta and WhatsApp with no girl in contact , this condition is for a boy who masturbated very badly for years. The second condition which is also a big challenge is staying celibate for years, away from any stimulus. Can you imaging my life? yeah great if you can because this is just the tip of the iceberg. My obsession with me , with my work , with my life forced me to stay in a room for years . Missing family functions, missing parties , staying away from college clubs. imaging it ? can you see me. nobody can see me. Changing yourself is difficult ? it is the most easy task of the world . The biggest task is to face the repercussions. Don't feel sad for me. I will come out of it. You know what , nobody will never get to know about me and about you either. its you and me who understands you and me. Don't live in extremes . Not everyone is RJ (short form of my name). you cannot live like that . its just for me. honestly not very great also. Conclusion No conclusion. Drink , have s**, Work hard , very hard and enjoy life. I know enjoying life is nonsense. okay just act like enjoying. "
https://medium.com/be-open/my-love-for-girls-a7620083daa2?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"The beauty of girls always fascinated me. I have some of my best friends which are girls and they are not so-called “girlfriends”. They were just friends. Girls can be anything for the world but for me, they are cute and emotional. There is a sense of emotions that I have felt only with girls. girls are emotional and they understand emotions. I was always emotionally weaker. Which means I was not great at hiding emotions. These friends were always my support system. I was bad at making decisions and girls are great at listening. I have made so many great friends in school. They were my best buddies. But among them, my friends who are girls are the ones who are there even after 5 years of passing out. My relationship with girls has been like a sin curve. In my school days, I was a guy who always remains with girls. I have had many relationships. Many were fake. One was deeply real. Other than these girls my best friends who used to stay with me the whole day. We use to talk the whole day. We help each other in almost all situations, especially in making girlfriend and boyfriend. Then in high school, I stopped talking to girls much. I changed school. I was in mess with almost all the teachers. People use to enjoy college. But my case was different. I was a bit bored with girls and know reality. I am one of the luckiest people who have got some of my best friends as girls. I know many would say like boys are the best buddies and no one can be better friends as boys do. That’s actually correct but that depends on what kind of friends you want. For the people like me who are always weak in taking relationships and life decisions, girls were the best help for me. Being with girls was just fun for me at that time. but eventually, some become my best buddies. The love deepens when I saw them helping me get out of situations. I saw them standing for me caring for me which is not given by dozens of best buddies who are boys. This eventually attracted me toward the female gender and the beauty they possess. they are caring and understanding me and everyone else. I would like to add that maybe you cannot get friends as I got. maybe you’ll get to meet nerds. but don’t lose hope. one thing that I can assure you is that you will get one. when you get one respect her as a friend as a woman. as I told girls are emotional they got hurt easily. I was fortunate enough to have got some very beautiful souls as my girlfriend in school days. but I didn’t know the value of them. eventually, I end up losing them. I regret losing them not because I wanted a girlfriend now but because I know there are not many girls out there who can actually understand me better as they understood. The love they gave me in those months will never be given by anyone else. The reality is I was not an achiever kind of guy. I was not someone who was so smart and all. yeah, I was famous in school at that time, maybe that is the reason I was able to make a lot of good friends. but after my passing out they showered me with the same love as they did in school. many do it till now. honestly, none of my best buddies does it now. I was expecting some kind of emotional support from my friends. but there is a difference that exists between the nature of girls and boys. I can assure you as long as you are not betraying a girl she will never backstab you. I feel great when I think about the investments that I made in relationships in school days which is paying me to date. Their love and the feeling that they are there for me make me feel great and a sense of relief that if things go wrong they will help me. The guy I was in school was someone who just don’t care about anyone’s feelings. There was a sense of innocence which I can reminisce about now in almost all of them. boys were the people who are playing dam games and they were the bearers. well to be very honest things are upside down in college. my readers are intelligent and know the rest. Today I met a girl who very innocently came to me and asked me about my college. she smiled and went away. so if I was the guy from school I would feel it as an indication of the interest she showed in me. but that’s not the case. I need to accept the fact that the world is not just about boyfriend and girlfriend. I would like to admire the innocence some girls hold which makes them love instantly. the smile, the nature makes the world a better place to live in. Travelling in the metro so much made me realize the beauty girls possess in the world. many times I feel to comment on someone about how cute and beautiful they look but the next moment I realize that I live in India. Things could go a lot wrong if I mess with the wrong girl. now many will think of me as a coward, so no problem because you can fight with a girl but not with the mentality of society. I don’t know how can some men do these pieces of shit with their wives and all. I live in India and many times I feel disgusted about the men who treat their wives badly. The number of restrictions girls have to face made me realize how much the gender female is suffering. in a society where we pray goddess Saraswati and Parvati, we don’t give respect to women they deserve. Girls in India are facing many differences which they shouldn’t be facing at all. maybe that is not a common thought for many. but since I told you about how I feel about girls I feel bad to see them suffering. The purpose of this article is not just to make girls realize their value but also to give a glimpse of how girls helped me reach what I am today as a person. many people would have their stories so remind them and I would love to know them in the comment section. A single takeaway for girls is just a message “go and see yourself in the mirror so that you can understand how beautiful you are. the people will compare you but the reality is every one of us especially girls is beautiful, not just from face but from souls as well.” Finally, don’t judge me after reading this article as these are my true feelings and I don’t regret a small section of it.

There can be a number of comfort zones with yourself. Some can be like staying with someone always, not choosing wise friends, indulging in all conversations. Some readers will call them bad habits.

The hard choices are necessary to take if you want to grow. One hundred thoughts will pop up in your mind. But you have to stay on the choices. Decision-making plays a great role in one’s life to remain progressive. My journey of hard choices It took time to understand the importance of making hard choices. Things stay the same if you don’t care to change them. Maybe they are hurting you, but you could have been in a habit. But when the time of making hard choices came. I took it. I left my toxic friends, painful and different. I was still trying to adjust to the changes. The change acceptance time depends solely on the step you have taken. My step left me alone with no friend left to enjoy with. I always have a habit of validating my decisions. But the more I talk to people the more I got confused. This step should make things worse for you. The need for the step for your personal life, specifically dealing with habits and behaviour, should not be there. Don’t judge yourself. I know this is not easy, but with time you will also heal. Things will change. Situations will get better if you don’t lose hope. Trust me, if you know the decision is right, go for it.

I reminisce about the time when you helped me convince my first crush to come into a relationship with me. This is the advantage of having a girl as your best friend. I always helped you in your relationship and you helped me in my relationships. I remember how you get into casual relationships and then come to me so that I can help you clear all the mess. We both were made for each other friends. Both are assholes. There is so much I remember about you. It has been more than a year since you had gone to almighty. It has been more than 6 years since we left school days. But everything is there, as fresh as it has happened yesterday. I know you share a special bond with everyone but our bond was unique. I feel shallow. I miss you. We were just friends. But you have been always my support system. You were always there when I fall into relationships. You were there when I ditch girls in relationships. You were always there. I know I learned to move alone but that was because it is the demand of the world. I never stopped loving you, my friend. Now I realised that I was the happiest guy when I was with you. We were 4 friends. I have 2 of them now also. But still, I wanted all of you. How can you go at such an early age? Don’t you miss my company in heaven? Because I miss your company. There is an emptiness that can never be filled. You are the first to go from my life and the closest one. I have my family and some friends also who are not at all considered friends. You were someone who always understand me. Some naughty memories I remind the time when we both use to sit together and talk the whole day about wide-ranging topics about relationships. I use to tell you about all the relationships that are ongoing in our school. We use to laugh and talk. Ignoring all the teachers that are coming to our class. Just enjoying. Those days when you caught my love letter which is to be given to my crush. We use to tease our principal by talking at a particular place and time. I use to fight with my friends for not judging you when you change your boyfriend drastically. You are just so cute. You use to get taunted by teachers when they say that all girls support boys. You know maybe I was popular in school, but still, I needed you in my journey of success. I can never make friend like you. You were just three in my life who use to understand me. you went away, the other one also went away. One went to study abroad. Everyone needs friends I know now I don’t need anyone in life. I am now socially independent. But still, you use to talk to me. It makes me happy when you talk to me. Because you were so fun-loving. You know maybe you were just the one left whom I can call anytime and can talk to you. Please come back. I am waiting for you. I know you are in heaven. Just be happy there. I will always be with you. "

We keep moving forward and don’t realize where we are going. Some days before I realized that I control my life, then I today realized that it may not be true. I am going somewhere in life where I meant to go and I cannot control it. Sometimes my brain may stop me from doing something the other time my family can stop me and finally the world can stop me. This looks so wired especially in this world where I and I dominate. I always used to think that I am the one who drives my life but when I see my past, I understand that it’s not true at all. I am not happy with my past. But how it all happened made me better today. It’s all destiny that wants things to be unfolded like that. When I was in my first year of college I was passionate about entrepreneurship. So I decided to work on a project. I made a team, I arranged a place for them to work. But the project somehow never finished and then covid came and rest you know. Now, I have experience with a failed project. I am in my third year. And suddenly without my interest, a guy approaches me to work on a project about something that I am passionate about. I got people to work on the project without any hard work. I am somehow approached towards heading a college society. And it all just happened. The situation which took me a semester of 6 months to make just got within 1 month. Now that is destiny. The intuition There is something that is inside which always take you on a good path. But sometimes we don’t listen to it and end up doing a mistake. I am not happy with my past because I don’t use to listen to my intuition before. It’s not my fault not yours too because there is a wall between you and that intuition. The wall name is the world. And let me clarify that intuition still shows you the correct path, not the easiest path. This wall is the biggest enemy of my life and maybe your life also. This wall is the cause of all my mistakes. India's great saints have always emphasized the importance of knowing self. They always convey to the world that all answers lie within us. This wall is what does not let us connect with ourselves. Okay, that’s too much of physiology and spiritualism. You need to find some way to cross the wall. Some of the tried and tested methods include meditation and spending time with yourself. Books are a great way. Don’t judge life. I am judging it for the past 1 month and I realized that maybe that all happened for a reason. We are not gods. We don’t know what would have happened if we have not done that mistake.

How do people change so drastically? How I changed so drastically. I started my journey in school. Unaware of what I was doing. Just going with the flow. Making my senses happy. I did everything so that made my senses happy. This is what we do our whole life. Scrolling Instagram, YouTube is all part of the big trick that our brain plays with us. The game title is dopamine. Don’t know about it. Wait I’ll give you an example. Sex is more enjoyable than eating food because of the difference in dopamine we get from them. In school, I don’t know about paths and destiny just enjoying. So much tension-free. So much happy. The opposite is the case with me now. I had grown up. So tension, career, life everything starts to get meaning. I need to think about the future. Now I am no more tension-free. How everything changed so drastically. Unaware of my paths in school days. When I woke up and saw life after leaving school. I saw the real world which is way ahead of me. People are working on goals, going to good universities, doing something worth remembering. But I didn’t do anything worth remembering. Now I know I had to start but how? Then life came in, it made me realize my passion for engineering. It showed me the way. I started walking on my path. still walking away from my destiny. But after walking for years now it looks like I can see my goal. I can see my destiny. I know my path. How do I get to know it? Why this path? For the people who don’t believe in destiny. I was one of you before. But now things changed. Think about how you got here. Why only here? Why not somewhere else. We use to choose our carer path in high school. Were we ready to choose at that time? We were just 15–16. Okay, we are somewhat ready. But what if we made mistake. we choose the wrong career. The whole point is things always go best with us. Destiny fixes everything. It takes us where we are now. Destiny changed me. Life changed me. I can guarantee that it can change you as well into a more lovable you. Just believe in Destiny. if not destiny believes in yourself. if not that also believe in God. "

I got to experience what it was like to travel before smartphones somehow made us all that little bit dumber. This was back at a time when if you wanted to take a photo, you had to do so with a physical camera, and the internet was something you could only access by paying for it at an internet cafe or using one of the dodgy computers at your hostel. That’s not to say travelling with a smartphone isn’t convenient. I couldn’t imagine travelling without one now, not with my terrible sense of direction and Google lens translating the Japanese menus that I’m surrounded by here in Okinawa. And yet for everything that the smartphone has given to us in this age of budget airlines and Airbnb, it has also stolen so much of what made travel such a magical experience in the first place. Going to another country was like unraveling a mystery. You had to peel away the layers as you searched for the nebulous truth that was lurking beneath, completely unaware that the more you saw, the more you were seeing reflected in yourself. These days, the mystery is gone. Anything that can be done has been done. Not just done, but recorded, edited, filtered, and served up to us by algorithms that are specifically designed to keep our heads buried in our phones while the world blurs around us. There was a time when going out with a camera was a conscious choice. You had to be strategic about it, you see. You couldn’t just take your camera out every night, there were too many dangers with that. Maybe you were going to a sketchier neighbourhood in Bogota or you planned to get incredibly drunk at a beach bar in Railay, meaning that your camera would stay locked in your backpack. Some nights, you’d just have to remember [if you could], and were free to experience them without the window of a lens. And it was fantastic! I was in Koh Tao recently with a buddy of mine. We were enjoying a beer on the beach at sunset when a group of girls came and sat next to us. They proceeded to take about seven hundred photos of themselves, all the while one of nature’s most spectacular displays set the horizon on fire in front of them. I took one photo and this was it. "

People I had never met. We had no connection, no shared friends, no crossed paths. Only they read a story about me moving out of the United States, and they hated me for it. Because I wanted to better myself, and could not find a path to it in the U.S. A path with affordable healthcare services or where I didn’t need to know the location of the emergency exit, just in case someone inside with a gun wanted headlines for a day. So many paths led me to moving away, to a better life. Perhaps your path also leads away, you’re just at the beginning of it. And I’m sure you know as much as I do, there will always be those who are upset with your happiness. It is a fleeting thing. It comes, it goes. But that’s okay. A steady, continuous high is boring. It also takes away from the experience. It is the low points that make the high points so amazing. And yet there are those negatives that don’t go away. Those thoughts, nibbling at the back of your head like puppies attacking walking shoes. Money is, for many, one of those thoughts. It doesn’t just go away. Bills don’t just go away. Trying to afford life doesn’t just go away. Money, or should I say money problems, is what leads to so many failed relationships, so many suicides, so many abandoned dreams. I knew, with my $800 a month student loan payments and rent quickly surging to $2,000 (and beyond), those money problems wouldn’t go away. I often lied to myself. To make it sound like a better reality was just around the corner. I just needed to sell a book. For a movie producer to option a screenplay. For a billion blog reads. Maybe it wasn’t a lie as much as it was wishful thinking. Could all, or one, of those things happen? Sure. Could all, or none of those things… "

I’d heard so much about it and was fascinated to see it. Andy, as a lapsed but nonetheless steadfastly declared Catholic, was well interested to explore this location as well. St. Benedict Abby is nestled between El Cerro del Aripo on one side, towering in its esteem as the highest most point on the island at 3,084 feet above sea level, and closer by on the other side, El Tucuche, the second highest mountain and point on the island at 3,071 feet. A cool bit of trivia is that the monastery is located almost exactly halfway between Port of Spain and Arima, the two major cities in the northern part of the island, at a distance of twelve miles each way. Not sure if this was done on purpose, but it is a rather sublime fact, and means that a majority of people within the major metropolitan area of the north will have equal access to the monastery. In addition, Piarco International Airport is roughly eight miles to the southeast. These mountains house a heavily forested and biodiverse neotropical rainforest — home to waterfalls, caves, petroglyphs, old abandoned cocoa estates and such wildlife as the golden tree frog, red howler monkeys, river otters, collared peccary, ocelots, bearded bellbirds, orange-winged Amazon parrots, morpho butterflies and red brocket deer. Would love to catch a glimpse of all of these fascinating creatures one of these days. Living in the valley of the Northern Range, these mountains loom large and can be seen peeking out and around from houses and buildings and the tallest of palm, mango and kapok trees. We see them when heading back and forth to the market… "

She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

As my Silent Generation (the generation older than the Baby Boomers; there are about 20 million of them in America) mother is still alive, I used to get a good chuckle at those stories as I thought, “Pretty wishful thinking, there, everyone, I’m pretty sure most of the Baby Boomers are still going to be alive twenty (if not thirty) years from now.” And the retirement and long-term care years of the Baby Boomers? Those are going to be long and expensive years. This subject has slipped my mind of late, but recently I heard a story on the radio program Marketplace that covered this very truth. In the story, the reporter talked about her spouse’s grandmother Sue, whose spouse died when she was in her late 80s. As a consequence, her grandson (the reporter’s spouse) had to take over doing her finances and helping her. In return, the grandmother pledged that he would inherit everything when she died. When the grandmother did die, more than a decade later, she only had two thousand dollars left to leave to the grandson. Not many people would do a job (and often a worrying and stressful job like helping an older person figure out finances and costs and long-term care) for a solid decade if they thought they would net two thousand dollars. The hourly pay rate would be measured in pennies. The journalist further pointed that their family was lucky — the grandmother was a fiscally responsible person who had saved a lot of money for her retirement and nursing needs, so the grandson and his family were not responsible for paying for her care out of pocket. (Which is a very real possibility for some families.) All of this is not to say that the only reason we ever take care of people is because we are paid to do so.

It’s endless follow-ups. It’s 40 trips to the gynecologist in three years to find out it’s “just menopause.” It’s getting your period after a year and a half the morning you put on white leggings to go on a 5-hour group hike. It’s well since you got your period you need another sonogram/biopsy, and follow-up. Also, your cholesterol is high, your sugar is high, and your blood pressure is very low — are you even alive? It’s you better change your diet or you’ll have a heart attack/become diabetic/croak. Don’t eat rice, cheese, meat, or bread, but don’t lose weight because you’re already too thin with no blood pressure and seem somewhat dead. It’s “You’re 53?!

What is not to love? I believe this is the way humans are supposed to live and enjoy life every single day. But this kind of social culture and laid-back mentality can be found mostly in Southern Europe, not as much in the North. Yesterday, I talked with my friend who moved a few years ago from Granada to Amsterdam for a job and her ex. Although she described Amsterdam as incredibly picturesque and resembling a fantasy land filled with romantic bridges and canals, she hates living there and is feeling depressed. Before when she lived in Spain, she was so much more content than in the bustling hub of Amsterdam; after work, people in Granada would go out for tapas while those in Amsterdam hurried home. Now, she feels lonely. As a native of Slovakia ( Central Europe), I understand her. For example, on public transportation, people are generally quiet and focused on reading or their own thoughts. In contrast, Spain is loud and lively; conversation fills the air everywhere you go. Perhaps the difference can be attributed to the weather — sunny climates tend to bring out friendlier, more communicative behavior in people, and on the other hand cold climates make us feel withdrawn and silent. But there is one thing that the Netherlands and Slovakia have in common that I can’t ignore: a thriving capitalist society. When my friend aired her concerns about the city of Amsterdam, I shared my own feelings about living in America once upon a time with one thing in common — loneliness. We agreed that consumerism seemed to be at the heart of those countries. "

I love a good souvenir, but I don’t really have a collection of any one particular thing. My favourite souvenir is of course my handwritten journal. I hold it very dear to my heart. It also serves the purpose of a scrapbook filled all the little things I like along the way like tickets, postcards and wristbands. Then I remembered another thing I have scrapped in there. Local currency! On our last big trip through Mexico and Central America, every time we left a country, I glued an envelope into my journal and put a local note in there. I wrote what it was worth at the time and any little notes about it that came to mind about the local currency. I realised that this is such a perfect little time capsule as nothing is subject to change quick like currency and what a wonderful thing these are to look back on in future years to come. So, for this month’s challenge I thought that I would piece these together to form a little currency time capsule through Mexico and Central America in 2021/2022! At the time of this trip £1 was worth about $27.81 pesos. It’s funny seeing the dollar $ sign everywhere not meaning the American dollar but the Mexican peso. We learned that actually the peso used this symbol first, it’s were it originally belongs! For the first month of the trip we were consistently coming in under budget which was fantastic. It wasn’t until we reached the tourist region of the Yucatan where this all changed and changed rapidly. Prices rose, and we came in drastically over budget with ease. We likened it to “London prices” compared the rest of the UK. Tulum was a real shock to… "

Every other temple we had visited so far, we had explored independently, learning from the information dotted about and what was written in our guidebooks. Now and then, we would overhear an interesting story or historical fact from a passing tour guide. Feeling a little FOMO, we decided for our next temple we would treat ourselves and splash out on a guide. Tikal is the ruins of an ancient city of the powerful Mayan kingdom set in the Guatemalan rainforest. We’d heard that Tikal in Guatemala was the crowning jewel of Mayan ruins, so what better place to learn as much as possible about the Mayans?! They weren’t wrong. It truly is a beautiful crowning jewel. This was by far my favourite of the Mayan ruins we visited. I just loved the setting; the temples were truly nestled in the jungle. Some had been recovered and excavated to their former glory, but others had been left to show how they looked when the site was first rediscovered. They were strangled and smothered by the jungle undergrowth. There was one that we almost wandered straight past, looking more like a mossy hill than an archaeological gem. The irony is that we learned less about Tikal than anywhere else, pretty much next to nothing. Our guide who we were so excited to finally have was a strange, angry, jaded man who despised tourists. Why he was in this line of work was beyond me. If you wish to see the sunset at Tikal, you have to book a guide for safety reasons (apparently there have been some unfortunate incidents of tourists not being able to find their way out in the dark). A couple innocently asked if they could spend the first part of the tour exploring on their own before re-joining us for sunset. A dark cloud settled over our guides face.

She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot.

Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied.

Chronic knee pain stopped me from enjoying many fun aspects of life. Hiking, team sports, and as I got older, even stairs would spark a symphony of cracks and pops. Here’s how I bulletproofed my knees, hips, and ankles, for free, with one simple exercise practiced a few times per week. Today, chronic knee pain is a way of life for 25% of adults. Yet, most people aren’t born with degenerative knee diseases. And, our joints weren’t made to give way after just a few decades. The problem is our way of life. We sit too much, work too much, and exercise the same parts of our bodies over and over again. Missing the parts that really matter. How often have you heard someone say this? Probably about as often as you hear bodybuilders complain about shoulder pain or runners suffering from shin splints. The knees are the body’s 2 largest joints, and we use them for almost everything. Walking, crouching, sitting, standing, and bending over. Yet, most people don’t know how to strengthen them. Or, keep them healthy… Humans weren’t built to be the biggest or strongest mammals on Earth. But, our unique knee joints have given us a biological advantage over the rest of the animal kingdom. Yet we squander our gift. We walk primarily on flat ground, take elevators, and avoid movements that strengthen our knees. All of this, causes us to devolve much quicker than nature intended. Resulting in knee pain, painful surgeries, and the limiting belief that you were born with “bad knees”. "

We were told it was 40 kilometers from the airport. When we were close to the ashram we saw the beautiful Nilgiri Hills as we were at its foothills. There was open space and immediately we could breathe fresh air away from the maddening crowd. It looked like a very peaceful place that was completely isolated from the town and had its own township of volunteers and visitors. Soon we were at the reception which was a busy place. We got a room allotted to us which was fairly comfortable. We freshened up and our volunteer guide took us meandering in crooked places and uneven surfaces but we could not reach our destination. We then saw bullock carts that were transporting people and asked for a ride to reach our destination. It left us halfway and then we had to again walk on uneven land to reach the Adi Yogi statue where the sound and light show takes place. This was a striking and towering image of Adi Yogi. It was considered to be one of the most sought-after statues in Coimbatore and people visited it from far and near all over the world. Adi Yogi is considered the originator and propagator of yoga, meditation, and spiritual practices in Hindu mythology. Sadguru had a dream of making a very high statue in Tamilnadu. What better than placing it in his own ashram? He built a 112 ft beautiful statue. The height symbolizes the 112 possibilities to attain moksha (liberation) spoken about in yogic culture. The height of the statue also represents the 112 chakras in the human system. Adi Yogi’s message consists of the journey towards self-discovery, inner balance, and a harmonious union of the individual self with the cosmos. "

Every time I touch the old granite walls, I can almost feel the roar of the great battles of old and how these stones hold the memory of those who came before us. I remember how my grandfather used to take me on walks through the grounds of Guimarães Castle while telling me all these great stories of bygone times. I would hold his hand and listen in awe. My vivid imagination would do the rest, and I’d see myself as a knight strolling the keep or an archer keeping watch on the donjon. Afterward, back home, I would build these high ramparts and the inner walls with my LEGO bricks. I still recall the many glorious LEGO battles fought for the treasure chests hidden under lock and key in the high tower of the castle’s keep. Portugal has a rich and diverse history, and our castles are the granitic mementos of the country’s glorious past. Today, they still daunt my imagination and seize the hearts of travelers and history enthusiasts from around the world. Let’s take a look at some of my favorites. The first time I traveled to Lisbon, I had to take a short detour and visit a charming little town on the outskirts. If you have never been to Sintra, you are missing some of the most beautiful sites in Portugal. This is a place of magic, mystery, and mysticism. Its woods still hold secrets of ancient pagan rituals and folktales that have seduced esotericists and other fans of the occult and inspired Portuguese writers for centuries. The locals have a special name for the Sintra mountain; they call it Monte da Lua (the Moon Hill). I was once among those who dared to venture into the hills at night. I was drawn to stories of fairies and ghostly princesses roaming the hills in search of their long-lost love. "

It’s well since you got your period you need another sonogram/biopsy, and follow-up. Also, your cholesterol is high, your sugar is high, and your blood pressure is very low — are you even alive? It’s you better change your diet or you’ll have a heart attack/become diabetic/croak. Don’t eat rice, cheese, meat, or bread, but don’t lose weight because you’re already too thin with no blood pressure and seem somewhat dead. It’s “You’re 53?!

Some go all the way back to the 1600s and can be found in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, published in 1796. Others are more modern, compiled lovingly in Green’s Dictionary of Slang. I’m reviewing twelve of those slang terms from the past to decide if they still make sense today. We made milk, so we were nothing but factories in the eyes of those who saw our breasts as efficient milk manufacturing plants. This one, though crude, I can actually get behind. This one was famously used by Henry VIII as he tried to capture Anne Boleyn’s heart. Is it because a woman’s bosom is soft, like a duck’s head? Is it because if you squeeze a duck or a breast there will be a surprised noise? We may never know. What we do know is that a good set of ducks can upend a country, with the right corset.

Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems. The signs started pretty soon after they celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary. "

Remember my moaning, whinging, and incessant whining about how biblically heavy and unwieldy the 16-inch MacBook Pro is? Well, it has been replaced by a brand-new 14-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro. I said I’d do it, didn’t I? There’s just one problem — I’ve made a mistake, which has resulted in said 14-inch MacBook Pro immediately winging its way through the Apple returns process. I’ll explain how I’ve cocked up in this M3 Max MacBook Pro review — after I’ve given you my thoughts on Apple’s latest powerhouse laptop. Oh, and I think I’ve worked out who should — and who definitely shouldn’t — buy this thing. It’s all about the new colour, isn’t it? Let’s not kid ourselves. Every single review you’ve watched or read about the M3 MacBook Pro (bar those that focus on the base model) features a Space Black laptop. Because of course it does. Is it black? No, not at all. It’s a deep, deep shade of grey. Does that matter? No, not at all. It just looks very cool and you’ll want one as soon as you see it in person. As for fingerprints and smudges, it fares better than the Midnight MacBook Air, but I need longer with it to see how often the cloth needs to come out. I’ve been testing an M3 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB of unified memory and a 2TB SSD. It’s a beast — because of course it is. It’s also an incredibly expensive machine — £4,199 of my hard-earned English pounds, to be exact. Despite the astronomical cost of entry, these are the best MacBook Pros Apple has ever produced. They’re retro-chunky without feeling ancient, built like tanks, powerful enough to smash through any computing requirement, and will last for an extremely long time. But that’s the problem for Apple; this has been the case since the introduction of the M1-based MacBook Pro in 2021 — it was so far ahead of its time and so powerful that anyone who invested in that generation has no need whatsoever to upgrade to the M3 version.

It’s been a year since the company was sold and the CEO and founder moved on to his next chapter. But we’re happy to see that the quality that TB was known for still remains in place. Today we’re reviewing the Trinity, a shoulder laptop bag and briefcase that also converts to backpack, while still maintaining that level of organization and build quality. Disclaimer: This bag was provided to us by Tom Bihn as a sample to review. We are grateful for the chance to try out the bag, but as always, our reviews contain our honest opinions based on real usage, including both positives and negatives. The Trinity is a shoulder bag first and a backpack second. It comes with a detachable shoulder sling as well as detachable backpack shoulder straps, though you can hide the shoulder straps when not in use without having to detach them. It has 4 main compartments: a clothing compartment, laptop compartment, storage/water bottle compartment, and admin compartment. While the laptop sleeve is a standard U-shaped zipper, the clothing and additional storage compartments are clamshell opening, and the admin compartment is access via a horizontal top-access zipper. Though the Trinity is listed at 21 L, it packs more like an 18 L bag. The partitions between compartments are padded and take away some internal volume and there is no single space that is large enough to act as a main compartment. TB promotes this bag as a “triple threat of carry-ons” and I would concur that it is a great companion bag for travel. However, it would not be your primary luggage. If you’re a light packer, you can use this bag for an overnight trip, but it’s probably limited to just one night, e.g., a short business trip. I can comfortably fit everything for work (laptop, charger, notebook, water bottle, mouse, headset, glasses case, and other small items) plus a change of clothes for the office (chinos, shirt, undershirt, socks) and something for sleeping (t-shirt and shorts). I can squeeze my wireless keyboard in there as well, but it’s a bit tight with all the clothes. Unfortunately, there’s no room for shoes. Overall, the Trinity is excellent for someone in the office and as a work travel companion. Strengths Weaknesses One of the key markers of TB bags is the vast amount of organizational features they offer in most of their bags. The Trinity boasts the same. The Trinity is 10.75 x 16 x 11.4 inches when filled (27 x 41 x 29 cm) and 21 L in volume. It, however, does not pack as efficiently as some other bags of a similar volume, and therefore may not feel like you can fit as much, as mentioned at the beginning of this review. After a few weeks of use, I stopped carrying my wireless keyboard because with too many bulky items (I’m already carrying a laptop and water bottle), the bag feels a bit clunky, though as mentioned at the beginning, it CAN all fit. The Trinity comes in at 2.8 lbs, which is not too heavy considering how many partitions it has. The exterior is 630D high tenacity ballistic nylon with a 2x2 weave. You can read more into what that means in our post on fabrics, here. The interior of the one I have (Burnt Orange exterior) is 210D Cerylon high tenacity ripstop nylon. Some SKUs are 200D Halcyon/ripstop nylon instead. These are good choices for fabrics, as they are a good balance of durable without getting too heavy. The zippers are all YKK with #10 RC water-repellent coil zipper on the main compartments and #8 RC water-repellent coil zippers on the other pockets. The other hardware are Duraflex, Nexus, and Woojin buckles, and all feel nice and sturdy. I have no concerns about the durability of the Trinity. The back panel and backpack straps have a thin layer of padding. The padding in the straps only go halfway down, though. For people with larger shoulders, the spot where the padding stops may still be on top of your shoulders (or even before they reach the top of your shoulders). So the shoulder strap padding doesn’t really provide any benefit. I understand that the shoulder straps needed reduced padding to make them packable, but I think they cut down a little too much. Maybe padding three-quarters of the way down the shoulder straps would have been just enough. The back panel has no mesh or airflow channels, which isn’t surprising since this is primarily a briefcase / shoulder bag. So, it’s not the most comfortable bag in backpack mode, but it’s not terrible either, considering there isn’t really enough volume for the bag to get super heavy. The single strap when in shoulder bag mode has a movable padding which uses the same padding. However, since the pad can slide along the shoulder strap, you can ensure that the padding sits on your shoulder. The pad is also lined with rubber on the bottom so that it doesn’t slide around on your shoulder, which is super clutch. Being a bag with a briefcase mode, the Trinity stands upright on its own pretty well. There are times, depending on how you pack it, where it can fall forward, though. So, don’t stand it on the edge of your desk of chair facing outward. Over my 1.5 months of using the Trinity, I learned that the hard way… a few times. Lastly, there are a lot of zippers on the Trinity (10 on the exterior). With that many metal zippers jingling around, the bag can be pretty noisy. Adding the paracord zipper pulls that TB provides helps a bit, but you can still hear this bag come from far away. So if you’re ever trying to ninja your way into a meeting that you are late to, make sure you hold down the zippers so they don’t give you away (or just snip them off and add pulls directly onto the sliders). The Tom Bihn Trinity is a super organized and durable bag. It is ideal for someone who spends a lot of time in the office and wants to bring that level of organization when they travel too. It offers a lot of versatility, as TB bags often do. It’s not ideal for someone who would want to use it as a backpack primarily and a briefcase/shoulder bag secondarily, or for someone who carries a lot of bulky items in their everyday load. Features: 4 of 5 — While the Trinity has nothing truly innovative, there are plenty of features and those are well-designed. Organization: 5 of 5 — It’s hard to get more organization that the plethora of pockets and the admin compartment that the Trinity provides. Construction: 4 of 5 — The craftsmanship of the Trinity feels top notch, as it always does with TB. The fabrics used are a good balance of durability and weight. Aesthetics: 3 of 5 — TB bags never aim for being the most beautiful thing out there. They aim for function over form. But the Trinity still has a nice simple look that makes it suitable for a professional or casual setting. Comfort: 2 of 5 — I supposed you can’t really complain about the padding in briefcase or shoulder bag mode, but the padding on the back panel and backpack shoulder straps are lacking. Life Integration: 4 of 5 — The Trinity is easy to use and once you get used to how you want to organize the bag, you won’t want to change much. The only thing you’ll need to try out a bit is converting between backpack mode and briefcase/shoulder bag mode. X-factor: 4 of 5 — TB has a strong group of loyal fans and the Trinity did build up a bit of hype with a pre-order. As always, thanks for reading.

Student, work, retirement, and more. Some of these are a major pain in the backside to get. Others are easier. You can even move to certain countries based on your ancestry (I’ll cover ancestry visas in a different article). In terms of ease and affordability though, I’m going to cover digital nomad visas (DNV). These have existed for some time, but become popular during COVID. Now, many countries have implemented these visas, although some are better than others. To help you out on your journey to living overseas, either short-term or permanently, I’ll discuss some of the best digital nomad visa options available in Europe. This in itself requires an entire article, but it is important to move, and live, ethically wherever you decide to move. Working remotely, earning the U.S. dollar (USD) will give you spending power, which might make you inclined to be willing to pay more for services (specifically rent) than locals, simply because it is still significantly less expensive than in the U.S. You know how landlords work. Once they know they can get a certain price for something they will keep elevating rent to maximize profit. You might be able to afford this, but locals can’t. Doing this has a significantly negative effect on locals as it prices them out of their longtime homes. It is your responsibility to look up rental prices and what the cost of services is going for in your newly chosen home. This will not only help you save money, but it will help ensure locals are not forced out of… "

If you mix bronzer or sparkly eyeshadow into a heap of your lotion the result is an attractive shimmering effect when sunbathing. Sometimes shoes or sandals can cause blisters. You can avoid this by rubbing your ankles and toes with deodorant first — this will stop any moisture from collecting and prevent friction. The colour of dyed hair can change when exposed to sun, seawater or chlorine. A neat trick to avoid this happening is to lightly spritz apple cider vinegar over your hair. You don’t have to wash your hair everyday. Instead add a light dusting of baby powder and rub into the roots — it behaves as a dry shampoo. Baby powder can also act as a brilliant sand repellent. Sprinkle on your legs, arms and body before heading to the beach and you’ll be able to wipe of all sand instantly with ease. > Read more on The Travel Magazine < "

The island is located within the Leeward Islands, lying between the majestic Caribbean Sea in the West and the open Atlantic Ocean in the east. There are no direct flights to Anguilla, so visitors often fly to St Maarten then take a boat across to the island. At only 16 miles long and 3 miles wide, it’s easy to get around and explore once you arrive. Anguilla is the culinary Capital of the Caribbean; there are only 30 square miles of Island but there are over 70 amazing restaurants to choose from. Some of the highlights include sticky barbequed jerk style meats, luxurious fresh fruit fritters and line-fresh seafood — and as France own lots of the Islands within the Caribbean, both Anguilla and St Maarten are dotted with authentic French bakeries. The island is one of few in the Caribbean that remains a British overseas territory. In the past, salt, sugar, tobacco and cotton were the main principles of trade but in recent years tourism has become the economy mainstay on the island.

Dubrovnik, or the pearl of the Adriatic, is a city located in Eastern Europe on the southern coast of Croatia. Famous for its historic Old Town and its well preserved ancient architecture — tourism has boomed in the past ten years. You are able to fly into Dubrovnik’s international airport, which is only 9 miles from the city centre. The best way to move around the city is the extensive bus network that connects all parts of the city. Meals along the Dalmatian coast are heavily influenced by their Italian ancestry, often beginning with a hearty plate of pasta, black risotto or spaghetti in squid ink sauce. The cuisine relies heavily on fresh fish and seafood caught offshore — usually grilled, served with local olive oil, garlic and a squeeze of zesty lemon. Dubrovnik has a spectacular and well preserved history. The distinctive Old Town is encircled with monumental white-stone walls that were originally completed in the 16th century, and a walk on top of them is sure to be the highlight of your trip. A former city-state, Dubrovnik thrived on the wealth of merchants and ship builders, and has developed a rich culture.

Then, I grew up. I met a Lebanese girl and we became friends. There was a novel from the perspective of a Palestinian girl displaced from her homeland by Israeli settlements. There was the War on Terror, my protests, the fact of anti-Arab sentiment, and the undeniable fact that the same stereotypes were present in the mainstream coverage of the Israel-Palestine “conflict.” Conflict. Is it conflict when someone walks into your land, takes it over, and demands you leave? Is it conflict when someone displaces you from the place you always felt you belonged? I don’t know that I would call this a conflict. I might call it Nakba, catastrophe, the way Palestinians do. If I did not consider myself part of a community in exile before, surely I would now. Trauma and war tend to decide for us where we belong. I look at the faces of the Palestinian children now. When a child is raised in hell, that child inherits hell inside their nervous system. That child will live and breathe chaos, agony, bloodshed. That child will remember. The children in the images coming out of Palestine now look devastated. They indeed look as though they have endured a catastrophe. Looking at those children, it is hard to imagine they could ever threaten anybody. Looking into their eyes, there is the whole world of potential, everything they might someday have become. Then there are the walls. There are the interruptions, the intrusions. There is a moment in which everything that child might become is changed forever until instead this child is predetermined to be someone who hates. When a child cries for the mother who will never come home, that child has learned hate. When a child is forced to seek shelter in a hospital, trying to sleep among the noises and smells of babies dying, and then the Israeli soldiers come through the doors anyway and turn life into a waking nightmare.

Her description has led many to wonder about the similarities between HSPs and those on the autism spectrum. Aron’s responses appear to consider autism as it is traditionally portrayed, but do not show awareness of autism as it presents in women (aka the female autism phenotype) or in those who present in less obvious ways. In fact, the description of someone who is Highly Sensitive sounds a lot like the description of what was formerly known as “high functioning autism” or “Asperger syndrome”. For this reason, the spread of information about HSPs could be one of several factors responsible for delayed diagnosis. If someone believes they are an HSP or believes their child is an HSC (Highly Sensitive Child), they will assume that certain difficulties or problematic behaviours are related to the HSP trait and will be less likely to search for other answers — namely, an autism diagnosis. According to Aron, those who are Highly Sensitive are more aware of subtleties in their surroundings, are easily overwhelmed, and are usually more comfortable alone than in large groups or crowds.

Depending on how much alcohol your body is used to filtering, abstaining can be trickier for some than for others. So it’s important to understand what goes on in your body when you first stop drinking. Alcohol is a pretty ubiquitous mind-altering substance in most societies. We drink for celebrations, for commemorations, memorials, athletic events, happy hours, on romantic dates, or even just because. Whether you’re taking a break for a couple of weeks, a month, or even longer-term, the body goes through changes when you remove alcohol from the picture. Let’s examine how your body reacts to the first four weeks of being booze-free. When you remove alcohol from the equation, your body responds pretty quickly. Within 24 hours, in fact. One hour after your last alcoholic drink, your liver begins filtering the alcohol out of your bloodstream so that it doesn’t poison you. It changes the chemical composition of alcohol to acetaldehyde, and then acetate. Now, acetaldehyde is a carcinogen. It only exists in the body briefly until it becomes acetate, but it’s worth knowing. The pancreas also starts producing insulin, which causes an intense craving for carbs. After 72 hours, most everyone, including very heavy drinkers, should no longer feel groggy, tired, achy, or foggy. After a full week, you’ll notice three main differences: better sleep, clearer skin, and a normalized eating pattern. And when your hunger pangs aren’t dictated by cycles of being drunk and hungover, your hunger is more in line with the circadian rhythm of the Earth. You also crave better food, and less of it. After two weeks of improved hydration, you’ll notice a few things. First, your body is releasing its water weight. You see, while you’re drinking, your body clings to any reserves of water because alcohol dehydrates you. When you stop drinking, your body releases that water and you start to pee more frequently and lose some of your water weight. You also stop experiencing acid reflux, and your stomach lining has repaired itself from the damage that drinking alcohol does to it. As you’re not drinking pints of beer and glasses of wine anymore, you’re saving majorly on calories and may start to show signs of weight loss. Not to mention two weeks of clean, deep, and restful sleep makes you more alert, more productive, and less distracted. Drinking alcohol causes higher blood pressure. Around week three, you should see your blood pressure levels return to normal. Not only that, but your kidney health improves, and your risk of stroke or heart attack is significantly decreased. Because alcohol raises your blood sugar levels, which causes the lens of your eyes to swell… Your vision also gets better at around this stage of being sober! Your sleep gets better every night, eating habits stabilize, skin clears, and immune function increases. And you may be able to notice some belly fat loss. A whole month! After a month without alcohol, your liver fat is reduced by 15% on average. That means that you can better filter out contaminants, store vitamins and minerals, fight infections, and more. While your skin has been improving steadily over this month, you’ll notice the most significant difference at this point. Partially, it’s because you’re more likely to drink water when you’re not drinking alcohol, but mainly it’s because you’re not actively robbing your skin of the water it needs by drinking alcohol. Now, there are plenty of good changes happening in your body… But if you’ve been a steady drinker for a long time, you should also expect to experience depression, anxiety, aggression, and a higher level of irritability during your first month without alcohol. That’s normal. It’s your body trying to get you to feed it booze — after all, people tend to drink alcohol when they’re sad, angry, anxious, or stressed. That’s all okay. Whether one week, two weeks, or one month is your goal, your emotional state evens out and adjusts to the absence of alcohol just like the body does, resulting in a brighter, healthier, more alert you. If you enjoyed these thoughts and think we’ve got something in common, I have a feeling you’re going to love the streaming service I launched last year — by wellness purveyors for wellness seekers.

Things are going well. The conversation is fun, flirtatious, and a mutual turn-on. We have discussed plans to hook up. Maybe I’m over at his house. Then it happens. His hand goes to my throat and stays there. I move it immediately, but for me, there goes the mood. He’s just revealed himself to be the kind of guy that tries to choke women without permission. Or, he approaches my body and clearly eyes my rear end. We’ve discussed this. I repeat myself firmly: no. He looks disappointed. I feel like an object. He moves my body around like a toy and seems to get off on the high of power rather than experiencing sex as a mutual act we do together. Or, he has unspoken but perfectly clear expectations of me that do not apply to him, expectations that he gets to orgasm and I should do everything possible to make it happen, or expectations of oral that are not returned. Maybe things have not even progressed to that point. The guys who insist on fantasizing about sex acts, out loud, that I have already said no to. Who think it’s cute or playful when they push back against my stated boundaries. I’m a trauma survivor. This shit is not cute. This shit is triggering. These men act like my body already belongs to them. Like agreeing to discuss hooking up means opening myself to becoming an object in their fantasies, no matter how degrading. Like agreeing to “sex” means agreeing to whatever they want, whenever they want it. Fantasies of this kind of entitlement are understandable. Expressing those fantasies to someone you have never met in person, after she has already said no, is despicable. This particular woman that I am, I have very clear and specific boundaries. Following these boundaries is what allows me, a survivor of incest and sexual assault, to even have sex in the first place. When these boundaries are violated, I feel more than grossed out. I feel unsafe. It is beyond clear that these men do not care about my safety. It is clear they do not care about how I feel, either. Yet without that basic, human level of care, why should I allow their body to come close to mine in one of the most intimate acts on this planet? Why should I welcome sexual intimacy with somebody who demonstrates neither respect nor concern for my basic well-being? I see nothing wrong with being a woman who wants to hook up. However. Increasingly, the price is higher than I am willing to pay. "

There is no point engaging with these chuds, because all they want to do is waste my time and/or drag me and anyone else they can into an argument. (At some point, I began telling people, “What you’re trying to do takes two people. I’m not going to be one of them.” It’s been surprisingly effective.) But a couple days ago, someone wasn’t a dick about it, and I took the opportunity to say what’s been on my mind about the whole stupid issue. I’m posting it here so I can refer to it when necessary (which I hope isn’t often). Despite what you have heard, if you look past the headlines you’ll discover that Covid is very much still A Thing, and so is the flu, the common cold, and other respiratory illnesses. I started masking during the pandemic, because I didn’t want to get sick and die. I have kept masking when I’m in close proximity to other people, large crowds, or small indoor spaces because I haven’t had the flu or a cold or, gods forbid, Covid, since I made that choice. I have this particular strain of Epstein Barre in my body that makes every infection I get significantly worse than it would be on its own. It’s technically an autoimmune condition, and though it hasn’t made anything life threatening, it’s made me real miserable when I have gotten sick. And now I have a really simple way to minimize my risks, while I continue to enjoy sporting events, concerts, conventions, and all the things I didn’t realize I took for granted until Covid. It’s such a tiny, simple, thing and it makes a huge difference for me. It reduces my anxiety, and it just makes my quality of life better. And that shouldn’t matter, but getting all worked up about it is like getting all worked up about my glasses, which I wear so I can see clearly and enjoy my life. It really shouldn’t be any different. It’s too bad that so many people have decided to make yet another personal health choice that is none of their business, that doesn’t affect them at all, just another part of their culture war. And it tells you everything you need to know about a person when they are a dick about it. From a practical standpoint: I took this picture at the Flyers game. The guy next to me was coughing and sneezing his face off the whole game. It would have been so awesome and considerate if he’d worn a mask to protect all of us from whatever he had. But he didn’t. Whether it was just allergies, or a cold, or something more serious, with minimal effort and no disruption to him, I protected myself from someone who wasn’t protecting me. That’s basically why I wear a mask whenever I’m in a crowd, and why I wish it wasn’t such a big stupid deal (pro or against). I see a lot of thank yous for wearing masks in our photos. I appreciate the kindness, but we aren’t making a statement. We aren’t modeling behavior. We are doing what is best for us, period. This isn’t a statement, it’s just a personal health choice. If it helps normalize the entire thing, I’m happy for that passive bonus, but it’s not something I’m spending an action or even a bonus action on. I haven’t heard someone complain that I wear shoes into a restaurant, and I haven’t ever had someone thank me for wearing shoes in a restaurant. I hope it will be the same with masks, sooner than later. It’s nobody’s business, and the only people who are dicks about it are dicks about everything else, anyway. (There is a 100% chance that someone will show up here to be a dick about this. They can’t help it.) I’m just tired of this being not just A Thing, but A Big Stupid Fucking Culture War Thing. So. Mind your business, do what’s best for your health and in consideration of the health of those around you, and don’t be a dick. Thanks for listening. "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

As my Silent Generation (the generation older than the Baby Boomers; there are about 20 million of them in America) mother is still alive, I used to get a good chuckle at those stories as I thought, “Pretty wishful thinking, there, everyone, I’m pretty sure most of the Baby Boomers are still going to be alive twenty (if not thirty) years from now.” And the retirement and long-term care years of the Baby Boomers? Those are going to be long and expensive years. This subject has slipped my mind of late, but recently I heard a story on the radio program Marketplace that covered this very truth. In the story, the reporter talked about her spouse’s grandmother Sue, whose spouse died when she was in her late 80s. As a consequence, her grandson (the reporter’s spouse) had to take over doing her finances and helping her. In return, the grandmother pledged that he would inherit everything when she died. When the grandmother did die, more than a decade later, she only had two thousand dollars left to leave to the grandson. Not many people would do a job (and often a worrying and stressful job like helping an older person figure out finances and costs and long-term care) for a solid decade if they thought they would net two thousand dollars. The hourly pay rate would be measured in pennies. The journalist further pointed that their family was lucky — the grandmother was a fiscally responsible person who had saved a lot of money for her retirement and nursing needs, so the grandson and his family were not responsible for paying for her care out of pocket. (Which is a very real possibility for some families.) All of this is not to say that the only reason we ever take care of people is because we are paid to do so. But with families increasingly stretched by the distances between family members— both literally, as when… "

Why is it happening? One thing seems to be sure, and that is that the hallmark of long-term COVID survival may be a form of cognitive decline. That doesn’t mean impending dementia, but a loss of sharpness in what is now referred to as the “fog” of COVID. According to a Current Population Survey of Americans, there were less than 15 million people in the United States aged 18 to 64 who had some form of handicap at the beginning of the year 2020. By September 2023, that number had risen to almost 16.5 million. And nearly two-thirds of those adding to the total had previously unreported restrictions on their cognitive abilities. A prime factor in the increase in people with a cognitive disability appears to be COVID-19, and while the vast majority of people who contract it make full recoveries, some people who contract the virus continue to experience symptoms months or even years after the initial infection. The puzzle for scientists is what is causing this brain fog of cognitive impairment and what might be done to remediate it. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., symptoms continuing for at least 4 weeks after infection), also known as protracted COVID, include fatigue and cognitive impairment, along with other enduring neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) and physical (e.g., dyspnea) manifestations. Working memory fluctuations would appear to be most distressing and may account for increased applications for disability. Note: Disability requires the three factors of maintaining pace, persistence, and concentration (aka PPC), and the memory impairment shown in COVID patients would increase the likelihood of receiving benefits. For one thing, rigorous data on the incidence of the illness appears to be lacking and we do not know how many people have COVID or how many are suffering its long-lasting effects. As of December 2021, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus illness around the world had risen to almost 275 million. However, numerous models suggest that the true number of cases is three to twenty-four times higher than the number of confirmed cases. "

One of these words doesn’t belong on the list below. Can you guess which one? If you said, “Fryingpan,” then congratulations! You are right! Fryingpan is the ONLY ONE of the words on this list that appears in the Bible. In fact, the word fryingpan appears twice — in Leviticus 2:7 and Leviticus 7:9. As for the rest of this list: Not in the Bible — not even once. I often chuckle at Christians who leave comments on my articles saying things like, “The Bible says this or that,” or “The Bible is clear about this or that.” That’s because many of these Bible enthusiasts haven’t actually flipped through the pages themselves. Their knowledge of the Bible has come from what others have told them. You see, there are a whole lot of events, words, and sayings that people commonly attribute to the Bible, that are actually nowhere to be found between the leather-bound covers of God’s holy word. Don’t believe me? Here are a few examples: You’re a good Christian, so you know the Christmas story inside and out, right? You know that when Mary and Joseph rocked up in Bethlehem with Mary bursting at the seams in late-term pregnancy, they knocked on the door of some local inn and begged the innkeeper for a room. Alas, there was no room in the inn for poor Mary and Joseph, but the kind innkeeper allowed them to use his stable out the back. Except, there is no inn. And there is no innkeeper. Come to mention it, there is no stable, either. That’s right. The Bible doesn’t mention an inn in the Christmas narrative. And there is certainly no innkeeper telling Mary and Joseph that they could use his stable. If you don’t believe me (and some of you don’t), by all means, check for… "

It’s like telling someone about my bad day, and it doesn’t make my problems go away. Instead, I think there are better ways to deal with difficulties and make life better. When I complain, it often feels like nobody is really listening. Everyone has their own stuff going on, so my complaints might not be their top priority. It can be frustrating when it seems like my words just disappear into the air. What I’ve noticed is that when I complain too much, people might not want to be around me. It’s like they avoid me because they don’t want to hear more complaints. I don’t want to be a person that others avoid, so I try to keep my complaints in check. Complaining can make me feel like a victim like I have no control over my life. But that’s not how I want to live. I want to be in charge of my own story and not let problems hold me back. So, I’m learning to take control and find solutions. Instead of complaining, I’m trying to look for answers. If something is bothering me, I think about how I can make it better. This makes me feel more powerful like I can actually change things. When I stop complaining and start taking action, I think I can inspire others. They see me facing problems head-on, and it might encourage them to do the same. We can help each other by being positive and taking charge of our lives. I’ve learned that complaining doesn’t often help, and it might even push people away. So, instead of complaining, I’m trying to be more positive, take control of my life, and inspire others to do the same. It’s a better way to make the world a happier place, starting with myself. "

You grab some colorful paints and a canvas, and you just start splashing those emotions onto the blank space. It’s not just about creating something pretty; it’s about feeling the joy of it, boosting your mood, and getting super motivated. Alright, let’s break it down: You know those days when everything seems a bit too much? Well, imagine picking up a guitar or a pen and just letting it all out. Have you ever finished a puzzle or aced a video game level? That sense of accomplishment is like a shot of happiness straight to your brain. Creative stuff is the same. Whether you make a funky doodle, write a short story, or build a tower out of Lego, finishing something creative feels seriously awesome. Do you ever get so into something that time flies? That’s called being in the zone or “flow.” Creative activities are perfect for that. When you’re drawing, playing music, or even just daydreaming, your brain gets this cool boost, and it’s like all the good vibes are flowing. Think of creativity like a happiness factory in your brain. When you’re creative, your brain releases these chemicals, like serotonin and dopamine, that make you feel good. It’s like your brain saying, “Hey, this is fun! Let’s do more of it!” Creativity is like a mirror for your thoughts and feelings. When you create, you’re kind of getting to know yourself better. What colors make you happy? What stories do you want to tell? It’s like taking a journey into your own awesome brain. So, in the end, being creative is not just about making pretty things. It’s about making yourself feel happy, accomplished, and connected. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your favorite creative tool and dive into a world of smiles and good vibes! "

As a child, I was convinced that plants had feelings. Why? because my father had told me that plants were alive. So I thought, if they are alive, they must have feelings. If I accidentally plucked a leaf or a flower, I used to apologize to the plant and feel bad about separating the little leaf from his mama-(any larger leaf next to it lol) I remember once I tried to tape a leaf back because I thought the leaf would be sad, away from his family.

Back then, if I found myself in a heated argument, surrounded by a group of close friends, it was seen as a display of courage to stand my ground. I dared to stir up trouble, almost a badge of honor. Fast forward to today, I approach conflicts with a sense of maturity. I’ve learned to avoid unnecessary confrontations, as I’m conscious of how my friends might perceive me. The fear of being ridiculed or judged has replaced the bravado of my youth. Ten years ago, I would revel in heavy drinking sessions, belting out songs at the karaoke bar, and making the most of late nights. I had a reputation for knowing how to have a good time. Nowadays, my priorities have shifted. I find fulfillment in working with integrity, living a more low-key lifestyle, taking care of household responsibilities, and spending quality time with my family. This transformation is regarded as reliable and responsible, no matter how successful or wealthy I may be. Ten years ago, my temper was a force to be reckoned with. Once I got angry, it was like trying to stop a charging bull. Ten years later, I’ve developed better emotional control. When anger flares up, I quickly realize its futility, and it dissipates as swiftly as it arose. Time has taught me the value of emotional restraint. In my younger years, even the smallest sentimental moments would profoundly impact me. Now, as I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to bear pain and sadness in silence. I’ve discovered that sometimes, the depth of pain is best expressed in silence, and it’s a mark of inner strength. Ten years ago, I often pretended to understand things I didn’t, masking my confusion with a facade of knowledge. Ten years later, I’ve embraced humility. I may still pretend to be puzzled sometimes, but it’s a way of acknowledging that I’m continually learning and growing. Life has taught me the importance of staying open to new knowledge. Regardless of the reasons behind it, the twists and turns in my life journey, the ups… "

We get so caught up in all the evil going on around us, that we forget to realize how much greatness is actually going on. In our lives, we get so entrenched with the bad, that it engulfs us until we kneel and succumb to it. We have allowed this evil to take over us and have allowed it to run our lives. We may find a time when we have conquered this evil and can move forward from it finally, but we are vulnerable to it always. Sometimes more so than others. This evil that lives in us all and in all parts of the world can take over us once again. We can pause for a second and realize how that evil can cause us so much pain. I am looking back on much, and see how I have allowed the bad to consume and take over this all. It's so easy to be a victim. Wrapped and entangled by these dark thoughts and feelings, that bring comfort to our minds. The past has a way of sharpening us and dulling us it may feel. It can warp us and make us subservient to it, and we can completely live a life as a mindless zombie at times. At the same time, we can also surrender to life and be a mindful, peaceful, and joyful person. The difference is allowing the darkness to consume us versus dancing with the stars in this vast array of darkness. Hopelessness can be our greatest defeat. The truth about our goals and aspirations can beat us down, and break us. As much as we are strong-willed and confident to continue on our paths, we can be heavily hardened to life. This can weigh one down greatly. The heat is radiating, and making it feel like there is no time left to achieve. The competition brings great depression. I guess they were right when they said comparison is the thief of joy. ©Johnny Poitras 11/17/2023 "

We still did not see these mistakes as part of our weaknesses or badness within us, we all knew and understood that it is a process of how people learn. Against the norm of how adults point out our mistakes, our parents scold us on our shortcomings, when seeing their little grandchildren make sweet mistakes brings them awe; the innocence of newness, of being unaware, untrained, and inexperienced puts them in danger of being swayed by a particular emotions when ushered with little criticism or undue scolding. In budding years, children suffer extremely when they’re being exposed to extremity — of abuse, of shame, of being sidelined, and of being made to feel insecure about themselves. The little gestures build up balloons of negative emotions and burst into lasting years of struggling with oneself.

This exploration of “Living the Talk” below delves into the complexities of bridging this divide in a society that often prioritizes image over authenticity. Authenticity serves as our anchor in a sea of social media mirages. The pressure to conform to societal expectations can be stifling, but true connection begins with embracing our imperfections. Peel back the layers, and you’ll discover the power of being real in a world that often values the fake. Authenticity, often overlooked in the pursuit of perfection, emerges as a powerful tool for genuine self-expression.

It’s time for a critical examination of our digital personas. This involves not just presenting the idealized versions of ourselves but also fostering connections built on sincerity, where our online identities mirror the authenticity of our offline lives. Consistency acts as the bridge between preaching and practice. It’s not just about the grand gestures but also the everyday actions that define our character. Explore the importance of aligning daily actions with our professed beliefs. Small, consistent steps build a sturdy bridge that withstands doubt and skepticism.

This introduction instantly resonated with me, evoking memories of my wedding day and its afterward effect. For example, while I found joy in that special day, it imposed a significant financial strain akin to the author’s experience. My wife and I endured a prolonged financial burden, taking out a loan to finance the day’s expenses, a substantial weight on our shoulders during our low-income phase when my scholarship was our primary income source.

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

It’s romanticized in movies, acted out in plays, written about in books, and memorialized in poems, to mention a few. Every old couple you meet holding hands on the street will tell you a beautiful and captivating story of how they met many years ago and fell in love, just like magic. Even more captivating is their boundless love, which has kept them together all these years. These stories melt your heart like ice cream in the California sun. Indeed, they are beautiful and lovely. While these feelings are widespread, I don’t fall for the allure of love. I also don’t buy into the ‘love is in the air’ fairytales. Being inclined towards science, you can guess my stance on Romeo and Juliet — good luck deciphering it. Don’t get me wrong. I have been in beautiful relationships in which we respected each other, valued each other, and genuinely enjoyed each other’s company. But fall in love? — this is like the holy grail; it’s much talked about but has never been found. As magical as love sounds, it can be explained by biology and chemical reactions. Scientists say that when we feel love, it is dopamine and oxytocin playing games on us. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a huge role in the brain’s reward centre. When we do things that we like, such as eat, have sex, play games, or even use drugs, our brain releases a high level of dopamine, which makes us feel good. Our brain also releases a high level of dopamine when we are in love, which makes love pleasurable, similar to the euphoria people get from taking hard drugs or alcohol. Oxytocin — another neurotransmitter active when we feel love — makes us feel safer, calmer, and more secure with the people we love. Love has also been the subject of philosophical discourse. Philosophers from Bertrand Russel to Nietzsche all had things to say about love and romance. I also dabbled in philosophy. "

https://medium.com/the-cauldron/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-is-doing-work-6c7d0b582f2d?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Ever since the Sports Illustrated cover dropped just three months after he’d been on the job, I’ve thought of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver differently. No longer David Stern’s untested sidekick, Silver almost instantly usurped his predecessor’s thirty year legacy, rising to become Basketball’s Pope in faster than anyone thought possible. Just gaze upon the depiction of the man below; he looks practically saintly. Measured, reassured — his smirk belying the size of his administrative hammer, a messianic glow hinting at Silver’s ubiquitous hoops presence. There is a wholesale enthusiasm for the Association’s new Commish, something we haven’t seen — in any professional sport, really — in quite some time. Heck, Silver is so hot, even the Internet’s GIF-making machine has taken notice: A stark contrast with the deposed Stern, to be sure. Though no one can deny the level of success achieved by the NBA under his reign, the relationship between fans and players and Stern was a complicated one, at best: But beyond the differences in personalities and tactics of the master and pupil, what, exactly, has Silver done over his brief tenure to create this widely held perception that he’s been a transformative figure for his league? Thankfully, the body of evidence is deep, and if early returns are any indication, Silver’s path of enlightenment may know no bounds. Donald Sterling has been a noted racist since 1983 (though it seems clear that his views have been formed throughout the entirety of his life). Finally, the inevitable occurred and the ex-Clippers owner did something so explicitly reprehensible — this time it finally made the public eye — that Stern had the leverage to effectively take Sterling’s team away from him. The scandal was disturbing on a variety of levels: Racism, adultery, gender, and class, not to mention the ins and outs of that oh-so-odd sugar daddy stuff — thank goodness for that TMZ tape. Silver did well to hit the kill switch on Sterling’s ownership, but lost in the shuffle of court proceedings and Jeffrey Ballmer’s lighting fast acquisition of the team, was the Commish’s failure to discipline Shelly Sterling, as well. The reality is that she sucks just as much as her husband does, but Silver — a lawyer by trade with an army of even better lawyers at his disposal — clearly realized that Shelly’s ability to oust her husband from control of the Clippers was a carrot he could not afford to lose by beating her over the head with a stick. Questionable means, to be sure, but an undeniably fine end. Nine years and $24 billion dollars. That’s how much ESPN and TNT will combine to pay the NBA for the continued televise the league’s games. It’s three times the value of the existing deal — and when the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement soon expires, players’ wallets are going to be a lot fatter. The new deal will kick in after the 2015–16 season, and, according to ESPN NBA editor Adam Reisinger, the salary cap could thereafter rise to $88 million, allowing for max contracts worth up to $40 million a season. There’s more within the deal that we’ll get to later, but in essence: The Monday morning after an ESPN investigation revealed just how badly the Ravens and the NFL screwed up Ray Rice’s domestic abuse case, Adam Silver called a press conference. It had been just over seven weeks since the NFL first announced a two-game suspension as punishment for Rice knocking his fiancé out cold in a casino elevator, and when video surfaced of the despicable act, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell promptly did everything he could make the issue go away — only serving to further erode the public’s trust. Silver wisely seized upon the opportunity to juxtapose his league’s stance on domestic violence: He’s intent on making good on his implicit promise too. A month after that press conference, Silver doubled down, revealing that the owners were making progress on adopting new domestic violence policies for the league. Change has already made itself felt. Though the NBA’s current policy allows for a punishment only after a legal conviction, Charlotte Hornets forward Jeff Taylor is on a paid leave of absence after his own domestic abuse charges surfaced last month. No further action will be taken against Taylor until the case is ultimately resolved, but it’s an encouraging step to see Taylor taken off the court and swept into the Hornets’ periphery while due diligence occurs. This was the sensible and respectful course of action — a holding pattern for NBA knobheads, if you will. Silver has begin to establish that upholding a moral code can trump steadfast reliance upon the justice system. As with the Rice, that system that can be manipulated if you’ve got money and power. Instead — slippery slope be damned — if and when then evidence is as clear as day, then swifter action can be justified. Silver doesn’t seem to be afraid of some liberal moral public consensus, he’s already proven himself ready, able and willing to answer the call needed. He’s human. And the NBA is fortunate for that. Sure, the latest draft lottery reform bill didn’t pass with the NBA Board of Governors last week, but reform advocates shouldn’t be too disappointed. The changes, submitted four months ago, would see the teams with the worst four records have an equal 12 percent chance of receiving the top pick (slicing the worst team’s odds in half compared to the current system), with the remaining 52 percent doled out in a manner to give the best lottery teams a higher chance of advancing into the top six positions. In theory, such a change would it would discourage tanking, and, at a minimum, the NBA could be like, “Look, at least we changed the thing for the first time since 1993. That said, it’s still doubtful that teams planning to tank would be that dissuaded from the strategy. Still, as Zach Lowe warned us earlier this summer: NBA Lottery Reform Is Coming. Bring it, Mr. Silver. We’re ready. Here’s how Silver’s office works. Soon after the league held a coaches-only forum — during which it was suggested that NBA games be shorter — the Commissioner’s basketball operations folks brought the idea to the Competition Committee, and BOOM, the 44-minute game was birthed. Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer was quick to hail Silver for the experiment: There’s been less enthusiasm for the idea elsewhere around the league. In particular, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and Mark Cuban weren’t too gassed about it. Spoelstra didn’t care about the length of games, but was troubled by the amount of games players have scheduled, especially the number of back-to-backs. Cuban, wearing the fan-owner hat like only he could, didn’t want to see less NBA, period. Budenholzer sounds like a Silver Stan compared to the tempered and nearly dismissive reactions of Spoelstra and Cuban, but if anything, the 44-minute Nets-Mavericks preseason game can serve as a marker to hopefully propel more progressive ideas. Silver not only honored Austin on draft night — the Baylor prospect was considered a likely second rounder until a career-ending genetic heart condition was discovered just days before the 2014 Draft — but he also went above and beyond by offering the former player a part-time job with NBA Cares — which will lead to a full-time gig once he graduates. The gesture was not only genuine, but it was also a testament to Silver’s kindness and morality. What an incredible display of leadership, too. RIP to FirstRowSports, VIPBox, and NBA League Pass. There’s now an “established framework” with ESPN to deliver NBA broadcasts “over the top,” meaning you’ll be able to stream games without needing a cable subscription. You’ll still have to pay something to subscribe to the service — which will be outside of the Watch ESPN app — but whatever: *cuts cord* Right from the gift horse’s mouth: “My preference would be to have a harder cap, where teams couldn’t elect to spend so much more than other teams.” Silver said recently when discussing the Brooklyn Nets and their $144 million in losses. A hard salary cap would likely mean a higher salary cap, so teams wouldn’t be able to grossly outspend each other. That’s a good thing, right? Competitive balance and whatever. Silver’s public openness to changing salary structures and the cap is positive with respect to the tenor of the negotiations to come between labor and management. All that TV dough means that the players will be coming strong to clawback the losses they sustained during that last CBA negotiations. Silver’s prepping for battle now. And wisely, too. For Silver, “going global” doesn’t just mean sticking some billion-dollar outpost in China. It means creating an environment where the NBA and international leagues can commingle and flourish together. While at the Las Vegas summer league in July, he told reporters that the league was considering a mid-season, Champions League-style tournament. He didn’t give any further details, but the idea of NBA teams against other nations’ best is intriguing. It has also been speculated that the tournament might pit NBA teams against each other in some form of regional competition. Whatever may be the case, Silver seems determined to break into new markets with his product. Just two weeks on the job, Silver received high praise from Mark Cuban, who’s been known to tussle with David Stern over NBA referees’ proficiency since the beginning of time. Said Cuban: “There’s been more changes in 15 days, or whatever it is, than I saw in 14 years.” That’s quite a fucking statement! What, exactly, did Silver do to make Mark purr like that? Transparency. That’s it. One of the first things Silver did upon taking office was to start sending teams regular reports on blown calls from refs. A league willingly owning up to its mistakes instead of ignoring them and covering them up? You don’t say! It’s a novel idea that’s clearly been appreciated by even the league’s most ardent critics. As a Sports Management major, I get to learn from some pretty cool professors — one of whom is a former commissioner of a North American professional sports league. So, you can imagine that when he relayed the following story about David Stern, everyone in my class took notice. (My Googling could find no article, interview, or additional anecdote on record to fully collaborate this story.) My professor claimed that Stern went to the Great Wall on one of his first trips to China, and while gazing upon the countryside, he noticed a young Chinese boy wearing a Chicago Bulls shirt. Through his interpreter, Stern asked the boy if he knew what the logo on the shirt meant. The boy responded, “Yes. We all follow the Red Ox.” Soon after, Stern returned stateside, and in 1994 hired Heidi Ueberroth, daughter of ex-MLB commissioner Peter Ueberroth, to go conquer China. (She had first visited Hong Kong as an 11-year-old — her dad made his fortune through First Travel Corporation, which, when he sold it in 1980 to run the 1984 Olympics, it was the second largest travel business in North America.) Heidi, of course, went on to launch NBA China, now a $2.5 billion company with 140 employees. Amazingly, when stepped down in 2013, there were more people playing basketball in China than there are people in the United States. Silver is charging full-steam ahead with Stern’s and Ueberroth’s efforts. Just last week, the NBA announced a partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Sport to provide fitness and basketball training to 3 million Chinese students by 2017. Silver also hinted that the league is considering playing East Coast matches in the morning so that live hoops can be broadcast during Chinese primetime. Silver’s NBA also locked down a marketing and merchandising deal with Anta, one of China’s largest sneaker brands. It’s believed that the league bypassed Nike and Adidas — the two powerhouses of basketball sneakers — to establish a relationship with a company that’s actually Chinese, rather than a “foreign” company that just happens to make and sell its products there. Sure, Silver is probably just staying the course, and getting credit for the groundwork that was laid before his ascension, but so be it. Winning is winning, period. In fact, that new big-ass media rights deal guarantees this will be the case. Silver’s has called ads on jerseys “inevitable” in the past, but let it be known: There are $24 billion reasons why they are coming. Also nestled within the language of that absolutely ABSURD media rights deal (so. many. gifts.) are plans for an end-of-season awards show on TNT. It that means 2–3 hours of the Inside the NBA crew messing with with LeBron and Kobe and any number of NBA stars, then THAT’S FINE BY ME. Yes, Commissioner Adam Silver is enjoying an extended Honeymoon period with NBA players, but he’s earned it. Banning Sterling and taking charge of league issues has gotten him noticed around the locker rooms. (He’s even willing to ban that dreaded sleeved NBA jersey if LeBron James keeps hitting him up about it!) There’s confidence in the Silver’s competency — a trait that will be necessary as the league stares down a 2017 strike/lockout. Sure, LeBron is his buddy now, that hasn’t stopped the planet’s best player from making sure that all NBA players know just how GARGANTUAN that TV deal is. So sure, Silver’s biggest tests are yet to come, but if he remains as progressive and open to change as he’s demonstrated himself to be since taking the league’s reins, there’s no reason to think he can’t steer the ship away from catastrophe no matter how big the waves become.

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

I’m also doing an afternoon session for middle-schoolers at the Stratford Public Library. Politics always requires coalitions. In parliamentary democracies, the coalitions are visible, when they come together to form the government. In a dictatorship, the coalitions are hidden to everyone except infighting princelings and courtiers (until a general or minister is executed, exiled or thrown in prison.) In a two-party system, the coalitions are inside the parties — not quite as explicit as the coalition governments in a multiparty parliament, but not so opaque as the factions in a dictatorship. Sometimes, there are even explicit structures to formalize the coalition, like the Biden Administration’s Unity Task Force, which parceled out key appointments among two important blocs within the party (the finance wing and the Sanders/Warren wing). Conservative politics are also a coalition, of course. As an outsider, I confess that I am much less conversant with the internal power-struggles in the GOP and the conservative movement, though I’m trying to remedy that. Books like Nathan J Robinson’s Responding to the Right present a great overview of various conservative belief-systems: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/14/nathan-robinson/#arguendo And the Know Your Enemy podcast does an amazing job of diving deep into right-wing beliefs, especially when it comes to identifying fracture lines in the conservative establishment. A recent episode on the roots of contemporary right-wing antisemitism in the paleocon/neocon split was hugely informative and fascinating: https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/know-your-enemy-in-search-of-anti-semitism-with-john-ganz/ Political parties are weak institutions, liable to capture and hospitable to corruption. General elections aren’t foolproof or impervious to fraud, but they’re miles more robust than parties, whose own leadership selection processes and other key decisions can be made in the shadows, according to rules that can be changed on a whim: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/30/weak-institutions/ Which means that parties are brittle, weak vessels that we rely on to contain the volatile mixture of factions who might actually hate each other, sometimes even more than they hate the other party. Remember the defenestration of GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy? That: https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-327e294a39f8de079ef5e4abfb1fa555 Even outsiders like me know that there’s a deep fracture in the Republican Party, with Trumpists on one side and the “establishment” on the other side. Reading accounts of the 2016 GOP leadership race, I get the distinct impression that Trump’s win was even more shocking to party insiders than it was to the rest of us. Which makes sense. They thought they had the party under control, knew where its levers were and how to pull them. For us, Trump’s win was a terrible mystery. For GOP power-brokers, it was a different kind of a nightmare, the kind where you discover that controls to the the car you’re driving in high-speed traffic aren’t connected to anything and you’re not really the driver. But as Trump’s backers — another coalition — fall out among each other, it’s becoming easier for the rest of us to understand what happened. Take FBI informant Peter Thiel’s defection from the Trump camp: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel was the judas goat who led tech’s reactionary billionaires into Trump’s tent, blazing a trail and raising a fortune on the way. Thiel’s support for Trump was superficially surprising. After all, Thiel is gay, and Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, openly swore war on queers of all kinds. Today, Thiel has rebuffed Trump’s fundraising efforts and is reportedly on Trump’s shit-list. But as a Washington Post report — drawing heavily on gossiping anonymous insiders — explains. Thiel has never let homophobia blind him to the money and power he stands to gain by backing bigots: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel bankrolled Blake Masterson’s Senate race, despite Masterson’s promise to roll back marriage equality — and despite the fact that Masterton attended Thiel’s wedding to another man. According to the post, the Thiel faction’s abandonment of Trump wasn’t driven by culture war issues. Rather, they were fed up with Trump’s chaotic, undisciplined governance strategy, which scuttled many opportunities to increase the wealth and power of America’s oligarchs. Thiel insiders complained that Trump’s “character traits sabotaged the policy changes” and decried Trump’s habit of causing “turmoil and chaos…that would interfere with his agenda” rather than “executing relentlessly.” For Trump’s base, the cruelty might be the point. But for his backers, the cruelty was the tactic, and the point was money, and the power it brings. When Trump seemed like he might use cruel tactics to achieve power, his backers went along for the ride. But when Trump made it clear that he would trade opportunities for power solely to indulge his cruelty, they bailed. That’s an important fracture line in the modern American conservative coalition, but it’s not the only one. Writing in the BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller and Lee Hepner describes the emerging conservative split over antitrust and monopoly: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/is-there-an-establishment-plan-to Antitrust has been the centerpiece of the Biden Administration’s most progressive political project. For the left wing of the Dems, blunting corporate power is seen as the necessary condition for rolling back the entire conservative program, which depends on oligarch-provided cash infusions, media campaigns, and thinktank respectability. But elements of the right have also latched onto antitrust, for reasons of their own. Take the Catholic traditionalists who see weakening corporate power as a path to restoring a “traditional” household where a single breadwinner can support a family: https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-capitalism-becomes-tyranny-with-sohrab-ahmari There’s another reason to support antitrust, of course — it’s popular. There are large, bipartisan majorities opposed to monopoly and in favor of antitrust action: https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Antitrust_Policy_poll_results.pdf Two-thirds of Americans support anti-monopoly laws. 70% of Americans say monopolies are bad for the economy. The Biden administration is doing more on antitrust than any presidency since the Carter years, but 52% of Americans haven’t heard about it: https://www.ft.com/content/c17c35a3-e030-4e3b-9f49-c6bdf7d3da7f There’s a big opportunity latent in the facts of antitrust’s popularity, and the Biden antitrust agenda’s obscurity. So far, the Biden administration hasn’t figured out how to seize that opportunity, but some Dems are trying to grab it. Take Montana Senator John Tester, a Democrat in a Trump-voting state, whose campaign has taken aim at the meat-packing monopolies that are screwing the state’s ranchers. The right wants in on this. At a Federalist Society black-tie event last week during the National Lawyer’s Convention, Biden’s top antitrust enforcers got a warm welcome. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s top antitrust cop, was praised onstage by Todd Zywicki, whom Stoller and Hepner call “a highly influential law professors,” from George Mason Univeristy, a fortress of pro-corporate law and economics. Zywicki praised the DoJ and FTC’s new antitrust guidelines — which have been endlessly damned in the WSJ and other conservative outlets — as a reasonable and necessary compromise: https://fedsoc.org/events/national-press-club-event Even Lina Khan — the bogeywoman of the WSJ editorial page — got a warm reception at her fireside chat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwdAxOSznE And the convention’s hot Saturday ticket was “a debate between two conservatives over whether social media platforms had sufficient monopoly power that the state could regulate them as common carriers”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwoO7bZajXk This is pretty amazing. And yet…lawmakers haven’t gotten the memo. During markup for last week’s appropriations bill, lawmakers inserted a flurry of anti-antitrust amendments into the must-pass legislation: https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/fsgg-approps-bill-must-support-enforcers-not-kneecap-them/# These amendments were just wild. Rep Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) introduced an amendment that would give companies carte blanche to stick you with unlimited junk fees, and allow corporations to take away their workers’ rights to change jobs through noncompetes: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/269 Another amendment would block the FTC from enforcing against “unfair methods of competition.” Translation: the FTC couldn’t punish companies like Amazon for using algorithms to hike prices, or for conspiring to raise insulin prices, or its predatory pricing aimed at killing small- and medium-sized grocers. An amendment from Rep Kat Cammack (R-FL) would kill the FTC’s “click to cancel” rule, which will force companies to let you cancel your subscriptions the same way you sign up for them — instead of making you wait on hold to beg a customer service rep to let you cancel. Another one: “a provision to let auto dealers cheat customers with undisclosed added fees”: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr4664rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr4664rh.pdf Dems got in on the action, too. A bipartisan pair, Rep Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep Lou Correa (D-FL), unsuccessfully attempted to strip the Department of Transport of its powers to block mergers, which were most recently used to block the merger of Jetblue and Spirit: https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/640 And 206 Republicans voted to block the DoT from investigating airline price-gouging. As Stoller and Hepner point out, these reps serve constituents from low-population states that are especially vulnerable to this kind of extraction. This morning, Jim Jordan hosted a Judiciary Committee meeting where he raked DOJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter over the coals, condemning the same merger guidelines that Zywicki praised to the Federalist Society: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jxc8dp8erhe1q3wpndre/GOP-oversight-hearing-memo-11.13.23.pdf?rlkey=d54ur91ry3mc69bta5vhgg13z&amp;dl=0 Jordan’s prep memo reveals his plan to accuse Kanter of being an incompetent who keeps failing in his expensive bids to hold corporate power to account, and being an all-powerful government goon who’s got a boot on the chest of American industry. Stoller and Hepner invoke the old Yiddish joke: “The food at this restaurant is terrible, and the portions are too small!” Stoller and Hepner close by wondering what to make of this factional split in the American right. Is it that these members of the GOP Congressional caucus just haven’t gotten the memo? Or is this a peek at what corporate lobbyists home to accomplish after the 2024 elections? They suggest that both Democrats and Republican primary contesters in that race could do well by embracing antitrust, “Establishment Republicans want you to pay more for groceries, healthcare, and travel, and are perfectly fine letting monopoly corporations make decisions about your daily life.” I don’t know if Republicans will take them up on it. The party’s most important donors are pathologically loss-averse and unwilling to budge on even the smallest compromise. Even a faint whiff of state action against unlimited corporate power can provoke a blitz of frenzied scare-ads. In New York state, a proposal to ban noncompetes has triggered a seven-figure ad-buy from the state’s Business Council: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/noncompete-campaign-raises-state-lobbying-18442769.php It’s hard to overstate how unhinged these ads are. Writing for The American Prospect, Terri Gerstein describes one: “a hammer smashes first an alarm clock, then a light bulb, with shards of glass flying everywhere. An ominous voice predicts imminent doom. Then, for good measure, a second alarm clock is shattered”: https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-10-business-groups-reflexive-anti-worker-demagogy/ Banning noncompetes is good for workers, but it’s also unambiguously good for business and the economy. They “reduce new firm entry, innovation by startups, and the ability of new firms to grow.” 44% of small business owners report having been blocked from starting a new company because of a noncompete; 35% have been blocked from hiring the right person for a vacancy due to a noncompete. : https://eig.org/noncompetes-research-brief/ As Gerstein writes, it’s not unusual for the business lobby to lobby against things that are good for business — and lobby hard. The Chamber of Commerce has gone Hulk-mode on simple proposals to adapt workplaces for rising temperatures, acting as though permitting “rest, shade, water, and gradual acclimatization” on the jobsite will bring business to a halt. But actual businesses who’ve implemented these measures describe them as an easy lift that increases productivity. The Chamber lobbies against things its members support — like paid sick days. The Chamber complains endlessly about the “patchwork” of state sick leave rules — but scuttles any attempt to harmonize these rules nationally, even though members who’ve implemented them call them “no big deal”: https://cepr.net/report/no-big-deal-the-impact-of-new-york-city-s-paid-sick-days-law-on-employers/ The Chamber’s fight against American businesses is another one of those fracture lines in the conservative coalition. Working with far right dark money groups, they’ve worked in statehouses nationwide to roll back child labor laws: https://www.epi.org/blog/florida-legislature-proposes-dangerous-roll-back-of-child-labor-protections-at-least-16-states-have-introduced-bills-putting-children-at-risk/ They also fight tooth-and-nail against minimum wage rises, despite 80% of their members supporting them: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/04/leaked-documents-show-strong-business-support-for-raising-the-minimum-wage/ The spectacle of Republicans in disarray is fascinating to watch and even a little exciting, giving me hope for real progressive gains. Of course, it would help if the Democratic coalition wasn’t such a mess.

As my Silent Generation (the generation older than the Baby Boomers; there are about 20 million of them in America) mother is still alive, I used to get a good chuckle at those stories as I thought, “Pretty wishful thinking, there, everyone, I’m pretty sure most of the Baby Boomers are still going to be alive twenty (if not thirty) years from now.” And the retirement and long-term care years of the Baby Boomers? Those are going to be long and expensive years. This subject has slipped my mind of late, but recently I heard a story on the radio program Marketplace that covered this very truth. In the story, the reporter talked about her spouse’s grandmother Sue, whose spouse died when she was in her late 80s. As a consequence, her grandson (the reporter’s spouse) had to take over doing her finances and helping her. In return, the grandmother pledged that he would inherit everything when she died. When the grandmother did die, more than a decade later, she only had two thousand dollars left to leave to the grandson. Not many people would do a job (and often a worrying and stressful job like helping an older person figure out finances and costs and long-term care) for a solid decade if they thought they would net two thousand dollars. The hourly pay rate would be measured in pennies. The journalist further pointed that their family was lucky — the grandmother was a fiscally responsible person who had saved a lot of money for her retirement and nursing needs, so the grandson and his family were not responsible for paying for her care out of pocket. (Which is a very real possibility for some families.) All of this is not to say that the only reason we ever take care of people is because we are paid to do so. But with families increasingly stretched by the distances between family members— both literally, as when… "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

But this subject line stopped me cold: What fresh witchcraft was this? I clicked frantically and scanned the email. It was real. My story, Bouncing Back from the Great Bread Baking Flop, had somehow been chosen for the coveted boost. I leaned back in my chair, stunned. This rambling tale of my abysmal baking fail was hardly my best work. Yet here it was, plucked from obscurity by the story gods. In just two days of boosting, I’d earned $32 and received over 100 member reads. I gawked at the stats, wondering if I was hallucinating. Without the boost, my stories normally saunter along at a leisurely pace. The boost shot my story into the stratosphere like a comet, blazing through the Medium atmosphere. In comparison, here are some stats for a normal story: "

So when I decided to try my hand at baking artisan bread, I dove in excitedly thinking it would be simple enough. Oh how wrong I was. I carefully followed the recipe, kneading the dough until smooth. I let it rise for hours until doubled in size, punching it down and shaping it gently into a round loaf. But when it emerged from the oven, my masterpiece was flat as a pancake. It looked nothing like the picture-perfect loaves I had envisioned. I was crestfallen, staring at this bread Frisbee and wondering where I went wrong. Maybe the yeast was dead or I didn’t knead it enough? I was ready to throw in the towel and call it quits on this baking endeavor. It’s a fresh start to try again. This flop was a chance to pinpoint what didn’t work and improve my technique. I decided to get back on the bread wagon, armed with more knowledge. The second attempt wasn’t perfect, but progress was made. The third try came out beautifully golden and crusty. And the fourth was the charm, a mouthwatering masterpiece. With each try, I learned more about the science of bread and adjusted my methods. Turns out failure was my greatest baking teacher, giving me the motivation to keep experimenting until I got it right. Failure just means I’m one step closer to success if I keep adjusting my recipe and refusing to give up. Rather than… "

Whoever came up with this phrase clearly hasn’t experienced difficulties lately. Life isn’t handing out juicy, ripe lemons. It’s pelting us with shriveled, moldy ones it found at the back of the fridge last year. But have you actually tried to extract juice from those shriveled, forgotten lemons? I have, and let me tell you — it’s no easy feat. That sour juice requires heaps of sugar just to become palatable. And even then, the bitter aftertaste still lingers. No amount of artificial sweetener can truly mask the taste of disappointment. So sometimes, it’s perfectly understandable to skip the lemonade and walk away instead. But that glosses over the cuts and scrapes accumulated along the way. Before making lemonade, you have to pick the lemons up off the ground where you slipped on them. You have to rinse the dirt off before you can even think of cutting them open. It chucks them at our heads when we least expect it. When you’re seeing stars, it takes a while before you can think about making lemonade. Sometimes you need to step back, put your foot down and say Once you get your grumbles out, then you can start to think of the possibilities. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for needing to vent first. "

But honestly? I never feel inspired after hearing that. If anything, it kind of stresses me out. What would you do? Skydive? No thanks. Eat an entire cake? Tempting, but no. Quit your job and book a one-way ticket to Bora Bora? As fun as that sounds, it also seems utterly impractical. If I knew I only had one day left, the responsible part of my brain would kick into overdrive. I’d likely spend the day making sure my affairs were in order — updating my will, making final arrangements, saying proper goodbyes to friends and family. I mean, could you really spend your final day relaxing on the beach in Maui knowing you still have some loose ends to tie up? I get that the saying isn’t meant to be taken completely literally. It’s about living with passion and purpose, not throwing all caution to the wind. But for me, it still evokes more anxiety than inspiration. Take that trip you’ve been putting off, but make sure your pet sitter is lined up first. Switch careers if you’re called to do so, but have a financial cushion ready. Live boldly and freely, but not so freely that everything falls apart the moment you’re gone. Find a balance between responsible preparation and passionate living. That may not mean quitting your job to move across the world tomorrow. But it does mean appreciating each moment, pursuing what sets your soul on fire, and never taking for granted the gift of being here at all. Rather than living recklessly, as if each day could be our last, we should strive to live purposefully — making the most of each day while still planning for those yet to come. "

When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

It’s proof that your writing has real, tangible value. When I earned my first hundred bucks from writing, oh man, the rush of emotions was wild! Sure, it was just a small milestone. But reaching it told me this writing thing isn’t some hobby: I can actually make real money doing what I love! Let me tell you, watching my PayPal balance hit $100 felt like scoring a winning touchdown. I quite literally danced around my living room for a good ten minutes straight. The neighbors definitely thought I’d lost it! I searched high and low for sites hiring writers and pitched like crazy! No gig was too small — it all added up. I wrote for free at first to build a solid clip file to showcase my skills. This helped land those early paid gigs. I tried different formats like articles, blog posts, social media posts, etc. Variety showed my versatility as a writer. As an unknown newbie, I had to get my name out there! I utilized social media and small freelancing sites to gain a following. Rejection stung but only pushed me harder. Persistence finally paid off when I hit $100. Slow and steady! Crossing that $100 threshold was just the beginning. Now I’m aiming for $1000, $10k and beyond! But I’ll never forget the magic of that first $100. It gave me the assurance I could succeed as a writer. With hard work and persistence, you can get there too. Go out and earn that sweet first $100! "

I had just come back as a digital nomad from Asia and didn’t pay close enough attention to my business finances. I had taken on too much. Overspent. And had a massive tax liability that could ruin me. I remember sitting in my hostel in Cambodia crying. I felt like I was fu*ked. When I got back to Melbourne, I went to bed every night in March and April with anxiety. I had an elevated heart rate most of the time. Fast forward 6 months, and I am in a completely different position. I am now cracking more than $20k per month. Here’s what I did. Whenever I found myself overwhelmed, I asked myself one question: I would identify the highest-leverage task and give it my full attention. This would force me to suspend my anxiety and stress and just get to work. I am surprised by how effective it was. Almost a form of productive mindfulness. It radically shortcuts my action threshold. Instead of procrastinating I’m feeling overwhelmed or wallowing in my stress, I managed to knock off task after task. After a full day of action-focused problem-solving, I would end up solving lots of problems. Solve what’s in front of you, and the next step becomes easier.

Here’s the best of Carl Jung — condensed into tiny sentences. There are many groups of people who love to dish out name tags, job titles, and labels. But it takes a brave soul to look within, ask questions, listen to their intuition, and seek refuge in their own heart. It takes a brave soul but the alternative doesn’t bear thinking about.

When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly. Etsy is another marketplace and probably the best for selling your AI prompts. They get more than 454 million visitors every month, and these are all potential buyers for your products. Now, If you’ve ever tried selling on Etsy and made no sales, it’s probably one of two things But that won’t be the case for our AI prompts. Because Plus, it’s so obvious that the demand is there.

I also found a shop called Guide pro And at an average price of $4.99 per prompt pack, this shop has made $9,585 in passive income. My point is, AI isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay.

Sophia Lee was a struggling sophomore, looking for a job that could help pay her way through college. One day, she stumbled across a Pinterest pin that caught her interest. A mother claimed she made $10,000 per month blogging. Sophia had a blog. It was the typical one. Sporadic writings when something happened in her life. Only her family knew of it and visited it. She had no idea you could make money with blogs. But once she got that idea, she went all in. She wanted to make it big with her blog. And her strategy worked. Today, five years later, she’s making $120,000 a month blogging. First, Sophia deleted all her original blog posts. This first year, she focused on fast income. As a student, she had little time to write blog posts. And she needed money, fast. She felt that the easiest way to make fast money with a new blog was with ads. So her goal was to get accepted by an ad agency. She discovered that for that she needed page views. She chose Pinterest for this purpose. After all, that’s how she’d herself discovered that you could make money, blogging. Her second focus was to learn as much about blogging as possible. As fast as possible. That gave her an easy choice. She could figure it out for herself, which would take a couple of years. Or spend $100 on a course and be making money in a couple of months. Take note of one thing here… She did NOT have the mindset of, “Let me take this course and do nothing.” She put what she learned at use immediately. That’s where she behaved in a different way than most people. Determined progress. To earn money for the courses, she took babysitting gigs. And every time she learned something new, she would follow it to a T for two months. After that she would adjust. This is another wise piece of advice. Use it as is for two months, then tweak and adjust. This year, Sophia focused on affiliate marketing, mainly from Amazon Associates. Sophia advised against doing affiliate marketing the first year. Maybe because you need more traffic to make it worth it. Maybe because it takes more time. She didn’t say. When you do affiliate marketing on a blog, it means you need to do SEO. Search Engine Optimization. This was another topic Sophia had to learn. Now she masters it, but she wasn’t born with that skill. Notice how all the way through, she learns and implements. Learns and implements. Then tweak. Sophia didn’t understand the importance of an email list until now. I would switch this to the first year. Unless you really don’t have the energy. An email list will become your most important asset. Sophia said to make sure with everything you posted to be extremely helpful. Keep the reader in mind at all times. Don’t write about yourself. People don’t care about you. They care about themselves. Focus on them. Sophia also started on social media. She chose Instagram and YouTube. Both good places to find traffic. Once again, she focused hard. That meant an Instagram story every day. A YouTube video once a week. All that was extra work, though. Because of all the extra workload, Sophia started to hire. She had to. She hired part-time freelancers to help her with her blogging. Now she had a team. In Year #4, Sophia began to create courses and focused on this part of her business. There is good money in courses. Digital courses. Especially when you have the experience and the knowledge you teach others. She also started a second business. One she’d wanted always. An interior design business. Plus, she began to be more risky in her choices. But she made the money now to be able to be risky. In Year #5, Sophia decided to focus on TikTok. She also started more new business ventures. And she switched from hiring part-time employees to full-time employees. It helped her with her work-flow. Why would she prefer full-time employees? Because, like she said, part-time employees do other things as well. When you have someone full time, they are more focused and more involved with your business. Why not? You now have a 5-year blueprint to follow. You know exactly what worked for Sophia, year by year. And right now, she’s making $120,000 per month. Not too shabby. If you’re not sure if blogging is for you, though, why not start with a small project first? Get my “1-Hour Money-Maker” for free here today: "

https://medium.com/stanford-business-insights/research-too-many-choices-can-derail-success-75f61ef10fad?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Have you ever been oh-so-close to reaching a goal but then fallen short or even thrown in the towel, only to become frustrated and discouraged? Perhaps the reason wasn’t a lack of willpower. Maybe you simply faced too many options for making that final push to the end. When people are close to achieving something, whether it’s as challenging as losing weight or as simple as earning enough points to get a free cup of coffee, having more than one possible path leading to success can actually derail it, says Szu-chi Huang, assistant professor of marketing at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Yet when those same people are just starting out on a pursuit, having a number of ways to make progress is motivating and encourages them to keep going, Huang says. Her study, “All Roads Lead to Rome: The Impact of Multiple Attainment Means on Motivation,” was published in 2013 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Huang, who joined Stanford GSB in 2013 after receiving her PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, researches consumer motivation, producing findings relevant to businesses and other organizations that persuade people to buy, donate or otherwise participate. Much of her research examines how individuals attain goals. The big takeaway: What motivates people to achieve a goal is dynamic, changing over the course of the journey, and organizations should adjust the options they offer individuals to help them maintain their drive. Early in any initiative, people wonder, “Can I achieve this goal at all?” and they seek reassurance that they can, says Huang, who co-authored the study with Ying Zhang of Peking University and University of Texas at Austin, and teaches a class at Stanford GSB in consumer behavior. Offering people several paths to follow when they are taking their first steps makes the goal seem easier, encouraging them to go for it. But when people are close to the end of the pursuit, they ask, “How do I speed to the end?” Offering choices undermines people’s motivation at this stage because it makes answering that question harder, she says. “By providing multiple ways to attain the goal, we’re actually forcing people to stop and think and make a choice instead of giving them a straightforward path to rush to the end,” says Huang. “If you tell them, ‘Here are five things and you can do them all and you have to choose,’ we’re interrupting their momentum with choices. They now have to think and make a choice. Therefore, options are demotivating when people have reached the advanced stage of the pursuit.” Huang’s latest findings follow her previous research showing similarly counterintuitive findings on the effect of flexibility on people’s likelihood of achieving goals. In another study, published in 2013 in the Journal of Consumer Research, Huang learned that customers who were required to make purchases in a strict order of six flavors in a yogurt shop’s loyalty program were more likely to complete the purchases of these flavors to earn a reward than those who were given the flexibility to choose their own order of purchases of the same six flavors of yogurt. “People fail to realize that relatively rigid structures can often simplify goal pursuit by removing the need to make choices, especially when people are already well into the process” she says. In field research for her latest study, Huang gave coffee-shop customers different versions of invitations to join the café’s loyalty program. Some invitations gave customers a head start by providing them with six of the 12 stamps needed to earn a free coffee. Half of those in this advanced stage of purchases were told they could earn more stamps in several ways: buying coffee, tea or any other drink. The rest of the advanced-stage customers were offered only one route to more stamps: by buying a drink. Another set of invitations gave customers no stamps at all, placing them in an “initial” stage. Again, half the customers were given multiple ways to earn more stamps, and the rest a single method. Among the customers starting with six stamps, those instructed only to buy a drink joined the program at a 40% rate, compared with 26.5% for those who were given multiple options. The results flip-flopped among the early-stage customers. Those who were offered several options were more likely to sign up (37.5%) than those who were instructed only to buy a drink (21.6%). The findings suggest that people with significant progress under their belt were more motivated to join if given just the narrow path of “buying a drink.” And for those starting out with a blank slate, having more options gave them the motivation to sign up. Many types of organizations typically give customers and donors multiple choices without adjusting them as their clients approach their goals, Huang notes. Companies running loyalty programs give members sitting on thousands of points many ways to keep earning more. The risk is not that they will never turn in their points, but that they will stop purchasing from the company altogether because their motivation to earn more points in the program is weakened by the overwhelming options. Nonprofits let patrons donate in various ways, and even late in a fundraising campaign as the organization approaches its goal. Instead, Huang says, organizations should consider narrowing the options once a goal is within reach. Some organizations are reluctant to actually take away options or design separate programs for advanced-stage customers. Instead, the company or group can simply tailor its pitch, Huang says. A gym, for example, can market just one type of fitness program to a population that’s already relatively fit. Then, when the New Year rolls around and people make their resolutions to lose weight, the fitness club can play up a range of programs to make their customers’ goals seem easier. Analyzing customer data is another way for organizations to determine what to offer to whom and when, adds Huang. A customer with only a few points might wonder if she can ever collect enough to earn her reward, so telling her about a few more ways to earn points would give her a nudge. But a customer with many points is likely to respond to a pitch that highlights simply one way to get to the reward. “When customers are in the advanced stage, you’re dealing with a completely different animal,” Huang says, “so we can’t be static in our communications or in our design of loyalty programs and promotions. It’s a dynamic process.” Now, Huang, who has a longtime interest in consumer marketing and was formerly an account director at the advertising agency JWT, is studying people’s motivations when they’re in the middle of a pursuit. “Many people have no problem starting a goal, but they often find themselves losing motivation in the middle of the journey,” she says. She is trying to determine the effectiveness of encouraging those people with “social information,” such as messages about the progress of others. “Your friends are working out or using a product or donating money,” she says. “Our prediction is that social information could provide that extra push when you’re in that middle stage.” All Roads Lead to Rome: The Impact of Multiple Attainment Means on MotivationJournal of Personality and Social Psychology, February 2013 You can find more thought-provoking insights and ideas from Stanford GSB: gsb.stanford.edu/news.

https://medium.com/stanford-business-insights/negotiation-strategy-seven-common-pitfalls-to-avoid-2e3abeb4c90?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Successful bargaining means looking for positives in every possible circumstance. “If I can trade off issues that I care about more and you care about less, then we’ve been able to create value in a transaction,” says Margaret Neale, professor of organizational behavior and director of two Stanford GSB executive education programs in negotiation. “That’s the silver lining.” Sometimes negotiators fall into traps and leave resources on the table because they can’t see that silver lining. Some common pitfalls are: Successful negotiators make detailed plans. They know their priorities — and alternatives — should they fail to reach an agreement. You must know your bottom line, your walkaway point. In addition, you need to understand time constraints and know whether this is the only time you will see your opponents in negotiation. After preparing your own agenda, outline the same for your opponents: What are their preferences, alternatives, and bottom line? Once at the bargaining table, test your hypotheses to determine what the opposition’s priorities really are. Prepare a written goal and analysis sheet for yourself. Usually it’s not. You may make this common mistake when there is a “congruent issue,” when both parties want the same thing. For example: In the context of an overall negotiation involving salary, bonus, and vacation, the boss wants to transfer a junior manager to San Francisco. The manager is eager for the San Francisco assignment. But frequently, the employee will look at the situation and believe that since the boss gave him a desired promotion the employee must compromise on the transfer location. The employee might actually suggest a transfer to Atlanta. His psychology is: “I can’t expect to get everything I want, so I’ll take the middle.” The boss is ambivalent about the transfer and figures she can get someone else to go to San Francisco. You think it is unlikely an employee in a career negotiation would miss such an obvious opportunity? Neale repeatedly has performed this exercise in her classes and finds that 20 to 35 percent of the students assume it’s a fixed pie and miss an opportunity to get what both parties want. Negotiators need to analyze the biases their opponents bring to the table. How will they evaluate your offers? One way to get inside your opponent’s head and influence his attitude is to shape the issues for him, a technique called “framing.” If you get your opponent to accept your view of the situation, then you can influence the amount of risk he is willing to take. For example, you are a purchasing manager renegotiating an hourly wage contract with a subcontractor. The subcontractor currently makes $10 an hour. You are willing to elevate the subcontracting firm to $11 an hour. Another organization recently boosted its rate with your subcontractor to $12 an hour. You know that when the negotiators for your subcontractor hear your $11 offer, they may think they are going to have to give up a dollar an hour. You must get them to focus on the point you are starting from — $10, not $12. You frame the issue positively by talking about all the ways your contract is different from the others. Your contract has some advantages outside of the hourly pay. The other side will be more willing to risk lower wages for the purported other benefits. A common mistake is negotiating from a negative frame: “The other firm’s deal offers more, but we can afford only $11.” You need to remember that differences do exist, that they are not necessarily negative, and that these differences can create huge potential benefits — as well as big problems if ignored. Services and negotiations need to be tailored to enhance your position with the other side. Neale uses a case study that centers on the construction of a large American theme park in Europe. To convince local government officials that an American park would be a great opportunity, the American developers brought the European officials to a theme park in the United States. Unknown to the American executives, the Europeans were dismayed and shocked with what they observed: highly commercialized American culture blasting from every fast-food bar, bandstand, and gift shop. This was not what they had envisaged for their quaint countryside. Trying to dream up more enticements during the negotiation, the clueless American executives offered more free trips to the U.S. park for an expanded group of local European officials and their families. It was a disaster. Had the Americans had a sensitive negotiator on the ground in Europe, they could have capitalized on the differences in the two cultures and offered a detailed presentation of an amusement park tailored to local tastes, skipping the junkets to the U.S. park. Anchors are part of a bargaining dynamic known as “anchoring and adjustment.” This involves clearly setting the parameters for negotiation. For example, a couple was selling their house for $500,000. The first offer came in at $375,000, which was too low to consider. If the couple had acknowledged the offer with a counter, they would have started bargaining somewhere between $500,000 and $375,000. Instead, they responded that it was not a reasonable offer and told the buyers to come back when they had a decent offer. The buyers came back at $425,000. The seller then countered at $495,000. The buyers then came up to $430,000, but the sellers still didn’t accept the offer. The buyers argued that they had come up $55,000 from $375,000. But the sellers were careful to remind them that $375,000 was not their starting point; rather, it was $425,000, the first reasonable offer. Using that anchor, the sellers argued that they had come down $5,000 from $500,000 — and the buyer had come up $5,000 from $425,000. Both had moved the same amount in negotiations. One more round of bidding had the house sold — for a price well above the buyer’s initial bid. “The point is: You’ve got to watch the anchors and where they are set,” says Neale. Accepting a well-priced deal too quickly can cause anger on the other side, too. If you list a used car for $5,000, you might really be thinking of accepting $4,500. But when your first buyer has it checked by a mechanic and then immediately writes you a check for $5,000 without trying to bargain, how do you feel? Disappointed. You’ll think you sold it for too little. The lesson is: No matter what the price, even if it’s fair, always offer less — if only to make your opponent feel good about the deal. You may come up to full price in the end, but at least your opponent will feel as if he made you work for it. “Never give anyone their first offer; it makes them crazy,” says Neale. Finally, when you’ve cut a sweet deal, never do the dance of joy in public by turning to your opponents and telling them you would have done it for less. Gloating will only drive your opponent to extract the difference from you sometime in the future. Today, flagging corporate allegiances and rampant job hopping make it essential to keep on professional terms with your negotiating opponents. You may find yourself on the same side of the bargaining table one day. You can find more thought-provoking insights and ideas from Stanford GSB: gsb.stanford.edu/news.

https://medium.com/stanford-business-insights/2106c725aa2f?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"The human brain is a sophisticated instrument. At its core, however, it’s nothing but the organ of an animal, prone to instinctive responses. This instinctual brain operates according to what I call the “X Framework,” a concept that emerges from studies on animal and human behavior, particularly those linking behavior to brain functioning. Like our primate relatives, humans are governed by two neural pathways that you can envision crossing in an X formation. The first takes us from a state of high physiological arousal, often manifest as anger, fear, and anxiety, and governed by the chemical cortisol, down to a place of comfort, typically produced by the calming hormone serotonin. The second moves us from a state of low physiological arousal — what we think of as boredom or apathy — toward excitement, thanks to the naturally occurring stimulant dopamine. If the brain is experiencing highly physiologically arousing emotions associated with stress, then our first instinct will be to stay away from excitement and seek comfort instead. Studies have shown that primates under stress, for example, will not pursue new territories or mates. Under stress, humans also hang on to the familiar. Once the brain calms, however, it becomes prone to boredom. It will then begin to seek arousal in the form of dopamine, from the excitement pathway. This is when both you and your baboon friend will seek out new territories. From the perspective of innovation this is critically important to understand, and will help you get the best from yourself, your colleagues, and your boss. Here’s how: Research shows that the best way to maximize creativity is to maintain high levels of both serotonin and dopamine, which will keep a person calm but energized. But how? The path begins with proper rest. A minimum of 30 minutes — but ideally up to 2 hours — of deep sleep reduces cortisol levels and boosts serotonin. That means arriving in bed relaxed by taking a hot shower or bath beforehand, avoiding alcohol in the two hours before bedtime, and turning off all lights, including those illuminating electronic devices, which affect the pineal gland and make people think they should be awake and alert. It also means eating lightly in the evening, and not less than three or four hours before retiring. Digesting a big meal can hamper sleep. Diet matters, too. A high-protein breakfast is easily converted into serotonin and dopamine, while caffeine is a physiological arouser, meaning it will amplify whatever emotions one is already feeling. If a person is motivated, it will help him or her; if stressed, it will agitate — the last thing an innovator needs. Cardiovascular exercise is also critical. When the heart muscles pump faster, they release a peptide believed to help produce serotonin. That means considering a brisk walk before an afternoon meeting — or better yet, walk and talk. Steve Jobs regularly held “walking” meetings. Mark Zuckerberg does too. The serotonin it produces not only will make a person more creative and productive but also it improves the quality of sleep, creating a positive cycle all around. In general, it’s better to schedule your decision-making in the morning because that’s when your serotonin levels will be high. Learn why (answer begins at 1:08): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS4F1U5FuNM Corporations worried about losing their edge often try to force their employees to work “better, faster, stronger” by applying more pressure or using threats and ultimatums. They believe that the stick, not the carrot, will be more effective in breeding innovation. Studies show, however, that stress is a poor motivator. In his best-selling book, Thinking Fast and Slow, Princeton’s Daniel Kahneman explains why. Of the brain’s two basic neural pathways, the first — from anxiety to calm — does not inspire outside-the-box thinking. Workers are so insecure and stressed that they creep along in terror until they find safety. The goal, then, is to get workers engaging the second pathway — from complacency to excitement — which is much more likely to trigger innovation. That shift is achieved primarily through positive reinforcement: encouragement, respect, and enhanced responsibility. Consider two case studies: Some time ago, a successful international consumer goods company that felt it had become too comfortable, tried to inspire its managers by cutting their advertising budgets but demanding the same — if not better — results. Given how humans are wired, that kind of innovation by desperation was only going to be effective among a small group of people who habitually tend to traverse the boredom to excitement pathway. These types naturally translate desperation into a challenge, and they tend to be younger. But for the majority of their marketing staff, it would never work. A very different approach is exemplified by businessman Sachit Jain. A year behind me in our MBA program at IIM Ahmedabad in India, Jain graduated to marry into the family that owned Vardhman Industries in India, a conglomerate that is one of the largest suppliers of high-quality fabric in the world. Like most men who marry into such families, he became a senior manager in his mid-20s. Jain was suddenly plunged into dealing with a textile manufacturing enterprise that had experienced so much strife that a lockdown had occurred at the factory, and the chairman had almost been killed. Amazingly, he turned the situation around — and not just that situation, but host of them since then. How? He started talking to his employees. In India, for a boss to sit at a table with his workers is unheard of. But Jain has persisted in regularly getting down to the shop floor level to find out what’s going on. His method for instilling an innovative spirit in an organization is to ask his employees, “What can you do in the workplace to make tomorrow better than today?” He doesn’t ask them to think about making things better for the organization. He asks them to think about making things better for themselves. On a study trip to India with Stanford MBAs in 2011, I saw a few examples of the remarkable results of this kind of managerial approach. One was the case of a worker who had the equivalent of a third-grade education in the West. He had noticed a problem: Changing the thread spindles when they ran out was a physically stressful job. It required a team of two — one pushing a cart with the fresh spindles, and the other constantly having to move the stool, climb up and replace the spindle, and climb down. The guy on the stool was often taking sick leave because of the physical demands, which sometimes led to falls and other injuries. In his own time after work, the factory worker began experimenting with how to propel the stool so that the worker didn’t have to keep getting up and down. Eventually, he had the idea to put wheels on the stool, and then he rigged up an electric motor to propel it. In a final ingenious flash, he adapted a sewing machine pedal to the mechanism so that the worker could stop and start it at will. The results? Less sick time, less injury, and greater efficiency and productivity. To support the process, Jain drew on one of the most powerful motivators for innovation: social recognition. The factory worker earned tremendous social prestige by our visit, which included a private meeting with him to hear about how he came up with his idea. Other people in the company began realizing: If he can do it, so can I. Democratizing where innovation can come from, encouraging grass-roots ideas, and utilizing social recognition are powerful methods for encouraging innovation. But the most inspiring method is, as Gandhi affirmed, to “be the change.” A manager who takes time to feed her own creative side well is the one who knows how to elicit the creativity of others best. Middle managers with great ideas face a challenge: how, when, and with whom should they share them? Managing from the bottom up is always tricky, and that’s particularly true when it involves bringing something new to the table. But there are several things employees should keep in mind when trying to inspire their higher-up. The secret to success is to determine which neural pathway the target audience favors. Those focused on traveling between stress and calm will be less likely to embrace new ideas; they’re clinging to the familiar. Those riding the boredom-excitement highway will relish a new opportunity. It’s not hard to figure out who favors which pathway; people habitually tend toward one or the other. Type I personalities, as I call them, don’t veer from the groove between stress and comfort. They’re terrified of making mistakes. By contrast, Type II personalities are those who tend to move between boredom and excitement. They typically fear missing out on new experiences and see mistakes not as debilitating but as exciting. They reframe failure as opportunity, and see challenges as something fun.

Here’s what we know about the drug. Marijuana’s official designation in the US as a Schedule 1 drug — something with “no currently accepted medical use” — means it has been pretty tough to study. That remains the case, despite the fact that, at a state level, the drug is increasingly accessible for the general public. As of Election Day 2020, when Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota gave the green light to marijuana use for adults, 1 in 3 Americans live in a state where they can legally buy cannabis. New York will soon become the 15th state to legalize recreational cannabis. On March 28, New York state officials announced they introduced a bill to make the substance legal for all adults and would vote on the legislation as early as Tuesday. Despite the limitations to scientists studying the drug, a growing body of research and numerous anecdotal reports have found links between cannabis and several health benefits, including pain relief and the potential to help with certain forms of epilepsy. In addition, researchers say there are many other ways marijuana might affect health that they want to better understand — including a mysterious syndrome that appears to make marijuana users violently ill. Along with several other recent studies, a massive report released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017 helps sum up exactly what we know — and what we don’t — about the science of weed. Here’s what you should know about how marijuana affects the brain and body. Most recently, a March 2019 study looked at over 2,500 cannabis-related ER visits in Colorado. They found that stomach issues like nausea and vomiting were the main driver of the trips, even before psychiatric problems like intoxication and paranoia. "

But it’s possible that in the months ahead we’ll devise bright new ways to fight back. As the pandemic approaches its second year, the coronavirus has morphed into a tougher foe. Several mutations that scientists have identified in rapidly spreading variants are particularly worrisome. They raise concerns that these strains will be more contagious or be able to at least partly evade protection provided by vaccines and by prior infections. Let’s be clear: No one knows how the next phase of the pandemic will play out. Is a new strain already spreading undetected or lurking around the corner? How effective will these vaccines be in the long run? And just when can we think about returning to schools and offices, or getting together with older relatives again? Some of the nation’s top infectious-disease experts are hesitant to offer predictions. “The first axiom of infectious disease: Never underestimate your pathogen,” Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told Insider. Despite this uncertainty, most scientists have accepted an unfortunate truth: The coronavirus will likely be part of our lives forever, though the pandemic phase will eventually end. Our best hope is for it to turn into a mild, flu-like illness rather than a deadlier, long-term threat. Here, we’ll lay out the key factors that could determine which course the pandemic takes.

It was also hilarious. On Thursday former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani — representing the President of the United States — took to television to decry the outcome of the 2020 election, spout conspiracy theories, and echo disproven lies. One of his equally glassy-eyed fellows claimed that former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez — a man who died in 2013 — helped rig the 2020 election. Giuliani sweat so profusely that his hair dye ran down his face. He visibly spit into the audience during a pandemic. He waxed philosophical about a favorite movie. It was like being stuck in a conversation with a drunken person at the dumbest country club. It was pathetic, and that’s because things sometimes look pathetic when everything falls apart. This is the wail of ineffectual losers who feel their power slipping away. It’s a blustering, boobish bluff. This doesn’t mean bad things won’t continue happening in our country thanks to the Trump administration. They will. With the power of the White House behind them, even buffoons this tragic can do real damage to our belief in democracy. And of course, there is the fact that our nation is in crisis. President Donald Trump has fully abdicated his responsibility to care for the American people during the worst of the coronavirus’ surge. His public schedule remains blank, and negotiations for another stimulus package — which the American people desperately need — have stalled. There is no better way to teach 300 million people that the government cannot care for them than by simply refusing to let the government do so. There will be unmeasurable consequences to this failure. Refusing to help the public in times of great need creates a level of fear and uncertainty that triggers a kind of callous sense of self-preservation. That, in turn, kills altruism in a society, and altruism is how you keep a society together. If government isn’t useful in this kind of act-of-God public-health crisis, people may wonder, what… "

For most of my life, the idea of setting and sticking to a budget seemed impossible. I’d make a draft of how much I wanted to spend for the month ahead, have a loose plan, and end up forgetting about the budget a few days later. One of my biggest goals for 2021 was to get over that bad habit and take budgeting more seriously. I researched other people’s best tricks and tips (using a budget worksheet, putting money in envelopes for the month, paying for things with just cash, etc.) but I found myself still weary that any of those approaches would stick with me. I brought this up to a friend of mine, who is a mother of three kids and prides herself on being true to her budget. She sat me down, showed me her process, and sent me away with five techniques that I’ve put into place this year. The result? I’ve stayed on budget every month this year and even found ways to save an extra $1,000 a month. Here’s what has worked for me, inspired by that friend’s worthwhile advice. One of the biggest mistakes I routinely made when I tried to budget was vowing to spend a certain amount each month that just was not realistic. It was always at least 25% less than what I had spent in the months before. Rather than try to fix two habits (overspending and not sticking to a budget), my friend taught me to pick one goal at a time. Setting a budget that is in line with your current spending is a good way to get on track and organized. After that, you can adjust the budget to reduce spending in certain categories to help you save more. I not only did that but I also made sure to plan my budget around what I knew would pop up that month. Every single month, the amount I budget to spend varies. Some months, I spend more and save less, and others, I do the reverse. The art of creating a budget is not only a process, it’s also something that can be super time-consuming. Even if you use… "

As someone in the blind and low-vision community, the expansion of remote work has been an economic game-changer. Normally, people with visual impairments face major hurdles in the workforce, from overcoming hiring discrimination to securing reliable transportation — less than half of US adults with visual impairments were in the labor force in 2019. A survey by the American Federation for the Blind found that 38% of people with blindness or low vision had turned down a job because of transportation concerns. I experienced this first-hand as a 21-year-old college student. I was a year-and-a-half from graduation and a prestigious daily newspaper internship was at my fingertips.

Another COVID-19 breakthrough could be just weeks away, but this time with pills instead of shots. Two large drugmakers — Pfizer, and Roche — are anticipating late-stage-trial results before the end of the year for experimental antiviral drugs. Merck said Friday that its antiviral pill reduced hospitalization and death, and the company plans to ask the FDA for emergency authorization right away. If successful, these treatments could fill a gap not covered by vaccines: helping already infected people recover faster. They might even be able to stop people from getting sick in the first place. These oral drugs could change how doctors treat mild and moderate COVID-19 cases and “lower people’s risk perception of the pandemic,” Matthew Harrison, a Morgan Stanley biotech analyst, wrote in a September 27 research note. While excitement is building as the pharmaceutical giants launch more studies, don’t expect a miracle cure. If these antivirals do work and are safe — which remains to be seen — they’re likely to help only in certain circumstances. Scientists working on these drugs say they likely will work best as an early treatment, meaning they won’t be of much use to people who are seriously ill. COVID-19 pills are an enticing prospect. They’re simpler to mass-produce and administer, compared with antibody drugs OK’d to treat COVID-19. The antibody therapies are typically given as an hourlong IV infusion, followed by another hour of monitoring for side effects. The three leading antiviral programs are being tested as 10-pill regimens: two capsules every 12 hours over five days.

https://medium.com/business-insider/how-to-recover-after-making-a-bad-decision-at-work-4c71edc87dfc?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"Instead of running away, you can reset someone’s negative impression by learning from the mistake, moving on quickly, and showcasing your strengths. In May on a trip to Jamaica, I was invited for a drink with the legendary music producer Chris Blackwell, at his Goldeneye resort. We made small talk, and I asked him how he got started in the music business. Blackwell, who’d just turned 84, is probably best known for launching the careers of artists like Bob Marley, Grace Jones, U2, and many others. He answered that he had no experience in the music business whatsoever when he started out, so I asked him if he’d relied on passion and good instincts. “I don’t know about good instincts,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “I turned down Pink Floyd, Elton John, and Madonna.” And then he shrugged and smiled. As a successful music mogul, Blackwell can easily be philosophical about having made some poor choices in his life; he’s obviously made many good ones, too, and he knows a bad decision doesn’t mean it’s the end of road. A great deal of career trajectories and livelihoods hinge on demonstrating good judgment and making smart decisions. But life is a balancing act, and we won’t always get it right. So it’s important to learn how to recover from a blunder at work without making a bad situation worse. Here are three strategies that can help anyone mitigate the consequences of a bad decision, and become more balanced and confident in the process. Ruminating on the situation isn’t helpful and can hinder your capacity for analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving. To keep your mind from focusing on a failure, you can gain psychological distance by labeling what you’re feeling. Research has shown that when we consciously summarize an emotion, such as “I feel angry at myself” or “I feel guilty,” we can reduce the intensity of the emotion and regain control of our executive functioning.

I went into 2020 with five-figure credit card debt. Just under 18 months later, in mid-June 2021, I paid it off completely. That wasn’t actually my original intention when I embarked on the project of improving my financial situation, though. My objective was, arguably, to place myself into the best position possible to take on an even greater amount of debt — six figures instead of five: I had decided, at the start of 2020, to finally buy a house. It made both monetary and personal sense, then, to start converting my rent payments into mortgage payments. I would both be building tangible roots in Philadelphia and investing in my long-term financial future at the same time, and if the time ever came for Philadelphia and I to part ways, I would always have a home to return to if I wanted it. The first thing I knew I needed to do was change the nature of my debt so that I could bump up my credit score and reduce the burden of my credit card payments on my paycheck each month. So I took out a personal loan at my bank, for a five-year term, to consolidate my debt at a lower interest rate than any of my credit cards carried. This converted my debt into a standing installment loan rather than revolving debt — which was better for my credit score — instantly lowered my debt-to-income ratio to a fraction of what it had been, and reduced my monthly debt payments to a low enough point that I had a lot more at the end of each month to put toward my savings. I also applied for a slightly larger loan than the amount needed for… "

As four Black women have found, community ties can cut through an avalanche of misinformation and fear. Dorothy Oliver has about six people left to go. Since COVID-19 vaccines were introduced, customers at her general store haven’t been able to stop by without Oliver gently prodding them about getting the shot. And if you’re not grocery shopping, she’ll phone you up. “I have made a million phone calls, I’ll put it like that,” she told Insider. The retiree runs one of the few shops in Panola, Alabama, a predominantly Black rural community of about 400 people, many of whom she says feel largely overlooked by health authorities. But thanks to her and a handful of volunteers, nearly all of them have had their shot. At time of writing, Alabama hovered in 41st place on The New York Times’ list of states in order of vaccination, with about 52% of the population fully vaccinated. In Sumter County, which straddles the Mississippi border southwest of Tuscaloosa and includes Panola, that number drops to 42%. And until Oliver got busy, it looked as if it would have been the same in Panola. The hamlet is about 35 miles from the nearest vaccination center, and people were too fearful, were too disengaged, or simply didn’t have enough information to organize a shot, she said. Oliver was particularly worried for the older folks, who have less access to online information but are at higher risk from COVID-19. So she decided to do something about it. “I said, well, you know what? I need to go head-on and start talking to these older people to make sure that you know — people would put a lot of bad stuff in their heads, you know?” she said. Oliver is backed up by an old partner in community action, Drucilla Russ-Jackson, a Sumter County commissioner. Russ-Jackson pulled together resources from the state health board and the National Guard. "

A 19-year-old manager of a chicken restaurant earning $50,000 a year told Insider what he’s learnt in his first seven months on the job. Jason Cabrera, general manager of the Allen, Texas branch of Layne’s Chicken Fingers, started out buttering toast for $9.25-an-hour at the restaurant in late 2018, and now manages 22 people. Garrett Reed, the CEO of Layne’s, told Insider in a separate interview that he would “usually have at least a handful of seasoned managers, people in their late 20s, early 30s.” However, he promoted three teenagers to general manager roles in recent months as the industry-wide labor shortage meant few experienced workers had applied. Cabrera told Insider his four biggest takeaways from his first seven months: When Cabrera accepted the job in January — one week after his 19th birthday — he said that he took on a raft of new responsibilities, including calculating labor costs, dealing with suppliers, and managing up to eight employees per shift. “Just knowing that anything that happens inside of that store is on me. Anything that goes wrong, anything that goes right, it all comes back to me,” he said. Cabrera said his role forced him to mature quickly. “When I started working I was still a young kid that liked to have fun,” he said. “That was the problem. I had too much fun but I guess as I started getting into the role and whatnot, I matured so quickly without really noticing.” Cabrera said a big part of his job is devoted to keeping customers happy, and he looks forward to every Tuesday… "

We carry them everywhere, from our homes to the office, and even into the most private of spaces — the bathroom. It has become a common habit for many people to take their phones with them when they go to the toilet. While it might seem harmless or even convenient, it’s time to consider the hidden dangers of this practice, particularly when it comes to our health. When you enter a public or shared restroom, it’s no secret that the toilet seat can be teeming with bacteria and viruses. The act of flushing can aerosolize these pathogens, causing them to settle on various surfaces, including the toilet seat. Even in your own bathroom, where you might assume it’s cleaner, germs can still linger. Now, think about your smartphone. You probably touch it constantly throughout the day. It goes with you everywhere, from your office desk to your dining table, and yes, even the bathroom. What’s even more concerning is that these pathogens can survive on your phone’s surface. Now comes the unexpected part. This seemingly harmless habit can be a significant factor contributing to a painful and discomforting condition — hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus, and one common cause is excessive straining during bowel movements. When you’re preoccupied with your phone in the bathroom, you might spend more time sitting on the toilet than necessary. "

Let’s explore the intricacies of bone health and discover practical solutions to maintain strong and resilient bones as we age. With age, our bodies undergo significant changes affecting muscles, bones, and joints. While the structure remains, the quality of bones, especially in the formation phase, undergoes alterations. These changes, accompanied by factors like lack of exercise, excessive walking, and menopause in women, contribute to weakened bones. Menopause marks a critical phase for women, signaling the end of menstrual cycles and a decline in hormone production. The calcium mineral, essential for bone strength, starts depleting, leading to weakened bones. The decrease in sex hormones and the production of vital chemicals further contribute to bone fragility. Osteoporosis, a common bone disease associated with aging, results in weakened bones prone to fractures. Despite the widely known advice of increasing calcium intake, understanding the root causes of bone weakness remains crucial. "

These bloodsucking pests have not only infested hotels, homes, and cinema halls in the City of Light but have also been spreading far and wide, reaching into our homes. Bedbugs, scientifically known as Cimex lectularius or Cimex hemipterus, are tiny, nocturnal insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. As a result, they have a particular affinity for your beds, clothing, and gaps in furniture. Bedbugs have two primary methods of transmission. The first is “local spread,” where they emerge from hiding in walls to feed on a person sleeping in their bed. The second method is “far spread,” where bedbugs hide within your clothing and hitch a ride to different locations, biting new victims along the way. These tiny pests cause more problems than you might think. There are two main reasons why bedbug bites can have an impact on your health. First, they can weaken your immune system. Disrupted sleep patterns due to bedbug bites can lead to stress, causing your body to generate antioxidants and subsequently weaken your immune system. The second reason is the potential for allergic reactions, resulting in itchy wheals. While itching might not manifest immediately, it can become an ongoing nuisance for up to three weeks. "

Back then, if I found myself in a heated argument, surrounded by a group of close friends, it was seen as a display of courage to stand my ground. I dared to stir up trouble, almost a badge of honor. Fast forward to today, I approach conflicts with a sense of maturity. I’ve learned to avoid unnecessary confrontations, as I’m conscious of how my friends might perceive me. The fear of being ridiculed or judged has replaced the bravado of my youth. Ten years ago, I would revel in heavy drinking sessions, belting out songs at the karaoke bar, and making the most of late nights. I had a reputation for knowing how to have a good time. Nowadays, my priorities have shifted. I find fulfillment in working with integrity, living a more low-key lifestyle, taking care of household responsibilities, and spending quality time with my family. This transformation is regarded as reliable and responsible, no matter how successful or wealthy I may be. Ten years ago, my temper was a force to be reckoned with. Once I got angry, it was like trying to stop a charging bull. Ten years later, I’ve developed better emotional control. When anger flares up, I quickly realize its futility, and it dissipates as swiftly as it arose. Time has taught me the value of emotional restraint. In my younger years, even the smallest sentimental moments would profoundly impact me. Now, as I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to bear pain and sadness in silence. I’ve discovered that sometimes, the depth of pain is best expressed in silence, and it’s a mark of inner strength. Ten years ago, I often pretended to understand things I didn’t, masking my confusion with a facade of knowledge. Ten years later, I’ve embraced humility. I may still pretend to be puzzled sometimes, but it’s a way of acknowledging that I’m continually learning and growing. Life has taught me the importance of staying open to new knowledge.

Last night there were two maniacs in a row so I just went back home early but got to work so I don’t mind… But paranoia over my loved one’s intentions is the hardest. Just imagine you have 4 beautiful children and more around the globe and also am a gramma and to believe that they are not on your side is very hard. I believe they are right now but actions speak louder than words as my dad says. Even now from heaven he recites so many mantras I am teaching my India because not many others other than my butterfly nana always will and that is my favorite moments as her fondness for her gpa was such that she visited him with me often even as he lay paralyzed for 5 years on his back but still looking up! I found out later these visits that I cherished were hard for her. He was still my dad even up to the end with our salutation few know. And paranoia over every situation that comes to me. What will they say back to me? Did I mess up? Did I scare them away with my paranoia? Today I might have or prevented a scam? Keeping the trundle bed in the family as it is an heirloom! Very happy! Never paranoia with my dad except once I still don’t understand and don’’t know if I need to because the details are very fuzzy but it was a private moment between him and I and one other who shall not be named.

Knowing when to take a chance and when to step back can greatly impact your outcomes. The skills honed at the poker table have surprising parallels to real-life scenarios. From managing emotions to making decisions with limited information, the lessons from poker can be applied to everything from personal finances to social interactions. Let’s explore how these skills can lead to success beyond the game. In poker, players must constantly assess the risk and reward of each hand. Similarly, in life, whether you’re investing in the stock market or choosing a career path, understanding the potential risks and rewards is crucial. You need to know when to “fold” and walk away from a bad investment or job, and when to “raise” and take calculated risks for higher returns. Poker players often talk about having a “poker face,” which is essentially emotional control. In life, emotional intelligence is equally important. Whether you’re negotiating a business deal or navigating a relationship, being able to control your emotions can give you a significant advantage. In poker, you often have to make decisions based on incomplete information. You use probabilistic thinking to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes. This skill is incredibly useful in real life for making decisions when you don’t have all the facts, such as in medical diagnoses or business ventures. Bankroll management in poker teaches you how to manage your resources wisely. This can be directly applied to personal finance, where budgeting and saving are key components of financial health. In poker, being able to read your opponents is crucial. This skill translates well into real-world scenarios like job interviews, sales pitches, and social interactions, where understanding the motivations and intentions of others can be invaluable. Poker teaches you that you can do everything right and still lose, which is a hard but important life lesson. Learning how to cope with failure and setbacks is essential for long-term success in any field. Remember, whether you’re holding cards or facing life’s challenges, playing your best hand is the key to enduring success. "

However, a prevailing sentiment among them, encapsulated in the phrase “Cold outreach is dead,” warrants scrutiny. This article delves into the fallacies behind this belief, examining the dynamics of social media growth, the gold rush fallacy, and the enduring vitality of cold outreach. The gold rush fallacy suggests that, much like any gold rush, early adopters reap the greatest rewards. Many respected creators built massive followings by recognizing the potential of platforms like Twitter, and LinkedIn. However, the author contends that the days of gaining 1000 followers from a simple listicle are a relic of the past. In the analogy of a whale effortlessly consuming fish, the article highlights that large creators with six-figure followings, social proof, and established authority naturally attract inbound leads. The irony lies in the fact that for those who were not part of the early wave, building a substantial audience now demands more than just opening one’s metaphorical mouth. Organic inbound leads are ideal but not the sole solution. Contrary to the assertion that “cold outreach is dead,” the argument lies in that entire agencies with automated outreach systems are thriving, generating substantial revenue. While inbound leads work wonders, not everyone can sell personal branding courses. Some individuals run large eight-figure businesses, relying on targeted cold outreach for audience acquisition. The analogy of the Prime Minister’s unfamiliarity with scanning a grocery store barcode reinforces the idea that individuals in influential positions may not have experienced certain challenges. Similarly, those who have achieved substantial social media success without engaging in cold outreach may not fully grasp its significance for… "

It’s a great question! And really… why would someone choose a cane when they could have a dog who’d be both, a guide and a companion? The first thing to note: skill at using a white cane is a prerequisite to being a guide dog handler. Before I was matched with my first guide dog, I had to do a test that involved navigating with a cane in a neighborhood unfamiliar to me. The guide dog instructor walked nearby to verify that I had the skills I claimed to have. If my dog cannot accompany me, I use a cane to get around smoothly. For example, if my dog is sick or if I’m giving him a day off and I still need to go out. They both take time to learn and a lot of practice to become comfortable. A cane gives the person info about the surface, an obvious example being the contrast between a sidewalk and grass. You may see someone walking next to the edge of a sidewalk tapping side to side – on his right is grass so, knowing that, he remains oriented on the sidewalk. The dog stays on the walkway, the person trusts the dog. The cane defines contrasts in height like curbs and steps, and it clearly detects obstacles, sometimes by knocking them over.

I may have had hopes, dreams, fears, and uncertainties, but I would never have predicted the rollercoaster ride that awaited us. I just searched on my phone to find out what I did on this day five years ago, and I found only one photo; it is this one: I must have taken it from Södermalm while standing on the waterfront of the Mälaren Lake, not far from my Stockholm home. It was a Sunday, which makes it likely that I took this picture just before starting a run around this part of the big lake, a route that would pass captivating sights that I had visited during my years in Sweden, including the famous town hall where every year on December 10, the Nobel Banquet is served after the Nobel prize ceremony. Where were you five years ago? And a more challenging question: would you have had any idea what the future had in store for you and all of us in these five years? Looking back at these five years, I find the speed, complexity, and direction of the unfolding global events profoundly worrying. And as so often before, I feel like a spectator; in the comfort of a cinema chair, I watch a scary movie, and while eating another hand of popcorn, my eyes are fixated on the angry man with an axe that keeps hitting the fragile door. A tiny disruptor got a foothold in China about a year after I stood on the waterfront. Like Mike Campbell’s bankruptcy in “Fiesta,” it developed in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. When the life-altering COVID-19 pandemic erupted, I was still in Stockholm. It was the eye of the storm and about the only place in the world where we drank our beers on crowded terraces while reading on our smartphones about a world retreating in isolation. The virus erupted globally, took countless lives on every continent, and reshaped the very fabric of our existence. Our daily routines, how we work, socialize, and travel, all changed in a way nobody would ever have imagined. Our world was tested and showed huge vulnerabilities in society.

One of the last lines in the comment triggered my response: “Some continued soul-searching is in order to see what more can be done — personally, at the local level, and through greater advocacy.” Here is my reply: I mostly read about history, and the most captivating historical periods in the books on my shelves are often about challenging times of turmoil, such as war, revolution, or rapid societal transformations. The pages of each of those books are filled with tales of struggles between good and evil. You instantly recognize the bad guys in those accounts who are, unfortunately, quite powerful (historically, they are indeed nearly always guys). They are the ones who aim to get more power and wealth and are willing to do whatever it takes to get there. If you fail to recognize bad leaders based on those characteristics, you may detect them by their narcissism, lack of empathy, and inability to admit mistakes. I won’t mention examples here, but I’m sure you can think of some. If you are still in doubt, just watch their wives when they walk down the steep stairs once their airplane arrives. If you’re the only one watching her, you have found one. These leaders don’t lead and certainly won’t lead us to find the innovative solutions our planet urgently needs to address existential challenges like climate change. If a leader doesn’t care for other people’s needs or the next generations, they have different priorities irrelevant to the ones they pretend to lead.

That is what all countries have been working on for some time. The final phase of the first-ever stocktake is scheduled at the next global annual meeting on climate change, COP28, which starts in late November in Dubai. This exercise will be repeated every five years; the next one will be in late 2028. That is very close to 2030, the year by which greenhouse gas emissions must have declined by 43 percent after having peaked no later than 2025. That reduction in emissions should limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists from the IPCC warn that crossing that threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change impacts. A report published today in The Lancet reminds us of what is at stake for just one of the many warning indicators. An international team of more than a hundred researchers concluded that heat-related deaths of people older than 65 have increased by 85 percent since the 1990s. It’s a development that goes hand in hand with doubling the number of heat-wave days annually between 1986 and 2005. All indications are that we need far more ambition to avoid living on such a hot, dangerous, and inhospitable planet. Let’s have a look at where we stand. A good source is the report “State of Climate Action 2023” that the Systems Change Lab published today. Researchers used 42 indicators to assess the world’s progress towards the 2030 climate targets; 41 are not on track. Six of these indicators are even heading entirely in the wrong direction, and about half of these indicators are so far off track that the efforts must accelerate at least twofold this decade.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems. The signs started pretty soon after they celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary. "

I’m also doing an afternoon session for middle-schoolers at the Stratford Public Library. Politics always requires coalitions. In parliamentary democracies, the coalitions are visible, when they come together to form the government. In a dictatorship, the coalitions are hidden to everyone except infighting princelings and courtiers (until a general or minister is executed, exiled or thrown in prison.) In a two-party system, the coalitions are inside the parties — not quite as explicit as the coalition governments in a multiparty parliament, but not so opaque as the factions in a dictatorship. Sometimes, there are even explicit structures to formalize the coalition, like the Biden Administration’s Unity Task Force, which parceled out key appointments among two important blocs within the party (the finance wing and the Sanders/Warren wing). Conservative politics are also a coalition, of course. As an outsider, I confess that I am much less conversant with the internal power-struggles in the GOP and the conservative movement, though I’m trying to remedy that. Books like Nathan J Robinson’s Responding to the Right present a great overview of various conservative belief-systems: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/14/nathan-robinson/#arguendo And the Know Your Enemy podcast does an amazing job of diving deep into right-wing beliefs, especially when it comes to identifying fracture lines in the conservative establishment. A recent episode on the roots of contemporary right-wing antisemitism in the paleocon/neocon split was hugely informative and fascinating: https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/know-your-enemy-in-search-of-anti-semitism-with-john-ganz/ Political parties are weak institutions, liable to capture and hospitable to corruption. General elections aren’t foolproof or impervious to fraud, but they’re miles more robust than parties, whose own leadership selection processes and other key decisions can be made in the shadows, according to rules that can be changed on a whim: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/30/weak-institutions/ Which means that parties are brittle, weak vessels that we rely on to contain the volatile mixture of factions who might actually hate each other, sometimes even more than they hate the other party. Remember the defenestration of GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy? That: https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-327e294a39f8de079ef5e4abfb1fa555 Even outsiders like me know that there’s a deep fracture in the Republican Party, with Trumpists on one side and the “establishment” on the other side. Reading accounts of the 2016 GOP leadership race, I get the distinct impression that Trump’s win was even more shocking to party insiders than it was to the rest of us. Which makes sense. They thought they had the party under control, knew where its levers were and how to pull them. For us, Trump’s win was a terrible mystery. For GOP power-brokers, it was a different kind of a nightmare, the kind where you discover that controls to the the car you’re driving in high-speed traffic aren’t connected to anything and you’re not really the driver. But as Trump’s backers — another coalition — fall out among each other, it’s becoming easier for the rest of us to understand what happened. Take FBI informant Peter Thiel’s defection from the Trump camp: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel was the judas goat who led tech’s reactionary billionaires into Trump’s tent, blazing a trail and raising a fortune on the way. Thiel’s support for Trump was superficially surprising. After all, Thiel is gay, and Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, openly swore war on queers of all kinds. Today, Thiel has rebuffed Trump’s fundraising efforts and is reportedly on Trump’s shit-list. But as a Washington Post report — drawing heavily on gossiping anonymous insiders — explains. Thiel has never let homophobia blind him to the money and power he stands to gain by backing bigots: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel bankrolled Blake Masterson’s Senate race, despite Masterson’s promise to roll back marriage equality — and despite the fact that Masterton attended Thiel’s wedding to another man. According to the post, the Thiel faction’s abandonment of Trump wasn’t driven by culture war issues. Rather, they were fed up with Trump’s chaotic, undisciplined governance strategy, which scuttled many opportunities to increase the wealth and power of America’s oligarchs. Thiel insiders complained that Trump’s “character traits sabotaged the policy changes” and decried Trump’s habit of causing “turmoil and chaos…that would interfere with his agenda” rather than “executing relentlessly.” For Trump’s base, the cruelty might be the point. But for his backers, the cruelty was the tactic, and the point was money, and the power it brings. When Trump seemed like he might use cruel tactics to achieve power, his backers went along for the ride. But when Trump made it clear that he would trade opportunities for power solely to indulge his cruelty, they bailed. That’s an important fracture line in the modern American conservative coalition, but it’s not the only one. Writing in the BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller and Lee Hepner describes the emerging conservative split over antitrust and monopoly: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/is-there-an-establishment-plan-to Antitrust has been the centerpiece of the Biden Administration’s most progressive political project. For the left wing of the Dems, blunting corporate power is seen as the necessary condition for rolling back the entire conservative program, which depends on oligarch-provided cash infusions, media campaigns, and thinktank respectability. But elements of the right have also latched onto antitrust, for reasons of their own. Take the Catholic traditionalists who see weakening corporate power as a path to restoring a “traditional” household where a single breadwinner can support a family: https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-capitalism-becomes-tyranny-with-sohrab-ahmari There’s another reason to support antitrust, of course — it’s popular. There are large, bipartisan majorities opposed to monopoly and in favor of antitrust action: https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Antitrust_Policy_poll_results.pdf Two-thirds of Americans support anti-monopoly laws. 70% of Americans say monopolies are bad for the economy. The Biden administration is doing more on antitrust than any presidency since the Carter years, but 52% of Americans haven’t heard about it: https://www.ft.com/content/c17c35a3-e030-4e3b-9f49-c6bdf7d3da7f There’s a big opportunity latent in the facts of antitrust’s popularity, and the Biden antitrust agenda’s obscurity. So far, the Biden administration hasn’t figured out how to seize that opportunity, but some Dems are trying to grab it. Take Montana Senator John Tester, a Democrat in a Trump-voting state, whose campaign has taken aim at the meat-packing monopolies that are screwing the state’s ranchers. The right wants in on this. At a Federalist Society black-tie event last week during the National Lawyer’s Convention, Biden’s top antitrust enforcers got a warm welcome. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s top antitrust cop, was praised onstage by Todd Zywicki, whom Stoller and Hepner call “a highly influential law professors,” from George Mason Univeristy, a fortress of pro-corporate law and economics. Zywicki praised the DoJ and FTC’s new antitrust guidelines — which have been endlessly damned in the WSJ and other conservative outlets — as a reasonable and necessary compromise: https://fedsoc.org/events/national-press-club-event Even Lina Khan — the bogeywoman of the WSJ editorial page — got a warm reception at her fireside chat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwdAxOSznE And the convention’s hot Saturday ticket was “a debate between two conservatives over whether social media platforms had sufficient monopoly power that the state could regulate them as common carriers”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwoO7bZajXk This is pretty amazing. And yet…lawmakers haven’t gotten the memo. During markup for last week’s appropriations bill, lawmakers inserted a flurry of anti-antitrust amendments into the must-pass legislation: https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/fsgg-approps-bill-must-support-enforcers-not-kneecap-them/# These amendments were just wild. Rep Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) introduced an amendment that would give companies carte blanche to stick you with unlimited junk fees, and allow corporations to take away their workers’ rights to change jobs through noncompetes: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/269 Another amendment would block the FTC from enforcing against “unfair methods of competition.” Translation: the FTC couldn’t punish companies like Amazon for using algorithms to hike prices, or for conspiring to raise insulin prices, or its predatory pricing aimed at killing small- and medium-sized grocers. An amendment from Rep Kat Cammack (R-FL) would kill the FTC’s “click to cancel” rule, which will force companies to let you cancel your subscriptions the same way you sign up for them — instead of making you wait on hold to beg a customer service rep to let you cancel. Another one: “a provision to let auto dealers cheat customers with undisclosed added fees”: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr4664rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr4664rh.pdf Dems got in on the action, too. A bipartisan pair, Rep Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep Lou Correa (D-FL), unsuccessfully attempted to strip the Department of Transport of its powers to block mergers, which were most recently used to block the merger of Jetblue and Spirit: https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/640 And 206 Republicans voted to block the DoT from investigating airline price-gouging. As Stoller and Hepner point out, these reps serve constituents from low-population states that are especially vulnerable to this kind of extraction. This morning, Jim Jordan hosted a Judiciary Committee meeting where he raked DOJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter over the coals, condemning the same merger guidelines that Zywicki praised to the Federalist Society: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jxc8dp8erhe1q3wpndre/GOP-oversight-hearing-memo-11.13.23.pdf?rlkey=d54ur91ry3mc69bta5vhgg13z&amp;dl=0 Jordan’s prep memo reveals his plan to accuse Kanter of being an incompetent who keeps failing in his expensive bids to hold corporate power to account, and being an all-powerful government goon who’s got a boot on the chest of American industry. Stoller and Hepner invoke the old Yiddish joke: “The food at this restaurant is terrible, and the portions are too small!” Stoller and Hepner close by wondering what to make of this factional split in the American right. Is it that these members of the GOP Congressional caucus just haven’t gotten the memo? Or is this a peek at what corporate lobbyists home to accomplish after the 2024 elections? They suggest that both Democrats and Republican primary contesters in that race could do well by embracing antitrust, “Establishment Republicans want you to pay more for groceries, healthcare, and travel, and are perfectly fine letting monopoly corporations make decisions about your daily life.” I don’t know if Republicans will take them up on it. The party’s most important donors are pathologically loss-averse and unwilling to budge on even the smallest compromise. Even a faint whiff of state action against unlimited corporate power can provoke a blitz of frenzied scare-ads. In New York state, a proposal to ban noncompetes has triggered a seven-figure ad-buy from the state’s Business Council: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/noncompete-campaign-raises-state-lobbying-18442769.php It’s hard to overstate how unhinged these ads are. Writing for The American Prospect, Terri Gerstein describes one: “a hammer smashes first an alarm clock, then a light bulb, with shards of glass flying everywhere. An ominous voice predicts imminent doom. Then, for good measure, a second alarm clock is shattered”: https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-10-business-groups-reflexive-anti-worker-demagogy/ Banning noncompetes is good for workers, but it’s also unambiguously good for business and the economy. They “reduce new firm entry, innovation by startups, and the ability of new firms to grow.” 44% of small business owners report having been blocked from starting a new company because of a noncompete; 35% have been blocked from hiring the right person for a vacancy due to a noncompete. : https://eig.org/noncompetes-research-brief/ As Gerstein writes, it’s not unusual for the business lobby to lobby against things that are good for business — and lobby hard. The Chamber of Commerce has gone Hulk-mode on simple proposals to adapt workplaces for rising temperatures, acting as though permitting “rest, shade, water, and gradual acclimatization” on the jobsite will bring business to a halt. But actual businesses who’ve implemented these measures describe them as an easy lift that increases productivity. The Chamber lobbies against things its members support — like paid sick days. The Chamber complains endlessly about the “patchwork” of state sick leave rules — but scuttles any attempt to harmonize these rules nationally, even though members who’ve implemented them call them “no big deal”: https://cepr.net/report/no-big-deal-the-impact-of-new-york-city-s-paid-sick-days-law-on-employers/ The Chamber’s fight against American businesses is another one of those fracture lines in the conservative coalition. Working with far right dark money groups, they’ve worked in statehouses nationwide to roll back child labor laws: https://www.epi.org/blog/florida-legislature-proposes-dangerous-roll-back-of-child-labor-protections-at-least-16-states-have-introduced-bills-putting-children-at-risk/ They also fight tooth-and-nail against minimum wage rises, despite 80% of their members supporting them: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/04/leaked-documents-show-strong-business-support-for-raising-the-minimum-wage/ The spectacle of Republicans in disarray is fascinating to watch and even a little exciting, giving me hope for real progressive gains. Of course, it would help if the Democratic coalition wasn’t such a mess.

While we know that when very massive stars die, their cores collapse and that can lead to the formation of black holes, we know there must be other ways to form them: It may even be possible, although there are some compelling physics reasons to think not, that the Universe was born with primordial black holes: a population of black holes that sprang into existence long before the very first stars ever formed. These scenarios are particularly important when it comes to explaining the existence of the earliest supermassive black holes ever seen, as many of them are what we call “overmassive” or “outsized,” where it’s very difficult to explain how they got so massive, so quickly, especially considering the environments they’re in. With the newest cosmic record breaker — black hole UHZ1, the most distant ever discovered — the cosmic mystery just deepened in an unexpected way. Here’s why scientists are fascinated. Starting in the late 1950s, we began observing energetic sources in the Universe that didn’t match any known class of object. As we moved beyond optical astronomy and started exploring the Universe in other wavelengths, new types of objects began to emerge. With the advent of radio astronomy, certain sources appeared to emit large amounts of radiation with either no visible-light counterpart or simply a single, unresolvable point of light. These… "

We’ll be using an AI generator that barely anyone ever talks about it. And I’m pretty sure this story is going to leave your jaws dropped. Now, most of the side hustles I share are very simple, in terms of the structure and steps you need to follow. If you can use the tips I share to focus on a specific keyword in a smaller market, you’ll make money for sure. How many of us are fashionistas or love a good fabric pattern? Well what if I told you it was possible to start out your own fashion line with almost no effort. Yeah, I’m serious. And no, I’m not writing this story just for the fashionistas, there’s room for everyone with this side hustle. The best part is that I’ll be sharing highly popular online platforms, where you can sell these patterns to generate a steady stream of passive income. Now remember, the images we’re talking about are patterns So, we’ll be generating these patterns to sell online using AI art generatorsm And for this, allow me to introduce Creative Fabrica Spark. First, we need the ideas or niches. Simply head over to ChatGPT and ask for pattern ideas that can be generated with AI. Now, these are quite broad niche ideas, so let’s narrow them down a bit. Ask ChatGPT to give you 10–20 sub niches for your favorite category. Now that we have the ideas we need, let’s head over to Creative Fabrica Spark. So Creative Fabrica Spark is a suite of AI tools but we’re particularly interested in its pattern generator. So once you choose the pattern generator, it’s time to start generating. You can copy-paste this simple prompt & replace it with your specific idea to generate the pattern of your choice. Now, Here’s the pattern I generated with Creative Fabrica Spark using this same prompt. I don’t know about you but this pattern is pretty amazing. Now, With the ideas from ChatGPT and a tool like creative Fabrica Spark, you’ll be able to generate endless images and patterns to sell online. This has to be the most important part of this story, so pay attention. You guys loved Zazzle the last time I talked about it. So here’s another idea for you. At least this time, AI is doing almost everything for you. Now, Zazzle gets over 24.2 million visitors per month. On Zazzle, you just need to upload a digital copy of your pattern on products like Zazzle will then handle the entire shipping costs and customer service while you make passive income. Creating a Zazzle shop is free, and I found a seller who was making a pretty sustainable income of over $7,000 per month. This is another lesser known print on demand website, which means less competition and more sales for you. Don’t be deceived, Society 6 gets over 3.3 Million visitors every month and works just like Zazzle. Moreso, I found a seller who made $7,091 selling patterns on Society 6. Sounds familiar right? Creative Fabrica, Creative Fabrica Spark! Yeah, they’re the same website. So you can basically create and sell patterns on the same marketplace. The only difference is that you won’t be selling your pattern as a physical product but instead as a digital product that can either be In fact in my creative Fabrica shop, I sell AI generated patterns as bundles alongside my Canva templates. AI is getting better and better everyday. Before now, it would have taken a super skilled designer to make a pattern like what we generated. Now, with just a simple prompt, AI does it all. But wait! I got way too excited about this new found side hustle, that I almost forgot to mention something important. Well, I couldn’t also justify spending $19 on the subscription for this side hustle.

That warm, comforting blanket we wrap ourselves in, especially when the world feels cold and alienating. It’s like the aged scotch in Grandpa’s hidden flask — smooth, intoxicating, and steeped in history. Yet sometimes, that very same culture can act like the jagged rocks you didn’t see as you swam in the sea of life, cutting you when you least expect it. One of those sharp rocks, ladies and gentlemen, is misogyny dressed up as “traditional values.” When we hear phrases like “traditional values,” it’s easy to conjure images of simpler times, where people had roles, knew their places, and everything was supposedly “right” with the world. Ah, yes — the good ol’ days, where we imagine that everyone lived in harmony, unaware that harmony often came at a steep price. What some folks don’t seem to understand — or choose not to — is that this so-called simplicity often masked blatant inequities. You see, there’s a glaring issue when we let culture justify outdated practices, particularly those that discriminate based on gender. Think about the cousin who justifies asking his sister to serve drinks at a family gathering because “that’s how it’s always been done.” Or the executive who smirks when women at the office can’t get a promotion because the male-dominated higher-ups claim it’s “not our culture” to let women lead. See, the thing is, hiding behind tradition can become an all-too-convenient excuse for some pretty ugly behavior. I’ve heard the argument more times than I can count: “Oh, it’s not that we’re against women having rights, but our culture has a different view of gender roles.” Let’s get one thing straight: It’s 2023, and invoking culture should not be a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a misogynist. But why is the “culture” card so effective? Simple — it taps into our emotional centers. It evokes nostalgia and the comfort of belonging, which… "

It’s like avocados at brunch — everyone’s got an opinion on it, and it somehow always ends up costing more than you expected. So, let’s embark on this joyride through the lens of none other than Andrew Tate, the self-proclaimed guru of manliness. Buckle up; it’s going to be a ride filled with more twists and turns than a season of Game of Thrones. Let’s start with a little story, shall we? Picture this: you’re at a bar, the music is pumping, and in walks a guy who looks like he bench-presses Twitter trolls for breakfast. Yep, that’s our guy, Andrew Tate. Now, according to Tate’s handbook, the first step to being a ‘real man’ is to have the confidence of a peacock on steroids. You know, the kind that makes Kanye West look modest. But hold your horses, it’s not just about confidence. No, no. It’s about having that air of ‘I know better than you because I am a man, hear me roar’. It’s like those old spice commercials on some questionable substances. Moving on to the next chapter in the Tate manifesto: Muscles and Money. Because, obviously, the worth of a man is directly proportional to the circumference of his biceps and the weight of his wallet. It’s like saying the quality of a pizza depends on how circular it is — somewhat true, but mostly just sad. And don’t forget, you’re not just working out for health. Oh no, you’re doing it so that you can post a gym selfie with a caption that’s deep enough to rival a fortune cookie. Something like, “In the gym, lifting weights, because life has already put enough weight on my shoulders.” Deep, right? Ah, we’ve now reached the crux of the Tate philosophy: mansplaining. It’s an art form, really. The key is to explain things to people (preferably women) with the condescending assumption that they have the understanding of a spoon.

For me, it’s not even a room, but a piece of furniture — Mom’s China cabinet. It sits there, elegantly in the corner of the living room, like a sentry of ceramic and glass, guarding my family’s history, fragility, and a considerable amount of guilt. Ah yes, guilt — that heavy emotion, so powerful it might as well be another dish in that cabinet. As I traverse the years, it’s surprising how many memories seem to take up residence in that cabinet. It’s like a Pandora’s box; opening it might unleash all the forgotten family tales and incidents we all subtly choose to ignore. But why? Why does no one touch Mom’s China cabinet? It’s not like it has some ancient curse or would collapse if I dared to get a plate from it. But there it is — an unspoken family rule, as firm as the ground we walk on. The China stays in the cabinet; the cabinet stays closed. End of story. It’s interesting to think about the stories that lurk behind that glass door. You see, the China isn’t just any dinnerware; it’s a familial heirloom, passed down through generations. Each plate is more than a dish; it’s a canvas imprinted with history. Perhaps, it’s this weight of history that makes it so sacred and untouchable. Each dish is like a page from a family diary, depicting events, maybe even secrets, we’re not prepared to face. For instance, there’s this one particular cup and saucer set — the pattern on it looks like a swirl of pastel skies and soft clouds. It was grandma’s favorite. I remember her sipping her chamomile tea from it, telling me tales of her own youth that felt like fables from a time too distant to be real. And now, it just sits there, untouched, like a bookmark in a novel that no one dares to open anymore. It’s not just about what’s inside the cabinet, though. It’s also about the… "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

There is no point engaging with these chuds, because all they want to do is waste my time and/or drag me and anyone else they can into an argument. (At some point, I began telling people, “What you’re trying to do takes two people. I’m not going to be one of them.” It’s been surprisingly effective.) But a couple days ago, someone wasn’t a dick about it, and I took the opportunity to say what’s been on my mind about the whole stupid issue. I’m posting it here so I can refer to it when necessary (which I hope isn’t often). Despite what you have heard, if you look past the headlines you’ll discover that Covid is very much still A Thing, and so is the flu, the common cold, and other respiratory illnesses. I started masking during the pandemic, because I didn’t want to get sick and die. I have kept masking when I’m in close proximity to other people, large crowds, or small indoor spaces because I haven’t had the flu or a cold or, gods forbid, Covid, since I made that choice. I have this particular strain of Epstein Barre in my body that makes every infection I get significantly worse than it would be on its own. It’s technically an autoimmune condition, and though it hasn’t made anything life threatening, it’s made me real miserable when I have gotten sick. And now I have a really simple way to minimize my risks, while I continue to enjoy sporting events, concerts, conventions, and all the things I didn’t realize I took for granted until Covid. It’s such a tiny, simple, thing and it makes a huge difference for me. It reduces my anxiety, and it just makes my quality of life better. And that shouldn’t matter, but getting all worked up about it is like getting all worked up about my glasses, which I wear so I can see clearly and enjoy my life. It really shouldn’t be any different. It’s too bad that so many people have decided to make yet another personal health choice that is none of their business, that doesn’t affect them at all, just another part of their culture war. And it tells you everything you need to know about a person when they are a dick about it. From a practical standpoint: I took this picture at the Flyers game. The guy next to me was coughing and sneezing his face off the whole game. It would have been so awesome and considerate if he’d worn a mask to protect all of us from whatever he had. But he didn’t. Whether it was just allergies, or a cold, or something more serious, with minimal effort and no disruption to him, I protected myself from someone who wasn’t protecting me. That’s basically why I wear a mask whenever I’m in a crowd, and why I wish it wasn’t such a big stupid deal (pro or against). I see a lot of thank yous for wearing masks in our photos. I appreciate the kindness, but we aren’t making a statement. We aren’t modeling behavior. We are doing what is best for us, period. This isn’t a statement, it’s just a personal health choice. If it helps normalize the entire thing, I’m happy for that passive bonus, but it’s not something I’m spending an action or even a bonus action on. I haven’t heard someone complain that I wear shoes into a restaurant, and I haven’t ever had someone thank me for wearing shoes in a restaurant. I hope it will be the same with masks, sooner than later. It’s nobody’s business, and the only people who are dicks about it are dicks about everything else, anyway. (There is a 100% chance that someone will show up here to be a dick about this. They can’t help it.) I’m just tired of this being not just A Thing, but A Big Stupid Fucking Culture War Thing. So. Mind your business, do what’s best for your health and in consideration of the health of those around you, and don’t be a dick. Thanks for listening. "

It’s endless follow-ups. It’s 40 trips to the gynecologist in three years to find out it’s “just menopause.” It’s getting your period after a year and a half the morning you put on white leggings to go on a 5-hour group hike. It’s well since you got your period you need another sonogram/biopsy, and follow-up. Also, your cholesterol is high, your sugar is high, and your blood pressure is very low — are you even alive?

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

One of these words doesn’t belong on the list below. Can you guess which one? If you said, “Fryingpan,” then congratulations! You are right! Fryingpan is the ONLY ONE of the words on this list that appears in the Bible. In fact, the word fryingpan appears twice — in Leviticus 2:7 and Leviticus 7:9. As for the rest of this list: Not in the Bible — not even once. I often chuckle at Christians who leave comments on my articles saying things like, “The Bible says this or that,” or “The Bible is clear about this or that.” That’s because many of these Bible enthusiasts haven’t actually flipped through the pages themselves. Their knowledge of the Bible has come from what others have told them. You see, there are a whole lot of events, words, and sayings that people commonly attribute to the Bible, that are actually nowhere to be found between the leather-bound covers of God’s holy word. Don’t believe me? Here are a few examples: You’re a good Christian, so you know the Christmas story inside and out, right? You know that when Mary and Joseph rocked up in Bethlehem with Mary bursting at the seams in late-term pregnancy, they knocked on the door of some local inn and begged the innkeeper for a room. Alas, there was no room in the inn for poor Mary and Joseph, but the kind innkeeper allowed them to use his stable out the back. Except, there is no inn. And there is no innkeeper. Come to mention it, there is no stable, either. That’s right. The Bible doesn’t mention an inn in the Christmas narrative.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/air-conditioning-parts-and-supplies-f829ef6a5699?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"For homeowners that want to do their own repairs and maintenance finding air conditioning parts and supplies can be a challenge. There are several options that range from working directly with the manufacturer or the retailer to obtain the necessary parts to ordering online or through repair service companies. Air conditioning parts, like automotive parts, are not all interchangeable, which can make purchasing items a bit challenging at times. There are some parts that can be used on multiple types of brands or models, however many of the parts are unique to one particular type of unit. In addition different sizes of units will needed different parts including even universal items like hoses, clamps and fans. Purchasing and installing the wrong parts may cause more damage to the unit when you turn it on and can also create a hazard if the Freon or coolant is released into the air. Whether you are purchasing the air conditioning parts in person at a repair shop or over the internet there are some basic pieces of information you will need. The first is the model and brand name of the air conditioning unit that is undergoing repair. It is important to know the brand to get the right type of part but the model number is also essential. In addition you should know if it is a window mount, through the wall, forced air, high velocity air or portable air conditioning unit. If you are purchasing in person, if at all possible, bring the old or damaged part with you and make a physical comparison. If the part is not identical it may not fit within your unit even it appears to be almost identical. This is particularly true for fan blades and cooling grids or fins that may not fit within the housing or bracket if they are even just a bit different in shape or design. When purchasing air conditioning parts on the internet be aware of exactly what part you are looking for. If possible get the manufacturers part number and use that when ordering. Going to the air conditioner’s manufacturers website can be very helpful in determining the correct name and part number for the item you are replacing. Be sure to check the websites return policy and make sure it is secure website before providing any credit card or personal information. Watch also for the company’s refund policy and if they pay return shipping or if shipping and handling or restocking fees are deducted from your refund.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/how-to-clean-your-air-conditioning-filter-c51766ab47da?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"The air conditioning filter is important in preventing build up of dust, grease and other small particles within the air conditioning unit itself. Without the filter all the dust and debris that are trapped by the filter would be deposited directly on the fins, resulting in that space becoming clogged and blocked. Once the air flow is restricted around the cooling area, the system is just not able to produce cold air. In addition without the filter the debris and dust would stick to the fins as they are moist due to the moisture produced in the cooling process, especially in humid climates. This can and will lead to bacteria growth in the system that in turn blows this bacteria back into the air that you are breathing in. Cleaning the window filter on a regular basis not only helps with cooling but also with the efficiency of the system. A good idea is to clean the filter once before turning on the air conditioner in the spring and then again every three to four weeks while the system is being used. If you live in an area where there is lots of fine dust, smokers in the house or pets you may find that cleaning the filter every two weeks is more beneficial. Window air conditioning filters are the easiest to clean and are typically made of either a sturdy foam type material or a fine mesh. The most common and recommended type of filter is made of polypropylene, which is actually electrostatic and will trap small particles. To clean these types of mesh screens simply wash in warm soapy water and rinse well. Always allow the filter to completely dry before putting it back in the unit. Foam filters should be replaced with a new filter that can be made at home from foam sheets bought at a home supply store. A large outdoor conventional air conditioning filter can be cleaned with commercial solutions, however they often are not as effective after they have been cleaned. A better option is to simply remove and replace the large filters every two months of use. Brush the fins of the outside unit that are located behind the filters and remove all debris and dust either by blowing with compressed air or using a shop vacuum. Always keep the area around the outside unit free from long grass, bushes or vines that may obstruct air flow or add debris into the unit or filter.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/ductless-air-conditioning-systems-for-homes-6db5b8cae01b?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"One option for upgrading or adding AC to an already built or constructed home is to use a type of system called ductless air conditioning. Ductless systems are usually more commonly known as mini-split systems are often used in homes that don’t currently have a forced air heat system that can piggyback the air conditioning. Ductless systems are so named because they don’t use the heating ducts that the traditional forced air furnace system provides. Since there are few homes now built that don’t have forced air heating, there is limited demand for this type of ventilation system. Ductless units are more commonly used in very old houses or in houses in warm climates that don’t have an existing furnace and duct work system. The ductless air conditioning systems work similar to any other type of air conditioner with a unit on the inside that cools the air and a unit on the outside that vents the heat and moisture produced when the air cools. The two units are connected through the walls by tubes, one which carries the electricity to the outside unit and one that carries the water or condensate moisture away from the cooling unit to the outside. Like a traditional forced air system the ductless system works on a thermostat that is mounted in the room or area where the air conditioning unit is located. This system can be used to cool a large or small space, however they have no ability to transfer cool air to other parts of the house so they may not be practical in houses with many different rooms. Open area or open space houses can be effectively cooled by ductless systems provided the appropriately sized air conditioning unit is installed. Purchasing a unit with a high velocity blower or fan can also help with overall uniform temperatures within a larger room or space. The mini-split or ductless air conditioning systems does have several advantages over a window or wall mounted unit. They are a permanent fixture and are typically smaller in size than the wall mounts, plus they don’t need to be removed in the cold weather like the window mount units. The ductless system also doesn’t interfere with security like the window mount units do, which may be a big consideration for people in some areas. The ductless air conditioning system also functions more like a conventional air conditioner than a window or wall mount unit that is either on or off. The mini-split will respond to slight temperature changes and will cycle on and off to maintain the pre-set temperature rather than blasting cold or not running as a wall or window mount unit does.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/adding-air-conditioning-options-to-your-home-a362c2a73d9?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"In most areas, but especially in the southern climates, air conditioning is a definite must. Not only is it essential for general comfort, but in the very southern states it is also a health benefit as temperatures reach into the hundred plus degrees during the long summer months. Air ventilation in these areas is a key factor in resale values of properties and many residences without central air conditioning will be devalued on the market, regardless of the size, condition or architecture of the house. There are two basic types, central air, which means that the cold air is blown through the house from a central cooling unit, typically located outside of the house. There are options within central air conditioning systems including conventional systems, also known as forced air and high velocity air cooling systems. There is some difference in price between these two systems but both are designed to effectively maintain a reasonable temperature in the house. These systems work on thermostats, just like the furnace does in the winter. Air ventilation systems of this type may be coupled with humidity control systems that work to adjust the amount of moisture in the air during the hot summer months. In dry climates additional humidity may be added to the cooled air and in humid climates dehumidifiers are used in conjunction with air conditioning systems to make sure a comfortable room temperature and humidity level. Although either forced air or high velocity air cooling systems are the most expensive to install and maintain, they also add the most value to your home or residence. Another option for cooling your home is to use window units. These are small, semi-portable systems that are installed in the bottom section of a window and draw air through the system cooling the temperature and blowing it into the room. The condensation is drained outside from the back of the unit as is the heat vented out of the room. These small window type air conditioning units are effective for small rooms but typically are not powerful enough to maintain a consistent temperature in a larger room or throughout more than one room. For older homes or homes that currently don’t have the duct work and space needed to install a conventional or whole house air conditioner, these window units may be all that is needed. Since they are not a permanent fixture in the house they may or may not be included in the sale, however they also don’t add any value to the house.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/a-guide-to-water-pollution-65d701b4eb4b?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"Water pollution is any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water that has a harmful effect on any living thing, such as animals or people who either drink the water, uses the water or lives in the water. Contamination of the water supply is responsible for many serious illnesses and can cause harmful effects when it is consumed. Everyone who uses water has a responsibility to make sure that they do their part to prevent water pollution and protect the water supply so that it can be used the way it is intended to be used. Water Pollution occurs when wastes and foreign matters end up in the water. It’s generally caused by many different sources such as sewage and wastes, industrial wastes, oil pollution, marine dumping, radioactive wastes, underground storage leaks, global warming, atmospheric deposition and eutrophication. Pollution of our water can come from many different sources including surface pollution, groundwater, microbiological, chemicals, oxygen depleting and suspended matter. Most types of water pollution only affect the area directly around the pollutant. A larger pollutant, such as an oil spill, affects a broader area and causes a lot more water pollution. Pollution is very dangerous to humans, animals and marine life. Some of the effects of water pollution may not be evident for many years. Industrial wastes can be particularly harmful to the water and the environment as they contain heavy metals that are toxic to fish and shellfish and humans when they eat those same fish and shellfish. When an abundance of organic matter is dumped in to the water systems it causes a depletion of oxygen which results in fish and other aquatic creatures to suffocate. Environmental damage to our water can also take a big toll on the economy because it is very expensive to treat and prevent contamination from water pollution. Wastes spread quickly through out the water supply and into the ocean. By using biological filter, chemical additives and sand filters as water treatments the damage can be prevented. It is much cheaper to prevent water pollution from happening than to have to clean up after the pollution has already occurred, especially if a large area has been contaminated. The cost not only to humans but also to wild life and marine animals is huge when a water source is polluted. Some ways that pollution can be prevented is by being careful about what is thrown down the sink and toilet and conserving water by turning the faucet off when not in use. It is also a good idea to use more environmentally friendly household and cleaning products to reduce the amount of chemical that are being dispensed into the groundwater and to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers.

By writing informative articles on water pollution it helps to educate the public as to the causes of water pollution as well as the damage that pollution creates. Water pollution is a very serious problem. When the water supplies become polluted or contaminated with foreign matters and toxic chemicals and substances it affects not only humans, but animals, fish and aquatic organisms as well. There are articles on water pollution that tell about how the large farms and feedlots significantly contribute to the water pollution problem by dumping an excessively high amount of contaminants in to the water. These feed lots raise hundred of thousands of animals such as chickens, pigs or cows that produce a huge amount of waste. Much of the wastes from these animals runs off into the water supply during the rainy season. Toxins such as artificial growth hormones and antibiotic residue can also be present in the feces and excrement of these animals and these also make their way into the water supply. The manure from farm animals also contains a high amount of nitrates and phosphorus which causes further destruction in the waterways. When high levels of nitrates are found in the drinking water it can cause a condition known as blue baby syndrome which can lead to the death of infants. Articles on water pollution that highlight these issues help to bring about changes to improve the way that feed lots are maintained, and they also help to educate the public on potential problems related to these large farms. Articles on water pollution can also bring about new legislation to help change the laws in regards to water pollution and impose stricter fines for those who are caught polluting the water supplies. It has been said that they pen is mightier than the sword. Persuasive articles on water pollution can go a long way in changing the way that the general public perceives water pollution and help to enact better laws by changing public opinions. In addition, there are many articles on water pollution that highlight the specific damage that is done by a wide variety of contaminants. There are also articles on water pollution that show where the majority of pollution is coming from and tell practical and effective ways to combat water pollution and prevent additional sources of water from being polluted. By being informed as to the sources of water pollution in addition to the devastating effects, much can be done to help get the waterways cleared up and safe from pollution.

One important thing to do is to make sure that toxic products such as paints, oil, gasoline, polishes, cleaning products ad household products are properly disposed of. Never wash these types of substances down the drain or flush them down the toilet. These chemicals should never be washed down a driveway with a hose either to prevent them from getting into the water supply. Other important ways to prevent water pollution is to dispose of trash properly. Make sure that trash is not left in the water gutters or storm sewers around the streets. Never flush items such as feminine products or baby diapers down a toilet. This is not only dangerous to your own personal septic system but also interferes with the sewage treatment facility that handles the water wastes. Never throw litter or trash into lakes, streams, ponds, oceans or rivers and if you see any trash in the waters pick them up and dispose of them properly. Another one of the important ways to prevent water pollution is to use environmentally friendly household products such as shampoos, detergents, and toiletries. Also natural fertilizers have a much less harmful effect on the environment and do not contribute to water pollution the way that traditional commercial fertilizers do. Plant ground cover to reduce the amount of topsoil erosion which also plays a factor in water pollution. One of the more obvious but often overlooked ways to prevent water pollution is to simply use less water. By reducing the amount of water used you will be reducing the amount of water that flows in to the sewage treatment systems. This will help the sewage treatment centers to run more effectively and help to prevent water shortages. There are many more ways to prevent water pollution than have been outlined here. By taking an active role in the health of the water that is so necessary to everyday life, water pollution can become a thing of the past. Helping to prevent water pollution is easier than you think. In order to prevent water pollution, people need to understand the problem and become a part of the solution. Originally published at www.controllingpollution.com on October 20, 2008. "
https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/water-pollution-articles-and-public-opinion-e09f5d4c4820?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"Water pollution has become increasingly troubling in the last few decades. Even though many new laws have been enacted to try to protect the water sources there is still much work to be done to keep the water systems of the world clean and pollution free. One way that we can use to spread information about the problems regarding pollution in our water is by writing water pollution articles. Article content creation can be a very helpful way to get out information about the causes of water pollution as well as the devastating affects of it. When we distribute articles and content to the general public it raises the awareness of the problem which can help in changing public opinion. If no one knows that the contamination of our water is a problem, or even that it’s our problem, then nothing can be done to fix it. By writing informative and well written water pollution articles a lot of good can be done for the environment. Some articles highlight the sources of water pollution, and how much pollution is dumped into the rivers, lakes, and streams as a result of poor farming practices and poor industrial management. There are not enough checks and balances and many industries are slipping below the radar in regards to waste removal. Water pollution articles that are written to expose the sources of much of the pollution can cause a public outcry and result in a change of policy. Articles documenting pollution in water can also tell of the damage that is done by contaminants being dumped into the water. In India millions of children have died as a result of drinking contaminated water. The polluted waters cause diarrhea which leads to dehydration and eventually causes death. Polluted waters are also breeding grounds for vermin and mosquitoes which carry diseases and cause serious sicknesses. Some waters have an unhealthy level of nitrates in them as a result of large farms and feed lots. Waters that have high levels of nitrates are very dangerous to humans and have been known to cause blue baby syndrome which causes the death of infants. Articles that address the ‘how to end pollution’ topic are especially beneficial. These articles help people make better decisions about how to use the water they have to prevent further pollution. These types of water pollution articles also give practical advice on how to properly dispose of potential pollutants to make sure that they don’t end up in the rivers, lakes and streams. Promotion of environmental contamination articles, especially about our water system are imperative to ending the problem of our water contamination and helping to educate the public about the crisis, so that new laws can be made to better protect the waters for the future.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/the-causes-of-water-and-soil-pollution-d596da657d09?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"Water pollution is a growing problem in the world that affects everyone. All forms of life on the planet rely on water for their very existence. Without water nothing could live. Unfortunately many sources of water have been affected by pollution from a wide variety of sources. Water and soil pollution cause many problems to the health of the planet, it’s environment and its inhabitants. It has been estimated that over 40% of the rivers, lakes and streams in the United States of America are too polluted to swim in or fish in. When pollution of the water and soil spreads it can cause serious consequences. One very big cause of water and soil pollution is large farms and feed lots. These facilities raise hundreds of thousands of pigs, cows or chickens is a relatively small amount of space. The resulting sludge and manure that is emitted from these animals creates a mountain of toxic waste. Animal manure is known to be high in nitrates. Most large feed lots also treat their animals with artificial growth hormones and antibiotics which are then also emitted into the soil and run off into the water supply. This results in a very contaminated area that causes major pollution. Another problem with these large feed lots is the amount of soil erosion that takes place as a result of not having any ground cover. The animals are typically housed in a slew of mud and manure. With no ground cover to hold down the soil the rain washes all the contaminants right into the nearby water systems along with a lot of mud and sludge that further pollutes the water and causes a murky appearance. When water becomes too murky the sunlight can not reach the plants on the bottom of the rivers and streams and they eventually die. When this happens there is a decrease in oxygen in the water which causes more plants to die. It is a viscous cycle that results in the death of many plants, animals and aquatic organisms. One way that water and soil pollution can be prevented is by growing a buffer zone around farms and water ways. A buffer zone would act as a filter of sorts to filter out a lot of the sludge and chemicals that are drained into the water from the large feed lots. By growing a wide variety of ground cover as well it will prevent the depletion and erosion of the soil which will further protect the waterways from becoming polluted. Taking steps now to prevent water and soil pollution will help protect not only the water sources in the future, but the soil from being contaminated.

https://medium.com/@controllingpollution/the-two-types-of-water-pollution-6c15a87568b5?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"Water pollution has become a very serious problem in recent years. Water pollution is caused when pollutants spill into a body of water and cause adverse affects on the wildlife and drinking potential. There are two different types of water pollution as sources. These sources are listed as point sources of pollution and nonpoint sources of water pollution. A nonpoint source of polluted water comes from runoff diverting pollutants directly into a source of water such as pesticides or fertilizers being washed into a storm gutter and then being carried away into nearby streams and rivers. A point source of pollution happens when a sewer pipe leaks toxic substances into a river. There are many water pollution types. Toxic substances are caused by chemical pollutants being emitted into the water through sources such as herbicides, pesticides and industrial compounds. Organic pollution is another one that effects the water systems. Organic pollution is caused by manure or sewage. Most organic pollutants come from large feed lots and major farming practices that produce an extremely large amount of wastes. When organic matter overwhelms a body of water it causes the oxygen to deplete which kills fish and plants. High levels of nitrogen and phosphates also cause the decrease in oxygen in the water and create dead zones where algae grows in an abundance killing plants and fish. Thermal pollution is one of the types of water pollution that occurs when water is used as a coolant near a power plant or industrial facility. The water is heated up and then returned at a higher degree than it was when it was taken out. This causes a decrease in oxygen levels which affects the plants and marine life. There is also ecological pollution that unlike chemical pollution, organic pollution and thermal pollution, is one type that is caused by nature. Ecological pollution is caused from landslides, dead animals drowning in the water supply, and volcanic eruptions. The different water pollution types come from many different sources such as farms that use large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers which cause the increase of nitrates and phosphates in the water. Run off from nearby farms also causes water to become cloudy which blocks the sunlight from reaching the plants along the bottom of the water system. When the plants do not receive enough sunlight they die which further stresses the water systems by reducing the amount of oxygen in the water. Some other types of water pollution come from businesses and homes. Originally published at www.controllingpollution.com on October 12, 2008. "
https://medium.com/@sergiospatterson/running-in-an-urban-world-a-runners-guide-to-avoiding-pollution-2147bbea49b9?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Aside from safety concerns runners who dwell in tightly packed urban areas have to deal with pollution. It would be counter-productive to continue on running while developing major lung problems. Though pollution in a large city is unavoidable, a runner can take these three simple steps to minimize the harmful effects of pollution. Running On Off Peak Hours To save yourself from the nasty emissions of combustion based vehicles it is best to try and avoid them totally. Running during hours of least traffic will ensure that you will get the least polluted air possible. If you beloved this article so you would like to be given more info with regards to anti pollution mask i implore you to visit the page. Different roads have different peak hours. So make sure you try and find out which times are least to have vehicles in your route. This may mean that you will have to wake up earlier or start out later than most people’s morning run. Avoiding Highly Polluted Routes This may be simple statement but avoiding areas that usually have traffic jams is good for minimizing your inhaled toxins. Road junctions, convenience store locations or roads leading to large interstates are best left to vehicles only. Urban dwelling might also be close to industrial factories. It is best to avoid them especially at mornings when dirty chemical ridden air comes down. Sewerage substations are also places you should avoid since they are a source of nasty bacteria that can give you lung infections. The ideal places to run on in an urbanized setting are those back alleys or purely residential areas. Running here can mean fewer distractions and fewer vehicles that are the source of stuff that may mess up your lungs. Wearing a Mask Wearing masks may be a bit weird. But if you visit some countries like China or Japan it seems to be a common sight. With the height of airborne virus threats like swine flu, wearing a mask will not only prevent you from inhaling lead but also keep you safe from other people’s germs. If you cannot stand the thought of being Darth Vader of the streets at least bring a handkerchief or a small towel to cover your nose with. Inhaling the deadly smoke from cars could be as worse to your health as smoking. A runner can minimize exposure to pollution while running in an urbanized placed if he follows these three simple steps. It may require a lot of tweaking in your running schedule and route but if you value your health you will want to avoid inhaling polluted gases as much as possible. You may also find it difficult to wear a mask or cover your nose. This little inconvenience will greatly decrease the amount of pollution your body takes in. "
https://medium.com/@sergiospatterson/defences-against-pollution-dbceba69604e?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"In the 4th century before Christ, Emperor Ashoka issued edicts engraved in stones, ordering the protection of human health and the life of animals and plants. The fight against pollution has been on since time immemorial. But the magnitude of the problem was less alarming in the earlier days and so the solutions were also less sophisticated. The world today has reached a point where we cannot put the clock back or resign ourselves to a simplistic natural state. Technology is. here to stay. Industrialisation is a part of the struggle being waged by man to make the world a better place for him to live in. Keeping in mind the maxim, ‘environment with development’ we may proceed to seek the defences against pollution. In order to minimise the effects of industrial pollution, four distinct procedures arc to be put into effect. The thrust of the anti-pollution campaign should be to force the industries to adopt modern scientific techniques to bring down to the minimum the toxicity of industrial wastes. For this purpose legal compulsions coupled with restrictions are to be resorted to. A national service backed by legislative Acts for monitoring pollution levels in various ecospheres has already started functioning with success in some of the developed nations. A third measure would be to entrap the hazardous discharges or the smoke from the factories and neutralise them by catalytic filters and absorbers, If viable, accessory plants may also be set up to convert the toxic by-products into substances of utility value. Finally, proper safety measures are to be ensured. If the management fails to do so, statutory provisions may be invoked to compel them to fall in line. Solutions to the problem of air pollution are also offered in the forms of afforestation and mass realisation of the menace of the multi-faceted problem of air pollution. Nature has provided us with a solution to the problem of oxygen deficiency in the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis of plants. Hence planting of trees is one sure and simple remedy to air pollution. But the remedy is to become a movement for a definite and widespread impact. After air, soil and water are the two major affected areas of the biosphere. Mining and quarrying for minerals, felling of trees for timber arid fuel wood, clearing of forest areas for agriculture degrade the soil. But then, these activities are essential for progress and development. Area management is the solution in this case While trees are being axed down in one part, a regular force should be working for afforestation in another corner. Another common cause of soil degradation is ill-managed irrigation which often results in severe salinity and water-logging. Overdose of pesticides is becoming another menace in agricultural sector. The affected areas have little chance of revival. But a defence against this terror lies in the timely interference of scientists. Proper outlets and avoidance of haphazard town planning will provide a relief from water- logging. It is, thus, obvious that the various aspects of pollution are interlinked and tackling of one will consequently lead to an improved condition of the other. Protection of the environment still remains by and large a little understood subject. For those who have almost any queries with regards to where as well as how you can utilize bike mask, you are able to e-mail us at the web-page. Most people are not aware of the fact that it is not mere protection of a few animal or plant species, or planting of trees, or the concern over big polluting industries, or the simple cleaning up of the environment that constitutes environmental protection. It is a combination of all these. The knowledge of environment and environmental pollution can no more be the subject of specialists only. Time has come for the introduction of environmental study as a regular subject in schools. The school project work of students should include at least one programme to fight the evil effects of pollution. This will lead to awareness for the preservation of nature which has to touch the heart of every common man. This awareness will be our greatest defence against pollution. "

President Joe Biden was in Idaho and California on Monday to tour communities ravaged by this season’s wildfires. “We can’t ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,” he said. Some 5.6 million acres have burned so far this year. The big fires in California, which have dominated the news, finally appear to be slowing down because they are simply running out of room. The eastern arm of the Dixie Fire is sandwiched between the Beckworth Complex (which burned earlier this year) and 2019’s Walker Fire, where there’s a lot less fuel to burn. That is allowing crews to focus efforts elsewhere. After weeks of fire departments sending every available worker to Northern California, you can now see fire engines heading down from the mountains, back to Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Rain has also helped to cool the blazes. It arrived with lightning, however, which set new fires in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains. Hello! It’s Zoya. This summer, thick plumes of smoke from wildfires burning in the western U.S. drifted across the country, prompting local officials as far east as Portland, Maine, to issue air-quality warnings. Studies have shown that these kinds of smoky days have deleterious effects on the human respiratory system. Wildfire smoke carries particulate matter that can bury itself deep in the lungs. Those tiny particles can aggravate heart and lung diseases and even lead to premature death. But scientists still know remarkably little about what other harmful elements wildfire smoke might carry. “The potential for human pathogens to be spread in wildfire smoke has been ignored by those working on the health impacts of wildfire smoke,” Jason Smith, a professor of forest pathology at the University of Florida, told me recently. I had called him up to talk about a disease called Valley fever, which is caused by a fungus that lives in the soil of the desert Southwest and western U.S. Cases of the disease, which develops in people who breathe in the fungus spores, are on the rise: The number of people diagnosed has increased by 32 percent nationwide in recent years. One study determined that cases in California rose 800 percent between 2000 and 2018. And for the roughly 40 percent of people who develop symptoms, the infection can be quite serious. That’s what happened to Jesse Merrick, a sportscaster and former football player. Merrick thinks he got Valley fever after helping his mom clear out the wreckage of his childhood home after it burned down in 2017’s Thomas Fire. A few weeks after he returned home to Alabama, Jesse started coughing and running a low-grade fever. A rash appeared on his upper torso. “I remember being miserable,” he said. “I wasn’t sleeping.” Once the rash started to move up his neck, about four days after he first started feeling sick, Jesse knew he had to get to an urgent-care clinic. It would be three more agonizing weeks before an infectious disease specialist finally diagnosed him with Valley fever, which is caused by the fungus Coccidioides. Scientists aren’t exactly sure what environmental factors drive Cocci transmission. A pattern of intense rainfall and severe drought, some researchers speculate, could be behind the recent explosion of cases. But experts are still puzzling out what, if any, connection wildfires have to Valley fever. Smith, the professor from the University of Florida, is working on a study that will, in part, determine whether Coccidioides can travel in wildfire smoke. His research is still in its early stages, but previous studies he’s worked on have demonstrated that fungal spores can indeed travel far distances on wind and by clinging to the particles in wildfire smoke. “There’s just no reason why Coccidioides would be immune from that,” he said. In this week’s Grist cover story, I dive deep into Valley fever and the reasons why the disease is on the rise in many western states (spoiler alert: climate change plays a role).

Signup to receive The Burning Issue weekly in your inbox, available free for a limited time. It’s Wednesday, September 8, and all the biggest fires are burning in California Good morning, Nate here. There are 81 large fires burning in 11 U.S. states right now. Some 5.1 million acres have burned so far this year, and wildfire suppression costs have reached $3.3 billion. The biggest of the lot, the Dixie Fire, is already one of the largest wildfires in California history, topped only by last year’s August Complex, which burned more than a million acres. But the Dixie Fire is closing in on that record. Some other regions of the country experienced their biggest burns long ago: The Miramichi Fire of 1825 that cut across Maine and into Canada, the Great Michigan Fire of 1871, and The Big Burn of 1910 in the Rocky Mountains. Each consumed millions of acres. Now it’s California’s turn: Nine of the 10 biggest wildfires in the state’s history have occurred in the last decade — six of those since the start of last year. In the drought-stricken West, fires further threaten water supplies Zoya here. Some evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings this week for parts of Lake Tahoe as firefighters managed to contain 49 percent of the Caldor Fire, a blaze that threatened to wipe out towns surrounding North America’s largest alpine lake. But even though Caldor has so far been kept away from South Lake Tahoe, ash from the blaze has reached Lake Tahoe, turning its famed crystal blue waters cloudy. Scientists aren’t yet sure whether the murkiness will encourage more algae blooms or cause other damage, but they know from past experience that wildfire ash, soot, and smoke can have lasting effects on water quality and, by association, public health. In 2018, a faulty transmission line on Camp Creek Road in Northern California’s Butte County ignited the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. The Camp Fire left behind razed towns and charred landscapes and also sent a cocktail of volatile compounds into the town of Paradise’s 172-mile network of underground water pipes. In order to rid its water supply of fire-borne contaminants such as benzene, toluene, and xylene — chemicals linked to adverse health effects in humans — Paradise had to spend millions clearing and replacing its pipes. A recent article by a team of researchers from the American Geophysical Union, or AGU, illuminates the breadth of the wildfire-related water quality crisis across the country. When a fire burns through an area, it leaves a layer of loose ash on the ground. The lightweight ash contains tiny particles called dissolved organic matter, which can linger in burned landscapes for years, even decades. When rains eventually come, as they will later this year in California and other states badly affected by wildfire, that organic matter, called PyDOM, can leach into nearby water sources, creating a host of problems that are expensive and difficult to address. The AGU researchers clocked changes in water coloration and taste following nine major wildfires in California, South Carolina, and Colorado between 2002 and 2020. They noted that PyDOM served as a kind of petri dish for microbial growth in water in burned watersheds. This required cities and towns to pour more treatment chemicals into their water, like chlorine and ferric iron. But the disinfection process creates its own set of problems: Disinfectants can form byproducts with PyDOM, and some of those can be toxic. Chloramination, for example, a process used to disinfect drinking water, can produce N-nitrosodimethylamine — a chemical compound that is a known carcinogen in laboratory animals — when it’s introduced into water that contains PyDOM. Wildfire ash runoff doesn’t just make water treatment more complicated and pricey, it may also create dangerous knock-on effects. Burned biomass, fire retardant, and suppression chemicals such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus can choke aquatic wildlife where they enter rivers and streams and spark algal blooms. Some of those blooms contain algae that create naturally-occurring brain and liver toxins and complicate water treatment. All of these fire-related side effects on the country’s water supply pose problems long after the flames are gone. And, as climate change fuels bigger and more intense fires, the threat to water quality is sure to become an increasingly urgent concern. “As wildfires burn hotter and consume more fuel in future climates, water quality will progressively degrade,” the researchers said. Water utilities, they noted, need to prepare. "

Good morning, Zoya here. There are 83 large fires burning across the U.S. right now. More than a dozen of those are in California, where hot and windy conditions over the weekend helped fuel blazes that are still nowhere near fully contained. The U.S. Forest Service is taking the extraordinary step of closing all national forests in the state due to the threat of wildfire. Right now, all eyes are on the Caldor Fire, which broke out in El Dorado County two weeks ago and has burned some 200,000 acres. On Tuesday, the fire descended into the Lake Tahoe Basin, home to tens of thousands of people and the largest alpine lake in North America. Caldor, which is currently only 16-percent contained, has prompted local officials to issue mandatory evacuations for all of South Lake Tahoe and other affected areas. Elsewhere, a new fire broke out roughly 500 miles south in San Diego County on Saturday, burning nearly 1,500 acres in less than a day. The Chaparral Fire was 50 percent contained on Tuesday evening. The Dixie Fire, which started on July 13 just east of Paradise, is the second-largest wildfire in California state history and is still burning in five counties. It’s less than 50-percent contained. The Boundary Fire in Idaho, which was first detected on August 10, flared up again and has burned close to 5,000 acres. Nearly 6 million acres and 4,000 structures have burned in wildfires so far this year, and the U.S. has spent more than $3 billion on wildfire suppression. And per the National Interagency Fire Center’s request, some 200 U.S. Army soldiers will receive training to assist the more than 27,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel battling blazes in the West. As fire outpaces people, one town actually acted. Hello, Nathanael here! Earlier this year, the town of Grizzly Flats, California, was set to remove brush and small trees from it’s forested outskirts — a project funded by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and intended to help protect a community recognized as “exceptionally isolated and vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire.” But before the work could begin, the Caldor Fire wiped the town off the map. The incident is far from the only example of fires moving faster than our ability to adapt. In many places, it feels as if the wheels of politics grind slow. The community discussions over what should be done to prepare for wildfire can feel intractable. But when I asked around to learn if there was an example of a place breaking through the deadlock and taking dramatic measures, I kept hearing about Ashland, Oregon. Back in the ’90s, the community couldn’t have been more polarized. When the Forest Service proposed removing trees and cutting fire breaks to reduce the city’s fire risk, environmentalists in ski masks showed up to warn that there would be dire consequences if a single tree fell. But over the years, the town, environmentalists, and the Forest Service have achieved near-consensus on what needs to be done — and gotten down to work. When logging trucks full of thinned out trees huffed through downtown Ashland in 2004, liberal locals waved “with all five fingers this time,” one Forest Service lifer told me. Crews removed smaller trees and brush, allowing the town to begin a regime of controlled burning year after year — efforts that have reduced the potential for a fire to rise into Ashland’s tree canopy by 70 percent. The details of how the groups in Ashland made their way from white-hot animosity to mutual respect and trust — including a tradition-bucking female ranger, a man named Bobcat, and environmentalists with chainsaws — are featured in this week’s Grist cover story. As a climate journalist, I feel like there’s an unending stream of warnings and disasters to cover, and precious few solutions. That’s upside down: I don’t need to be convinced there’s a problem, I just need the tools to solve it. And Ashland’s story offers some of those tools. "

Signup to receive The Burning Issue weekly in your inbox, available free for a limited time. Hello and welcome to late August! Nathanael here. There are 77 large uncontained fires burning across the U.S. this week, down from over 100 last week. Firefighting crews shifted resources to California to attend to four blazes over 100,000 acres. Those include the biggest fire in the country, the 700,000-acre Dixie Fire, and the explosive new blaze, the Caldor Fire, which erupted to 115,000 acres in just 9 days, becoming the latest exhibit of “unprecedented fire behavior” this season. Thousands of people have left their homes under mandatory evacuation orders. While the biggest blazes char California, many others are crackling in other parts of the country. A string of fires is burning up the Cascade Mountain Range through Oregon and Washington, nearing 650,000 acres in all. Some 800,000 acres are aflame in the Great Basin and Northern Rockies. And it’s not just the West — fires are also burning in Minnesota’s Superior National Forest, shutting down access to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for the first time in nearly half a century. How long could this possibly last? Because I write about climate change and wildfire, and live in California, friends sometimes text or email asking me some variation of the same question: “Is this going to happen every year now?” They are asking about the grubby skies, the life-shortening grit in their sinuses, the cancelled outdoor plans, and the annual dose of fear that fire will consume their family, or their home. They are asking if they should leave California for good. My answer: It all depends on how we humans react to the crisis we’ve created. A recent paper projecting wildfire behavior casts a little light on the problem. Researchers were modeling possible futures for 16,000 acres south of Yosemite, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The study, published in the journal Ecosphere, was especially noteworthy because it didn’t just look at how higher temperatures would affect fire, or how climate change might affect plant growth — but both at the same time: The complex interplay of heat crisping vegetation, drought suppressing growth, and fire consuming fuel. Basically, the model suggested an intense burst of big fires over the coming decade, and then a regime of smaller, cooler fires. The catch is that scientists let the fires in their model burn unimpeded, with no suppression, allowing the blaze to remove fuels from the forest. “Once you scale up to entire regions, a lot of the self-limiting effects of wildfires run out after 10 years of regrowth,” said Maureen Kennedy, one of the scientists behind the study, who is based at the University of Washington, Tacoma. “And so if you go back to suppressing fire again, you’re back where you started.” This particular tract of forest isn’t analogous to the wet forests of the Olympic Peninsula, or the lodgepole pine forests of the Rocky Mountains. But it is a great example of the kind of forests that have recently burned very hot and generated a lot of smoke, like the North Complex Fire near Oroville, and the Creek Fire, which consumed some of the study area. The question is: Are we willing to let blazes burn unimpeded for a decade if it means a less intense fire future? The scientists’ study area was a largely uninhabited swath of national forest. It’s politically difficult to reduce fire suppression even a little bit (see last week’s newsletter, for instance), because Americans tend to assume that firefighters will save every single home and every single tree they can. Fire officials could ease up on suppression in unpopulated forests, while still fighting fires at the edges of communities, but they are often afraid to do anything but extinguish the flames as soon as possible. We are in the middle of a new period where it feels like there are bigger and bigger fires every year. It can be frightening. But if humans are willing to allow the fires to clean up the forests, this chapter might be relatively short. Or as Kennedy said: “What happens next is up to us.” "

Hello and welcome to the first edition of The Burning Issue — Grist’s limited-run newsletter about all things fire. My name is Zoya Teirstein and below, you’ll hear from my colleague Nathanael Johnson. Every week, Grist will send you an email that will arm you with everything you need to know about this wildfire season. We’ve reached a critical point in the 2021 fire year. Spring and early summer are historically rough in the Southwest, where fires rage early and die out as monsoon season arrives later in the summer. That is when fires in the West normally pick up pace, beginning in August and into the fall. “That’s when shit really hits the fan,” a wildland firefighter told me last year. That’s where we are now. Federal, state, and local firefighting agencies are stretched extremely thin, most available resources — tanks, planes, buses, helicopters — are deployed, wildland firefighters are exhausted, and the fires just keep coming. Some 4 million acres have burned so far this year, up from roughly 2.4 million this time last year. There are 104 fires currently burning in 12 states, most of them in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California. Just two of those blazes are contained — meaning firefighters have dug or constructed a perimeter around the fire, significantly slowing or stopping its spread. With severe drought conditions and high fuel loads persisting throughout much of the West, forecasters anticipate above-normal fire potential through September. Howdy — Nathanael here: Over the years, as I’ve reported on wildfire and forest management, I’ve heard the Forest Service say again and again that it wants to befriend fire, only to end up fighting it. That pattern repeated most recently when the agency’s new chief, Randy Moore, announced that the Forest Service would ban prescribed burns and put all of its resources toward aggressive suppression tactics, due to the land being so dry and firefighting resources being stretched so thin. The response from some scientists was almost immediate, asking Moore to reconsider. Sure, it’s very dry, they agreed, but local rangers are better equipped with more tools and choices. And a countrywide prohibition makes little sense when, for instance, heavy monsoon rains have drenched the Southwest, substantially lowering fire risk there from scary levels earlier in the year. The underlying science is clear, they write: “Fire exclusion, along with historic logging that removed larger fire-resistant trees, are in part responsible for our current fire and forest management challenges, with changing climate increasingly acting as a force multiplier.” Moore already knows this. Back in 1910, the Forest Service saw wildfire as the enemy to be quashed and defeated — every blaze quenched by 10 a.m. As a result, the nation’s fire-free forests filled with dry wood — fuel for more severe fires down the road. But in the 1970s and 1980s, the agency started to rethink its approach to fire suppression. By 2001, Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth recognized the completion of fire’s transformation from foe to friend, saying, “We’ll light fires where we can and fight them where we must.” And yet, 20 years later, the Forest Service keeps going back to treating fire as the enemy. Timothy Ingalsbee, head of the nonprofit Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology, told me he’s seen it over and again: “It’s almost a chronic knee-jerk reaction to fall back on this retrograde policy,” he said. Why? A lot of it has to do with the fact that most of the public still sees fire as more intuitively dangerous than the suppression of fire, Ingalsbee said. If someone allows a fire to burn, and then it wipes out a town, that could end their career. But no one ever loses their job for unnecessarily stomping out a fire. No one will be crucified in the press for allowing dangerous fuel loads to build up. Instead, Ingalsbee said, the public at large will pay for it. “Now the bills are coming due,” he said. “We are living in the age of reckoning.” "
https://medium.com/@grist/whats-the-true-cost-of-shipping-all-your-junk-across-the-ocean-97e41b503e71?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"Take a look around your home and you’ll likely find plenty of goods that traveled by cargo ship to your doorstep. A set of IKEA plates made in China. A dresser full of pandemic-era loungewear, ordered on Target and made in Guatemala, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Tracing the impact on the environment from shipping any of these goods is incredibly tricky to do. The data — if you can find it — involves many companies, countries, and cargo carriers. Such obscurity makes it hard to count the full cost of our consumption. But a recent report helps unravel some of the mystery. Two environmental groups, Pacific Environment and Stand.earth, worked with prominent maritime researchers to track goods imported by the 15 largest retail giants in the United States. They then quantified the greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants associated with those imports, usually ferried across the oceans on cargo ships running on dirty bunker fuel. In 2019, importing some 3.8 million shipping containers’ worth of cargo generated as much carbon dioxide emissions as three coal-fired power plants. These shipments also produced as much smog-forming nitrous oxide as 27.4 million cars and trucks do in a year, according to the report. “Our report affirms that these retail giants’ dirty ocean shipping is fueling the climate crisis,” said Madeline Rose, climate campaign director for Pacific Environment and the study’s lead author. The study is the first to trace retailers’ shipping-related emissions, and it used data from a separate, larger project to track the industry’s emissions that’s set to launch in October. The findings are likely just a snapshot of the true environmental toll: Researchers said they could only verify emissions for one-fifth of shipments by the 15 retailers, owing to a lack of data and the companies’ use of shell companies and franchises. The largest retail company in the United States, Walmart, was also the biggest polluter of the bunch. In 2019, Walmart imported enough goods to equal 893,000 shipping containers, resulting in… "
https://medium.com/@grist/the-next-test-for-environmental-justice-policy-defining-disadvantaged-communities-13ab25461529?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"One of President Joe Biden’s first executive orders promised that “disadvantaged communities” would receive at least 40 percent of the overall benefits of government spending on infrastructure, clean energy, and other climate-related programs. It’s a historic commitment to reducing pollution and bringing new investment to the areas most in need. But who the “Justice40” program ends up serving rests, in large part, on a deceptively simple question: What defines a disadvantaged community? While little has been released publicly about how this question is being adjudicated at the federal level, environmental justice leaders are currently grappling with it at the state level in New York, where the idea for Justice40 originated. In 2019, a coalition of Empire State environmental groups successfully lobbied for a similar provision to be included in a statewide climate change bill, now know as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Now, several members of that coalition are participating in a working group that’s developing the state’s official definition for “disadvantaged communities,” or DACs, under the supervision of the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC. This isn’t a matter of crafting a statement that you might find in a dictionary. The unpaid advisory group, which includes the leaders of community organizations from across the state, has a much more complicated task. It involves not only deciding on a set of criteria for the definition, but also choosing the data points that will measure that criteria, and then working out how to combine those data points to score and rank every community in the state. These technical decisions will determine which of New York’s census tracts will be prioritized for pollution cleanup, clean energy programs, job training, public transportation improvements, and energy efficiency upgrades that lower utility bills — and which will not.

https://medium.com/@grist/what-counts-as-a-heat-wave-its-a-life-or-death-question-73f5f28a134b?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"You know a heat wave when you feel it — oppressively hot weather that makes you desperate for an ice-cold drink, or better yet, air conditioning. But nailing down what counts as a heat wave is surprisingly tricky. Temperatures vary widely from place to place — normal summertime weather in Las Vegas would be considered scorching in Seattle. Then there’s the matter of climate change. How do you even say what “normal” temperatures are when heat records are getting obliterated, sometimes over a weekend? This isn’t a matter of semantics. It’s a matter of life and death. Excessive heat, according to the National Weather Service, is the number one weather-related killer in the United States. Defining a heat wave helps cities know when and how to respond to deadly temperatures — issuing heat advisories, sharing tips for surviving the heat, and opening up cooling centers. Recent heat waves across the West have helped fueled wildfires now raging in Oregon, Washington, and California much earlier in the summer than usual. The Southwest blistered in its third heat wave of the summer last weekend, driving temperatures to new record highs. Death Valley had what’s thought to be the hottest 24-hour-period on the planet, averaging 118.1 degrees on Sunday. And last month overall was the hottest June in North America’s recorded history. Two weeks ago, an unprecedented “heat dome” turned the Pacific Northwest into an oven, killing more than 200 people in Washington and Oregon and hundreds more in British Columbia. The heat reached 116 degrees in Portland, breaking streetcar cables. It melted almost three feet of snow off Mount Rainier in Washington and broke Canada’s all-time high at 121 degrees F, fanning the flames of a fire that burned down the town of Lytton in British Columbia. “The temperatures were unbelievable,” said Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle. The heat wave was literally off the charts for what climatologists predicted was possible in the Pacific Northwest right now, she said, and it’s changing… "
https://medium.com/@grist/the-surfside-tragedy-could-be-a-bellwether-moment-for-managed-retreat-6610412c116d?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"The Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, killing at least 18 people with 145 others unaccounted for. It’s too soon to say whether climate change had anything to do with the tragedy. But the collapse has shone a spotlight on Florida’s unique vulnerabilities to climate change and raised questions about whether the state’s coastal infrastructure is equipped to handle the flooding that comes with sea-level rise. The climate stakes for Floridians are high. By 2050, buildings in South Florida may be inundated by 2 to 3 feet of sea-level rise, plus 4 or more feet of storm surge. By 2100, the flooding will be even worse. Some counties might be able to afford to raise their roads and build sea walls. But adapting to rising seas is expensive, complicated, and, ultimately, unsustainable — especially in coastal states like Florida, which will experience intensifying Atlantic hurricanes in addition to sea-level rise. Preventing future tragedies means acting now, said Randall W. Parkinson, a coastal geologist at Florida International University in Miami. He thinks it’s already time to start thinking about moving residents away from the sea. A certain amount of sea-level rise is baked in, given current atmospheric carbon levels, he says. The longer Florida waits to organize the systematic withdrawal of people and assets from the coast, the more chaotic that eventual retreat will be. This retreat-oriented attitude isn’t widely shared in Parkinson’s home state. When he gives presentations on the inevitability of mass migration inland from Florida’s coast, attendees have verbally accosted him and called him “Dr. Doom” — a moniker he rejects. He’s even received threatening messages at his house, he says. “It’s just a terrible, terrible shame in this country how we’ve responded to climate change,” he said. “There’s no leadership.” Grist caught up with Parkinson to talk about climate change, the Surfside tragedy, and what Florida can do to prepare itself for what’s coming down the pike.

https://medium.com/@grist/a-terrible-idea-why-fire-scientists-want-you-to-skip-the-fireworks-this-fourth-of-july-b4bf864ad14b?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"The United States is hot and dry. Large portions of the West are in “exceptional drought,” the most extreme rating assigned by the U.S. Drought Monitor. States that rely on the Colorado River are preparing to ration water. And a hellish heat dome set up camp over the Pacific Northwest this week, smashing temperature records and killing hundreds. As of Wednesday, 36 uncontained large wildfires burned across the nation. The western half of the country is a giant tinderbox. The last thing anyone should be doing there is lighting a match. But that’s exactly what will happen this holiday weekend. Millions of Americans will celebrate Independence Day with fireworks — a classic American tradition. Those fireworks will start fires. Research shows that more fires are ignited on July 4 than any other day of the year. From 1992 to 2015, Americans sparked some 7,000 wildfires on Independence Day. This week, more than 130 fire scientists published an open letter calling on people to skip the fireworks this year. “We are gravely concerned about the potential for humans to accidentally start fires,” the letter reads. Jennifer Balch, an associate professor of geology at the University of Colorado Boulder and one of the signatories of the open letter, gets anxious when she sees fireworks for sale on the side of the road where she lives in Boulder, Colorado. “Fireworks are just a terrible idea,” she told Grist. “It’s so obvious, and yet the response is so scattered in the sense that the decision to ban them is left up to local and state-level decision-making.” A few places have put outright bans on fireworks in place. Colorado has a ban on all fireworks that leave the ground, but sparklers, groundspinners, and other small fireworks are permitted in some counties. Local officials in parts of Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming have considered or enacted bans this year. But the only state in the nation that has put a full ban on all consumer fireworks is… "

The Kryptomon Breeding System has just undergone a significant update, and we are here to give you all the details.‍ The changes are designed to improve the experience of breeders of all Kryptomons and deliver some long-standing changes to bring breeding in line with the original intended design.‍ ‍The baseline cost for breeding will now be determined by the Kryptomons class to help improve the supply of Kryptomon at all strength and market levels. The class of the Kryptomon will use the existing classes defined in the TrainerHub — Elite, Veteran, and Rookie. The fee structure for breeding Kryptomons will remain the same, with each breed costing 10% more per breed. However, this time it’s based on the base fee for that parent:‍ The table above outlines the updates to the overall mutation rate based on the lowest generation in the breeding pair. We have slightly increased the mutation rate for higher generations compared to the previous breeding mutation rates. The minimum positive mutation has moved to a scaled approach vs. a flat amount across all generations previously. The original design on breeding was meant to create significantly higher value in breeding lower generation Kryptomons but that turned out to not be the case in practice. Lower generation Kryptomon now have higher minimum mutation points which when coupled with their lower overall mutation rate will give them much more predictable offspring. For example, previously a Generation 0 Kryptomon would only have had 5 pts potential upside and 0% negative mutation — in the new model, the Generation 0 will now have 15 pts of upside and still 0% negative mutation. To determine the positive mutation you now take the greater of the value in the table and the higher parent’s gene multiplied by the mutation rate. We are continuously trying to improve and balance all the various aspects of the game and we hope that these changes will continue to improve our players’ experiences and create new markets for Kryptomon that previously didn’t exist. So, if you’re a Kryptomon breeder, join us in fostering a balanced breeding economy and get ready to take advantage of this new system! The stage is set, and the opportunities are limitless. We can’t wait to see what amazing new creatures you come up with!‍ Want to learn more about breeding?

[Available on Steam, App Store & Google Play] The premium game, rated at 4.9 on GP, is a UI-based idle game where you are the headmaster of a newly created institution of Magic. The game contains various systems including exploration and fighting battles. The game features over 40 hours of gameplay 🤯 with 6 dozen storylines to be explored. But how did Maticolotto bring this game to reality? Let’s take a look at the interaction I had with the developer: “I love the concept of magic and the idea of using spells to solve nearly every possible situation. At the same time I felt like there’s not many quality incremental games that are not freemium / designed to try to get more money out of the player, so I decided to start the game. Then, when I designed the Apprentices feature, something clicked and I found the game felt actually incredibly fun, to the point I wanted to play it over other games, even if I already knew how everything worked. That inspired me to keep going and eventually finish the game.” “In terms of design: Although I had a rough idea (a few google docs and a spreadsheet to balance some key things, like the exp requirements to level up or the bonuses from retirement) most of it was essentially just building the feature I thought was appealing, playing through, and if it wasn’t fun, rebalance or change things until it became fun. That’s why many of the new discoveries appear as solutions to problems you are haunted by for a while. It also helped I was just focused on building this as a hobby/side project and not really depending on it to make a living — it made it possible for me to focus on making a good game rather than on monetization.” “It took me about 7 months to build the entire game, end to end, working 6+ hours on it every day. But it actually took much longer and most development happened in bursts. After the initial release on Android, I spent 3~4 more months bringing it to other platforms, doing a lot of UI improvements, and adding post-game content” “Marketing: I did no paid promotion on the game, the only thing were two posts on Reddit on /r/incremental_games. My account was banned when I made a third post as I guess Reddit’s systems thought I was a bot. I’ve since gotten it unbanned, but I haven’t done any paid promotion or further promotion frankly.” “I would say at least 50k at this point. To be honest it’s crazy how popular it got. It was a passion project of mine and I realistically didn’t expect to get more than about 200 sales.” “I am working on a second game, yes — which is why there haven’t been many updates on Magic Research for a while! But it’s still too early to announce much.” This should be a solid inspiration for all the game devs out there looking to work on their own projects — Being a solo game developer comes with its own set of constraints — You have to become the artist, designer & marketer of your own game. I have played the game and interaction between different systems is quite good. A perfect recipe for an indie game dev — if you are limited by Art, just make the UI your art!

This article serves as a high-level overview of the process. But none of the code here should be considered production ready. At its core, a cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of money that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Unlike traditional currencies, they are not controlled by any central authority, offering a new way of thinking about money and value transfer. LyronCoin is not just another addition to the multitude of digital currencies; it is designed with unique features that address some of the common challenges faced by existing cryptocurrencies: Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, particularly safe concurrency. It’s known for its ability to produce highly reliable and efficient software that’s less prone to the bugs that can plague systems-level programming. The choice of Rust for developing LyronCoin brings several advantages: Before diving into the creation of LyronCoin, you’ll need to set up your Rust development environment. Follow these steps to get started: With your Rust environment ready, you are all set to embark on the development of LyronCoin. In this section, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of a blockchain that are crucial for building LyronCoin, a robust and secure cryptocurrency. We will explore the nature of blocks, the role of hashing in blockchain technology, and the concept of immutability. Additionally, we will provide Rust code examples to lay the groundwork for your basic blockchain structure. A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This design makes a blockchain resistant to data modification because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. In the context of LyronCoin, a block contains some essential elements: Hashing is a process that takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a ‘digest’ that uniquely represents the input data. In a blockchain, hashing is used to secure the blocks and create a chain of custody. If even a single bit of a transaction is altered, the hash will change drastically, signaling a discrepancy in the data. Immutability refers to the blockchain’s inability to be altered once a block has been added to the chain. This is fundamental to the trust model of blockchain, as it ensures that all transactions are final and unchangeable. Below is a simple Rust code example that demonstrates the creation of a basic blockchain structure. This includes defining a block and a blockchain, hashing, and adding new blocks to the chain. In the provided code, we create a new Block struct with the necessary fields. We then define a Blockchain struct that will hold our chain of blocks. With the add_block method, we can create new blocks and link them to the chain, ensuring they are immutable once added. Transactions are the heart of any cryptocurrency. They are the means by which users exchange value, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and state of the blockchain. A transaction in a cryptocurrency network typically consists of the following components: In LyronCoin, a transaction must be created whenever a user wishes to transfer coins. This involves specifying the amount to be transferred and the recipient’s address. Here’s how you might define a transaction struct in Rust: Signing a transaction is how a user proves they have the right to spend the coins. This is done using their private key. For simplicity, let’s use an external crate like secp256k1 for cryptographic operations. First, add secp256k1 to your Cargo.toml dependencies: Then, implement the signing in Rust: Verification is the process of ensuring that the transaction is valid and the signature is correct. To verify a transaction, you need the public key corresponding to the sender’s private key. The process of creating, signing, and verifying transactions ensures that: A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is essential for cryptocurrencies to operate in a decentralized manner. It allows nodes to communicate directly with each other without the need for a central server. In this section, we’ll outline the setup of a P2P network for LyronCoin, including Rust code snippets for node communication, network synchronization, and the propagation of transactions and blocks. In LyronCoin, nodes must communicate with each other to exchange transaction and block information. We’ll use a TCP-based server-client model for our P2P network. First, add the tokio crate to your Cargo.toml to handle asynchronous operations: Here’s a simple example of how you might establish a TCP connection in Rust using tokio: Network synchronization ensures that all nodes have the same blockchain data. This is done by broadcasting the latest block to all nodes, which then verify and add it to their local blockchain copy. To synchronize the network, you might have a function like this: When a new transaction or block is created, it must be propagated to all nodes in the network. Here’s a simple way to broadcast a new block: LyronCoin nodes can now communicate, synchronize their blockchains, and propagate new transactions and blocks. Mining is a crucial component of many cryptocurrencies. It involves validating transactions, creating new blocks, and maintaining the blockchain’s integrity. In this section, we’ll dive into the mining mechanism for LyronCoin, the role of miners, and the mining rewards system, with Rust code examples to illustrate these concepts. Mining in the context of cryptocurrency is the process of performing complex computations to discover a new block, which is added to the blockchain. This process requires computational effort and is designed to be difficult to ensure network security. Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm used by LyronCoin. It requires miners to solve a cryptographic puzzle to create a new block. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the blockchain and is rewarded with LyronCoin. Miners use their computational power to: Miners are incentivized by: Below is a simplified version of how mining might be implemented in Rust. First, define a struct for your block: Implement the mining function that includes the Proof-of-Work: Function to create and add a block to the blockchain after mining: After a block is mined, reward the miner: Mining is a fundamental aspect of the LyronCoin network that facilitates transaction processing and network security. A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet used to manage cryptocurrencies. It is essential for storing private and public keys, interacting with various blockchains to enable users to send and receive digital currency, and monitor their balance. Key generation in cryptocurrency is typically done using cryptographic algorithms that ensure secure key pairs (public and private keys). Here is a basic Rust example using the secp256k1 library, which is commonly used in cryptocurrencies. First, add the secp256k1 crate to your Cargo.toml: Next, generate a key pair: In a cryptocurrency wallet, the balance is determined by scanning the blockchain for transactions that involve the wallet’s public key. For simplicity, let’s assume LyronCoin has a central ledger that we can query for the balance. To secure transactions, wallets sign them with their private keys. This signature can then be verified by others using the public key. Here’s how you might sign a transaction: To verify the signature: We have established a foundational framework for creating a wallet in LyronCoin, managing balances, and securing transactions. However, it is crucial to handle errors robustly and secure the secret keys adequately in a production environment. Additionally, the actual implementation would require interacting with LyronCoin’s blockchain to fetch balances and verify transactions, which would require more complex networking and storage logic. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They run on a blockchain and automatically enforce and execute the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met. In the context of LyronCoin, smart contracts can add significant value by enabling automated transactions that are transparent, traceable, and irreversible, without the need for a trusted intermediary. These could range from simple fund transfers upon fulfillment of conditions, to more complex decentralized applications (dApps). Here’s an overview of how basic smart contracts could be implemented in LyronCoin using Rust. For our basic implementation, a smart contract will be a Rust struct with an associated function that acts when conditions are met. First, let’s define a simple smart contract struct: Here is how you might use this struct to create and execute a smart contract within LyronCoin: The Rust code examples provided here are simplified to illustrate the concept of smart contracts in LyronCoin. Real-world implementations would need to handle a broad range of conditions, include more complex execution logic, and ensure security through rigorous testing and auditing. Additionally, integrating these smart contracts with the LyronCoin blockchain would involve adding functionality for deploying, calling, and interacting with these contracts on the chain. In the world of cryptocurrency, security is paramount. Even minor oversights can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Rust, with its focus on safety and concurrency, offers many features that can help in creating a secure blockchain. It’s crucial to leverage Rust’s strengths to ensure the LyronCoin blockchain is robust against attacks and operates reliably. Rust provides a built-in test framework that you can use to write unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests. Here are strategies for testing the different components of LyronCoin: Unit tests in Rust are written as functions annotated with #[test] and can be used to test individual modules of your code. For LyronCoin, you would write unit tests for functions handling transactions, block creation, hashing, and consensus algorithms. Here’s an example of a unit test for a simple hashing function: Integration tests are external to your library and use your code in the same way any other code would. This is where you test the interactions between different components of LyronCoin. For instance, you could test how well the transaction system interacts with the blockchain. Property-based tests are designed to test the properties of your code with many random inputs. This is useful for testing the LyronCoin blockchain, where you expect certain properties to hold true, such as the immutability of data within blocks. Rust’s type system and ownership model enforce memory safety guarantees that eliminate certain classes of bugs at compile-time. For LyronCoin, these features mean that many potential security vulnerabilities can be caught early in the development process. The borrow checker ensures that references do not outlive the data they point to and that one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to a resource can exist at a time. This prevents race conditions, which are critical in a concurrent environment like a blockchain network. Pattern matching in Rust is exhaustive, which means all possible cases must be covered when handling an enumeration (enum). This can be used to ensure that all possible states of a transaction or block are considered, reducing the chances of unexpected behavior. Rust’s ownership rules allow for safe concurrency without data races. This is crucial for LyronCoin’s peer-to-peer networking, where multiple threads may access shared resources. Deploying a cryptocurrency like LyronCoin to a live environment is a significant step. It involves setting up a node, launching the network, and ensuring you have the right tools to monitor and maintain it. This tutorial will guide you through the process of taking LyronCoin from development to a live blockchain network. A node is an instance of the LyronCoin software that participates in the network. Each node stores a copy of the blockchain and contributes to the network’s functioning. Prepare the Server: Ensure your server is secure, updated, and has Rust installed. It’s recommended to use a Linux-based OS for better security and performance. Install LyronCoin: Clone the LyronCoin repository from your version control system to the server. Compile the Node: Compile the LyronCoin node using Cargo. Configure the Node: Edit the lyroncoin.conf configuration file to set up network parameters, ports, and other operational settings. Run the Node: Start the LyronCoin node. It will begin to sync with the existing blockchain (if joining an existing network) or await connections (if initiating a new network). If you’re starting a new LyronCoin blockchain, your node will be the first in the network. If you’re joining an existing network, your node will connect to peers. Creating a cryptocurrency is a complex task that requires a solid understanding of both cryptographic and blockchain principles. Rust provides the performance and safety needed for such a task, making it a strong candidate for cryptocurrency development. This tutorial has laid the groundwork for what could evolve into a fully-fledged cryptocurrency. Remember, the key to a successful implementation is rigorous testing and a deep understanding of the underlying technology. I hope you have enjoyed this article.

It’s been a few years since we introduced sound null safety in Dart 2.12. With null safety, you can declare which types are nullable (may contain a value, or null) and which are non-nullable (always contain a value). Null safety combined with flow analysis detects when nullable variables can be “promoted” to their safer, non-null types: Type promotion has been a core part of null safety since Dart 2.12, but was limited to local variables. Fields or top-level variables couldn’t be promoted, such as in a case like this: This limitation was due to several complex cases where flow analysis could not safely determine when or how a field might change. In the case of field promotion on a class, for example, it could be an issue if a subclass overrides a field with a getter, which sometimes returns null. In Dart 3.2, we’ve improved our flow analysis engine and are now able to type promote private final fields. Now, the code snippet above passes without errors. This leverages the understanding that for a private & final field, the value never changes after the initial assignment, so checking it just once is considered safe. Private final field promotion is available starting with Dart 3.2, and will be applied to projects that have a Dart SDK lower bound of 3.2 or higher. Speaking of code analysis, we’ve also made a number of improvements to our standard code analysis rules in package:lints. This package contains the default & recommended set of static analysis rules that comes with any new project created by dart create or flutter create (via package:flutter_lints — an extension of package:lints). A new major version of this lint set, version 3.0, is now available. This revision added six lints to the core set and two lints to the recommended set. It features lints for validating pubspec URLs, validating that collection methods are invoked with the correct arguments, and more. For the full list of changes, check out the changelog. Version 3.0 will be the default for new projects in the coming release. For existing projects, you can upgrade now. Multi-platform support across a wide range of platforms has always been a core principle of Dart. But even though a line of Dart code can run unchanged across all those platforms, large apps still often have a need to interop with existing code. That could mean code from older projects, or APIs available in other libraries or system APIs. We’ve made a number of investments in this area, starting with FFI for interop with native C APIs. We’re currently working on expanding this to support interop with Java and Kotlin and Objective C and Swift. For exciting updates on JS interop, check out the Dart web section further down. As of Dart 3.2, we’ve made a number of improvements to native interop: Dart DevTools is a suite of debugging and performance tools that supports both pure-Dart and Flutter apps. In Dart 3.2 & Flutter 3.16 we’re announcing a new extensions framework which enables package authors to build custom tooling for their package, surfaced directly in DevTools. This allows pub.dev packages that contain frameworks to offer custom tools specific to their use cases. For example, the authors of Serverpod have been hard at work building developer tools for their package and are excited to be shipping a DevTools extension in their upcoming 1.2 release. Wasm (also known as WebAssembly) is an exciting new instruction format for web browsers, which provides a portable, platform-neutral, binary code format for execution in modern browsers. High-level managed languages like Dart use garbage collection, which is being added to the Wasm standard. As of Chrome 119, garbage collection support for Wasm (known as Wasm-GC) is enabled by default. Wasm-GC support is also coming in Firefox 120, their next stable release. So what’s the status with Dart, Flutter, and Wasm-GC? The Dart-to-Wasm compiler is almost feature complete. The team is very happy with performance and compatibility. Our focus now is on edge cases to make sure our output is fast across a broad range of scenarios. For Flutter web, we’ve completed a new “Skwasm” rendering engine. To maximize performance, Swasm connects the compiled application code directly to a custom CanvasKit Wasm module with a wasm-to-wasm binding. It’s also the first iteration of multi-threaded rendering support for Flutter web, which further improves frame times. There are still a few things left before Flutter web with Wasm is ready to graduate out of its current experimental status: We are starting to migrate a number of internal projects to package:web and the new JS interop mechanism, and expect to have more updates in the next stable release. In the meantime, you can get the latest details at our Support for WebAssembly page. That’s all we have for today. Dart 3.2 is available now from dart.dev, or as part of today’s Flutter 3.16 release. Until next time, have fun with Dart! "

Here is a brief overview of various types of linguistics: Focuses on the sounds of speech. For example, it looks at how we pronounce the “p” sound in “pen” compared to the “b” sound in “ben.” Studies the patterns of sounds in a language.

When I’m sitting at my desk in a total mental fog, that’s a clear sign I need a break. Even just getting up to take a quick walk around the office resets my mind. Stretching my legs for 5 minutes helps me return to my tasks feeling more refreshed. Another trick is to put on some lively music. Popping in my motivational playlist instantly uplifts me. Jamming out to a few upbeat songs sparks my enthusiasm and drive. It’s hard not to feel pumped and positive when great tunes are playing. I also try to control my inner voice. When I catch myself thinking negatively, like “I’m just not cut out for this job,” I make an effort to turn my inner dialogue around. Instead, I focus on affirmations like “I’ve got this!” and “I’m capable and energized.” A little self-encouragement goes a long way.

With that said, everyone has a different success story and a unique fate. At times, we all wish to be like Elon Musk or Bill Gates. There’s nothing wrong with comparing yourself to others solely for the purpose of assessing where you stand and how to strive for similar success. However, completely discrediting what you have and constantly longing to be someone else rather than accepting who you are is something you should reconsider. At one point in my life, I would often compare myself to my peers, complaining about who I was and what I possessed. But then, an accident changed my perspective forever. I once had a remarkable friend named Raza Khan. His talents seemed boundless; he was the Einstein of our era, turning over to the complex theories of ‘Modern Physics' as a hobby. If on one hand, he had the sweatiness to speak like Barack Obama, he was a Tendulkar on the cricket field, on the other hand. What I mean to convey is that his academic excellence, communication skills, and passion for sports were all developed to the next level. Many of us envied his talents, sometimes leading to feelings of anxiety and demotivation. He pursued his dream of becoming a doctor, attending Rawlakot Medical College. His future appeared incredibly promising, with numerous opportunities knocking at his door as if the universe had bestowed all its blessings upon him. But then one fateful day, on the way to take over charge of his dream job, just half an hour away from his destination, tragedy struck: A landslide took his life, along with the lives of 40 other passengers on that ill-fated journey. He left forever, not capable of even seeing a moment for what he had strived for. In the aftermath of this devastating loss, I was left with a profound realization: we shouldn’t long for what we lack. Instead, we should appreciate every moment and be grateful for our unique journey. I realized that each one of us is on a different path, with a fate that’s entirely our own. And this is when I learned to embrace our destinies and resist the urge to compare ourselves to others. You might lack something others seem to enjoy. You might look less successful than your peers. But you've got a different fate than the others—and that's perhaps a lot better! Instead of comparing ourselves to others, let’s appreciate the present moment, count our blessings, and celebrate the beautiful uniqueness that makes us just who we are. Author: — Jamil Yousafzai "

Over time, I’ve discovered a few go-to techniques that help me get my groove back when I’m feeling down and disengaged at work. First, I’ve learned that it’s important to listen to my mind and body. When I’m sitting at my desk in a total mental fog, that’s a clear sign I need a break. Even just getting up to take a quick walk around the office resets my mind. Stretching my legs for 5 minutes helps me return to my tasks feeling more refreshed. Another trick is to put on some lively music. Popping in my motivational playlist instantly uplifts me. Jamming out to a few upbeat songs sparks my enthusiasm and drive. It’s hard not to feel pumped and positive when great tunes are playing. I also try to control my inner voice. When I catch myself thinking negatively, like “I’m just not cut out for this job,” I make an effort to turn my inner dialogue around. Instead, I focus on affirmations like “I’ve got this!” and “I’m capable and energized.” A little self-encouragement goes a long way. When I feel my motivation seriously lagging, I take some time to step back and look at the bigger picture. Reflecting on how my role positively impacts others recharges my drive. I also look at reminders of… "

I discovered Snapchat when one of our family friends introduced it to me during a birthday party in 2011. She was only 14 years old and presented it to us passionately. Since then, I got hooked. I also use Snapchat with my gaming friends as a communication tool. This post will include the key points you need to consider when using Snapchat, provide some practical tips for maximizing its benefits, and delve into the app’s history and benefits for different professionals. My goal is to introduce Snapchat, which is a unique social media tool, and help you maximize your communication with this unique tool and experience the magic of Snapchat Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app that allows users to send photos, videos, and messages that disappears if they aren’t saved. Additionally, users can post photos and videos onto their “Story,” which will only be visible for 24 hours. With its unique features and continuously evolving platform, Snapchat has become popular for personal and professional use. Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown founded Snapchat in 2011 while they were students at Stanford University. Since then, I have been using it daily. The app was initially designed to send disappearing messages but has since evolved to include many features and services. Snapchat has become especially popular among young adults and teenagers, with over 250 million daily active users as of 2021. The app has also gained a reputation for being a platform for sharing inappropriate content, which has led to criticism and calls for increased moderation. Despite these challenges, Snapchat has also been recognized for its potential as a marketing and communication tool. Many… "

He mentions that: “No matter how young we are unless we address insulin resistance and become insulin sensitive, our waistlines will grow.” This informative and engaging article titled “Three Tips to Eliminate Insulin Resistance and Shrink Waistline” gave me valuable perspectives about the role of insulin resistance on gaining fat, causing metabolic diseases, and increasing obesity globally. At the start of his article, Dr Yildiz asks two questions to set the context for his audience. The first question is, “Do you want to shrink the size of your waistline and gain a defined body?” The second question is, “Are you a lazy or hardworking person? He asks these questions because, according to him, different solutions address insulin resistance based on our personality and lifestyle choices. He thinks that if we prefer a slow flow in our daily life without putting much effort, he offers practical solutions to become insulin sensitive and shrink our waistline. But, on the other hand, if we like a day full of physical activities, we also have a viable solution. We know that losing belly fat is not easy.

But today, I’m diving into the scoop on a fresh rhythm mode dropping in Fortnite soon! Fortnite got a sneak peek leak that hints at a new Rhythm Mode on the horizon, starring big-shot artists like Linkin Park and Lady Gaga. The game’s got this buffet of modes, each with its own rules and fun factor. Some stick around for a while, others shuffle in and out every season. We’re talking Team Rumble, Party Royale, Battle Lab, Zero Build, and Impostors — they’re the core gang. Now and then, Fortnite fans rally up to ask the devs for a permanent addition. Remember when they pushed hard for Zero Build, focusing more on shooting than building? Some even begged for the OG map to stick around permanently for the old-school feels. The return of the OG map smashed records for concurrent players, making Epic Games face a dilemma: keep it around or pull the plug eventually? This latest leak, straight from HYPEX, spills the beans on a Rhythm mode dropping on December 9. It’s going to feature big names like Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, and Toto, letting players jam on vocals, drums, guitar, and bass, stepping into the shoes of these artists. And hey, there’s a lineup of legendary tracks on the cards, along with some sweet freebies. But hold your horses — leaks are leaks until Epic Games gives the green light. Here’s a peek at what this Rhythm Mode might offer: If this leak pans out, this musical extravaganza kicks off a week after the OG Season wraps up. Folks are buzzing about possible rewards — some Redditors are thinking emotes inspired by the songs might land. "
https://medium.com/technology-hits/check-out-this-insane-unannounced-intel-cpu-383c26409d79?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"In my past stories, I’ve talked about all sorts of PC stuff. You can find those linked at the end here. But today, I’m diving into something wild: a brand-new, totally bonkers Intel CPU that no one saw coming. If you’re not vibing with Intel’s kinda of weak 6GHz Intel Core i9–14900K Raptor Lake Refresh CPU, hold up, there might be hope. There’s talk of a new version, still under wraps, blazing 200MHz faster. Say hi to the Core i9 14900KS, that crucial “S” telling you it’s a 6.2GHz beast. So, get this: Israeli rig builder PCOnline has it listed on their site, no joke. As we speak, those 14900KS-powered machines are just chillin’ there. Now, before you get too hyped, this isn’t Intel’s official deal. But it seems legit — the chip matches up with the right specs, is snug in PCOnline’s system, and is ready for a variety of setups. Doesn’t seem like a slip-up either. Someone at PCOnline’s definitely banking on that 6.2GHz 14900KS. FYI, in case you’re curious about numbers, a basic rig with the 14900KS, 16GB RAM, no fancy GPU, and a 512GB SSD hits around $1,214. Swap that out for a regular Core i9 14900K, and it’s $1,051. The actual prices might not be a deal-breaker, but that $163 extra for the new 6.2GHz chip fits Intel’s trend for charging more for the “S” versions of their OG Raptor Lake crew. Just to give you a rundown, the previous-gen Core i9 13900K goes for roughly $550, while the 13900KS costs a tad under $700. The latest 14900K sits around $590 currently. If we follow the pattern, the 14900KS might hit the shelves at a probable $750 or even a smidge lower. Now, paying that much extra for a mere 200MHz might sound wild. Let’s be real, you won’t feel a 3% speed bump most of the time. But here’s the flip side — if you’re dead-set on squeezing every drop of performance from an Intel i9 desktop CPU, this Core i9 14900KS (if it’s for real) will likely be the cream of the crop, hitting those insane clock speeds.

But right now, I’m diving into a new patent from Nintendo that might hint at a fresh console. Nintendo’s supposedly cooking up something new — a dual-screen gaming gadget, split in two. Rumors started buzzing after alleged patent filings emerged in November 2022. But hey, don’t go planning your gaming sessions just yet! A patent doesn’t guarantee a product’s real-life debut. So, where’s this scoop from? According to whispers on the World Intellectual Property Organisation site (thanks to eagle-eyed folks at ResetEra and GameRant), this Nintendo brainchild resembles the good ol’ DS and 3DS handhelds, rocking that dual-screen setup. But hold up! This new gadget steps it up a notch — the top and bottom halves can go solo, a feature the DS and 3DS missed out on. Plus, even when it’s closed, there’s still a screen peeking out from the outside. The patent application’s got some tech talk: But wait, Nintendo’s no stranger to patent parties. They’ve thrown down a bunch before, like one for an oval-shaped handheld, but those dreams often stayed in the “patent pending” zone. So, this… "

You can find those linked at the end here. But today, I’m diving into Nvidia’s newest top-of-the-line graphics card! As we gear up for the new year, the buzz around 2024’s PC hardware is starting to brew. Yep, it’s that time again — rumor central! Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell series is still a ways off, so take all the juicy leaks and rumors with a pinch of salt. But hey, here’s a somewhat safer bet: the high-end GB202 GPU might roll out sporting GDDR7 memory. And if we’re feeling adventurous, there’s chatter about a 384-bit memory bus too. The notorious hardware leaker and Kimi Räikkönen superfan, @kopite7kimi, previously hinted that the GB202 (set to power the anticipated RTX 5090) could rock a hefty 512-bit bus. But now the word on the street — well, Twitter — is that kopite7kimi is leaning towards a more conservative 384-bit bus for this beast. Sure, there’s still ample time for Nvidia to tinker with the final specs before the big RTX 50-series release. But it’s a pretty safe bet that both Nvidia and AMD will jump on the GDDR7 bandwagon for their top-tier cards. This new memory tech has been cooking in the labs of Micron and Samsung, set to hit shelves in 2024. Samsung spilled some details last month — expect blazing 32Gbps speeds in the initial rollout, a lower voltage, and a 50% drop in standby power. While GDDR7 isn’t mass-produced yet, you can bet your graphics card collection that high-end GPUs will be among the first to snatch up these fresh memory chips. Here’s the tech lowdown: GDDR7’s higher bandwidth might make a wider memory bus less crucial. With speeds potentially hitting 32Gbps from the get-go, we’re eyeing a whopping total bandwidth of 1.5TB/s over that 384-bit bus. That’s a jaw-dropping 50% hike from the RTX 4090’s 21Gbps GDDR6X memory and 384-bit bus. But hold onto your seats because there’s more in the rumor mill about GB202. Talk swirls around a chiplet architecture, possibly reserved for the enterprise-level Blackwell… "

Season 2 just dropped, and it’s screaming about how massive the MCU has grown, diving headfirst into the multiverse mayhem. Who would’ve doubted that the animated series would bounce back on Disney Plus? But this new trailer for Season 2 hints at diving deeper into the multiverse mania that’s entangled in Marvel’s recent live-action flicks and series. It’s not just a hint; it’s practically a flashing neon sign pointing at exciting things ahead. Remember how Season 1 almost ripped reality apart by meddling with folks’ lives? Well, The Watcher (Jeffrey Wright) is back up to his old tricks in Season 2. He’s keeping a hawk-eye on peculiar variants from Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and more. The first season was all about individual origin tales, but the new sneak peek brings together unlikely squads. Think Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), a mystery T’Challa variant, and a green Kree/Captain Marvel uniform-clad woman who sounds suspiciously like Annette Bening. But hold your horses, they’re on the hunt for a younger Peter Quill with powers never seen in the live-action Guardians movies. Brace yourselves! Season 2 is rolling out a new hero — Kahhori, a Mohawk warrior encountering the Tesseract way back in pre-colonial times. And if that’s not enough, buckle up for some juicy tales featuring fan-favorite Marvel peeps: Nebula, Hela, and Happy Hogan. Yep, the latter’s set to rock a Die Hard-esque Christmas caper at Stark Towers. Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more festive, Marvel’s dropping a single holiday-themed episode, but the buzz around it’s like they’ve wrapped up a grand present for fans.

And the Snowball is one of Blue’s most popular offerings, coming in at a super budget friendly $49.99. The Snowball is especially good if you’re streaming with friends, as its omnidirectional setting can pick up everybody’s voices loud and clear. A mic arm doesn’t necessarily need to break the bank. While the Neewer Mic Arm might not be as robust as the Rode PSA-1, it still can get the job done for a variety of microphones, and is a steal at the low price of $12.50 Depending on your streaming setup, you might require a bit more light so you look good on your webcam. Because of their smaller sensors, webcams need good light in order to have a good framerate. If you want some extra lighting on the cheap, a simple desk lamp can do the trick.

That said, today we’re thrilled to strut our revamped style! Having put a whole new spin on the familiar, what you’ll see is a bolder rendition of our beloved play icon. Combined with a fresh coat of colors and edgy visuals, we think it’s downright epic. But you’re welcome to consider it symbolic of the content revolution, if you wish. That’s not all. There’s lots more to explore beyond our new logo, so check out our brand new website, packaging (coming soon), social media assets, and let us know your thoughts. We want to ensure that the YouTube and Twitch collective knows about this exciting transformation. For that, we need your help. If you have banners, overlays, or any other assets featuring our current logo, we’d greatly appreciate you updating them to the new version — which you’ll find HERE. What do you think of the new logo and style?

The holidays are upon us, and while it’s an important time to spend with your family and loved ones, it’s also the universal season to get cool new stuff. So whether you’re looking for a gift for that creator in your family, or perhaps you want to splurge on yourself, check out our recommendations throughout the week and piece together your perfect content creation rig. The final section of our 4 part guide focuses on mobile streaming setups. This is extremely important for streamers, since if you make content for YouTube, it’s possible to schedule videos while you’re away at an event or a vacation. Streamers don’t have this luxury, and if you’ve established your audience at this point, you don’t want to risk losing that by being AFK for too long. So check out our recommendations for the equipment that will keep you connected with your fans, no matter where you go. The HD60 S is the ultimate capture card to take with you on your travels. With a USB 3.0 Type-C port, the HD60 S lets you enjoy the benefits of instant gameview wherever you go, and you can stream or record your favorite console or PC game up to 1080p/60fps. You might recognize this laptop from our high end setup recommendations. Well being that it’s basically a portable desktop, it’s great for mobile setups as well. This laptop will easily handle streaming and recording, and if you’re so inclined, you can download some PC games on this thing, it can handle it. This laptop also comes equipped with a webcam, though if you want to use a higher quality one, webcams like the Logitech C922 won’t take up too much room. The Gechic 1303i is a 13” 1080p portable touch screen display. It is powered via a USB + Wall adapter, and has inputs for display port, VGA, and HDMI. If you’re a traveling content creator, sometimes the place you stay doesn’t have a viable TV to play on. Either there’s some form of security on the ports of the TV, it’s an off label “Sonny” TV with a high input lag, or it’s just a 720p display (as most TVs around the 32” mark are). The Gechic 1303i allows you to travel with a low input lag, 1080p display wherever you go, so you have something to play your console games on. This is highly valuable not just so you have a pleasant gaming experience, but you’re able to record or stream in 1080p 60fps. If you’re looking for a cheaper alternative, check out the GAEMS M155 which is only $169.99, but it’s 720p. Receiver of rave reviews, the Xbox One S is a new slim version of the Xbox One system, and comes with, if you opt for it, a larger hard drive. In this mobile setup we’re recommending, the system will be the largest piece, so if size is a concern for you, the Xbox One S is one of the most travel friendly console currently out, second only to the Wii U. Not only will the A40 TRs allow you to hear your competition and play at your best, the A40 TR system also has a Mixamp equipped with a Stream Port, allowing you to output game audio, party chat audio, and your own live commentary audio into your Elgato capture card. While the mic quality isn’t Blue Yeti level, if you’re looking to keep your setup somewhat light, this is a fantastic option to go with. You’ll need a bag to throw all this gear into, and you can’t do much better than the Astro Scout bag. This thing has some serious storage power, and is built like a tank. If you’re looking for a bag with some lasting value to carry your gear, we highly recommend the Scout.

The holidays are upon us, and while it’s an important time to spend with your family and loved ones, it’s also the universal season to get cool new stuff. So whether you’re looking for a gift for that creator in your family, or perhaps you want to splurge on yourself, check out our recommendations throughout the week and piece together your perfect content creation rig. Part 3 of this 4 part guide will focus on the high end setups for content creation. If you’re looking to put out the highest quality content, this is what you’ll need to do so. Be on the lookout for our next installment where we cover mobile setups! If you’re looking to get full desktop power in laptop form, you can’t do much better than the ASUS ROG. Equipped with a Core i7 6700HQ and a GTX 1070, this laptop can handle most gaming applications with ease, and will handle any type of recording or streaming task you can throw at it. For full power though, check out this custom desktop configuration, rocking the Core i7 6700K, GTX 1070, 32GB of RAM, and water cooled to boot. Not only do you get a boost in power with the Desktop, but you’re also able to use the Elgato HD60 Pro as well. 1080p 60fps. Instant Gameview. Master Copy. The HD60 Pro is the ultimate capture card for the content creator. Whether you’re recording, streaming, or both, the HD60 Pro handles them all flawlessly. The only question you have to ask (after reading the next recommendation) is do you want 1 or 2? The best part about being a content creator is connecting with your fans. So let them see you in the highest quality possible. Not only can the Canon HG40 be used for YouTube content creation like VLogs or Commentary videos, but you can connect this camera to an Elgato HD60 S or HD60 Pro and turn it into an amazing 1080p/60fps webcam! If you need some serious lighting, look no further. One of these lights has 600 LEDs on them with a dimmer, allowing you a ton of control over how much light your video or stream needs. 2 work best so you can have them on either side for a nice even lighting, and these things help out chroma keying a ton too. A little pricier than a CFL soft box set, but these have a much smaller profile when broken down, have a lot higher lumen output, and run cooler. Just don’t forget to pick up light stands as they’re sold separately. Once you get into professional audio, there is a myriad of different options you can go with. And honestly there are a lot of strong contenders out there. But in our testing, the Rode Procaster puts out amazing quality for the price. If you’re looking to go into high end, this microphone will perform admirably. You’ll need the Focusrite Scarlet 2i2 interface to use this XLR microphone on your computer. This setup will give you the best quality, and gives you the freedom to add in a second microphone if you so wish. If you want to save some money, the Rode Podcaster USB also performs very well. If you’re going to be broadcasting at the highest level, you should be playing at the highest level as well. There’s no better way to do so than with these 2 weapons in your arsenal. The Astro A40 TR will let you hone in on your enemies with its virtual surround sound, so no one gets the jump on you in an FPS, and its extensive output options make capturing your conversations with your friends on PS4/Xbox a breeze. And with a Scuf controller, you’ll be able to decimate the competition with its patented Scuf Paddles. Map face buttons to these paddles to be able to hit those controls without your thumbs leaving the joysticks, giving you the competitive edge online or at tournaments. And the best part is you’re able to customize the controller to fit your personality or to go along with the rest of your creator cave.

The holidays are upon us, and while it’s an important time to spend with your family and loved ones, it’s also the universal season to get cool new stuff. So whether you’re looking for a gift for that creator in your family, or perhaps you want to splurge on yourself, check out our recommendations throughout the week and piece together your perfect content creation rig. Part 2 of this 4 part guide will focus on mid range setups for the content creator. These accessories should be a welcome addition to most creator caves out there. Stay tuned to later this week when we cover high end setups and mobile setups! The Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 is a great sub-$1000 notebook equipped with an i7 6700HQ processor and an AMD Radeon R9 M375 GPU. It’ll handle streaming with ease, and will zip through your other day to day tasks with its included 128GB SSD. But don’t worry, it’s also got a 1TB HDD to store all of the recordings you’ll be making with this bad boy. And with its USB 3.0 ports, it’s 100% compatible with the Elgato HD60 S! If desktops are more your speed, this configuration will be quite the stream machine and will handle gaming quite admirably as well, with its GTX 1060 GPU and 16GB of RAM. The HD60 S is the latest Capture Card from yours truly. Armed with a USB 3.0 Type-C port, the HD60 S gives you instant gameview in your recordings or streams anywhere you go. You’re able to plug and play no matter the software you use. The HD60 S does require a more powerful machine than the HD60 Pro or HD60, but if you’re rocking a rig like we recommended above, you’ll be all set to record or stream 1080p/60fps wherever you go. The C922 is the successor to the ever popular C920 camera. Logitech’s latest offering brings 720p/60fps to the picture, which will let your webcam feed be as smooth as your game feed. And at only $79.99, simply put, it’s currently the best webcam on the market at the moment. If you’re looking to save a bit of money, the C920 is still available at an even more affordable 59.99. One thing to keep in mind with the C922 is since it’s a 60fps webcam, you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of light since the shutter speed is twice as fast letting in half as much light. Check out our recommendation below for some mid range lighting solutions. These little lights are a nice addition for the mid range setup. At $23.99 a pop(tripod sold separately), they’re a bit more expensive than buying a few desk lamps, but the big benefit of these is that they are dimmable, which can allow you to tweak the lighting to your preference without worrying about a diffusion solution. These lights are also battery operated, which is great for portability, but you may want to pick up some Sanyo Eneloops so you don’t burn through a ton of batteries. Need more lighting power? Stay tuned to part 3 of our gift guide to see some higher end lighting to use for your content. The Blue Yeti microphone has been the golden standard for content creators for years now. At only 129 dollars, the Yeti is armed with cardioid, omnidirectional, stereo, and bidirectional pickup patterns, so whatever situation you might need good audio, the Yeti has you covered. The yeti comes grounded on a heavy aluminum mic stand, but is also compatible with standard microphone arms like the Rode PSA1. To go along with your spanking new setup, you’ll need a snazzy keyboard to match. The Corsair K40 does just that. Whether you’re a PC Gamer, or if you just want a high quality keyboard for your day to day tasks, the K40 handles them all with ease. And the best part? RGB! Of course you need a matching mouse to go along with your Keyboard. With up to 10k DPI and a smooth black finish with RGB accenting, the Sabre is a great performing mouse and looks great too. And at under 50 dollars, it doesn’t break the bank. Be sure to check out our other holiday gift guides on: Budget Setups High End Setups and Mobile Streaming Setups "

The holidays are upon us, and while it’s an important time to spend with your family and loved ones, it’s also the universal season to get cool new stuff. So whether you’re looking for a gift for that creator in your family, or perhaps you want to splurge on yourself, check out our recommendations throughout the week and piece together your perfect content creation rig. This will be a 4 part holiday guide, focusing on budget setups, mid range setups, high end setups, and mobile setups. Today we’re focusing on budget minded items to help you get started in content creation. These items are picked due to their bang for buck value and their ability to get you making content without breaking the bank. The Ideapad 700 is one of the most affordable laptops available today that meets the requirements for both recording and streaming with webcam, overlays, etc. With a quad-core i5 processor and an Nvidia GTX 950m, it’ll be able to handle most tasks you throw at it. If you’re looking to save a bit more money, look into custom desktop builds, as you’re able to dial in your price point with each component you choose. Something like this configuration will meet the minimum requirements for recording and streaming. The one that started it all. Game Capture HD is our most wallet friendly capture card and is a great first card to accompany you on your YouTube or Twitch journey. With HDMI, component, and composite/S-video input options, Game Capture HD can handle just about any system you throw at it. This is great if you’re unsure about which game you’d like to specialize in. Game Capture HD can record up to 720p/60fps or up to 1080p/30fps. If you’re looking for 1080p/60 quality, you may want to consider spending a little bit more and opting for the Game Capture HD60. If you don’t happen to have a webcam already, you can’t really beat the value of the C310. You’ll get 720p/30fps video at under 30 dollars. With webcams in general, we recommend good light sources for better performance — if you’re in a dimly lit room, that 30fps can easily turn into 10fps. Need some lighting? Keep reading! When you use a webcam for video, lighting is everything. The cheapest form of lighting you can use is a window paired with some sunlight, but since that isn’t always available, you’ll want to pick up some desk lamps to pump up the brightness in your space. These desk lamps can sit right on top of furniture, and they have goosenecks so you can eaisly position the light where it needs to go. You can’t go wrong with these for under 10 dollars a pop. Just don’t forget some light bulbs! Finally, you need a microphone so the world can hear you. And at under 40 dollars, you can’t do much better than the Samson Go Mic. Armed with a cardioid, omnidirectional, and -10db setting, the Samson Go Mic is an all around good budget mic for live streaming or live commentaries. -10db will give you optimal audio quality, but you may want to do yourself a favor and pick up a pop filter if you’re using this setting. We hope this helps out for all you content creators on a budget. Be sure to check out our other holiday gift guides on: Mid-Range Setups High End Setups and Mobile Streaming Setups "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/the-mental-health-stigma-that-still-lurks-in-medicine-4f281e97b29f?source=collection_home---------0----------------------------,"It’s May, and mental health awareness month has started. Every year I look forward to the social media programming: the people who share stories of recovery, those receiving support for their current struggles, and the community of providers on social media sharing amazing mental health content. I feel so much solidarity with all of these groups because I’ve been one of them at some point in my life. As a psychotherapist and someone who identifies as a wounded healer, I feel so honored to witness others’ stories, especially on social media. Even just a few years ago, some people wouldn’t dare share their stories on the internet for anyone to view. And now, people come together from all over the world to share and provide education on mental health issues. Shared stories make the world a better place. Speaking our experiences and hearing the experiences of others helps us connect with others in a meaningful way. It helps us to know that suffering is part of the human condition; we all suffer. Knowing we have the backing and support of an entire community helps us bear challenges. It has been a true joy to see the stigma around mental health challenges slowly dismantled. But this past week I experienced a rude awakening that jarred me to my core. It showed me we still have a very long way to go. I am a very active member of the medical and therapy community on several social media platforms. I follow other medical and therapy providers, mental health advocates, and people who just want to learn more about mental health. A psychologist posted about how physicians (Medical Doctors; MDs) should not be diagnosing personality disorders. Personality disorders are defined by the American Psychiatric Association as “long-term patterns of behavior and inner experiences that differ significantly from what is expected.” Personality disorders are mental health diagnoses that require specialized training (perhaps above and beyond other disorders) and a good foundational knowledge of the person over time. Personality disorders… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/dialectical-behavior-therapy-is-not-always-the-most-effective-treatment-for-borderline-personality-f8e6ca2d544c?source=collection_home---------1----------------------------,"In the psychiatric community, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) tend to be spoken in the same breath. Diagnosed with BPD? Then you need to enter DBT treatment. I was one of those individuals for whom DBT was the first-line treatment when I was diagnosed with BPD in 1990, following my second suicide attempt. According to the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder (NEABPD), “BPD can be defined as a serious mental illness that centers on the inability to manage emotions effectively. The disorder occurs in the context of relationships: sometimes all relationships are affected, sometimes only one.” The NEABDP states that “BPD usually begins during adolescence or early adulthood.” However, three decades ago, I was not diagnosed until I was twenty-nine years old. At the time I was diagnosed, Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., a psychologist from The University of Washington had developed a new treatment designed to treat patients who had high rates of suicide attempts. The innovative treatment, known as dialectical behavior therapy or DBT contained elements of Zen and consisted of four modules: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation and Distress Tolerance. The definitive manual, “Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder,” was published in 1993. I was fortunate in that I received my diagnosis prior to the onset of managed care and the era of insurance companies' tendency to dictate treatment. Following a brief acute inpatient stay in New York City, I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in a northern suburb of Manhattan. The hospital had a long-term unit dedicated to treating individuals diagnosed with BPD, specializing in DBT. Even with the intense stigma attached to BPD in the 1990s, the staff on the long-term unit had chosen to work with us, from the psychiatrists to the nurses to the social workers. The eighteen patients (all women) on the unit formed a cohesive… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/the-high-price-of-loneliness-and-a-low-cost-solution-3d5cceb98849?source=collection_home---------2----------------------------,"Since the beginning, humans have needed others — regardless of gender, ethnicity, or geographic location, we are social creatures. Quality relationships make us happier, healthier, and more productive. Social support buffers stress and fulfills an important psychological need to belong and feel accepted by others. In an ideal, harmonious world, we would all enjoy plenty of health-protecting relationships, but that is not the reality for many. A startling number of people struggle with loneliness. As recently as 2020, a survey of 10,400 adults living in the United States found that 61% reported feeling lonely, a 7% increase from the previous year. With the ongoing pandemic, I expect those numbers to be even higher this year. Loneliness and its subsequent effects have become a significant societal concern that impacts health across the lifespan. Until recently, I was the only behavioral health provider in a small primary care clinic. Starting in March 2020, when the world shut down, my caseload skyrocketed. Every therapy appointment was quickly booked, and I struggled to keep up with the burgeoning demand. A large portion of my client population were individuals who lived alone and were suddenly completely isolated. Like all of us, they were no longer able to go to the gym, grocery store, or movie theater. Worse yet, they were by themselves at home too. This profound loss of connection ignited depressive symptoms in many people. The realization that they would remain isolated for an unknown amount of time was emotionally crushing. It wasn’t just people living alone who were suffering. My patients who lived with others, but had a difficult or disconnected relationship, also struggled. Even in a room full of people, we can feel lonely. When we lack meaningful connections with others, we feel isolated and this can trigger a deep, penetrating loneliness. Loneliness is a significant health threat. It increases both the risk for depression and the severity of depressive symptoms. Loneliness leads to emotional pain that impacts all age groups… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/gratitude-and-depression-impossible-companions-66b93a86a188?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"The promotion of gratitude is a big deal in the self-improvement literature. Gratitude is a heavy hitter in one’s well-being, health and relationships. It is especially salient this week which mandates that we focus on those things for which we are thankful, and share those declarations over long, groaning tables of food. In my childhood and young adulthood, my list of “gratitudes” lined up like planes on a runway. I had to make economic decisions about which ones I would share with fellow diners. The early ones were acquisitive. Stuff I’d wanted and got, through no effort of my own. Barbie’s Dream House, the Cinderella watch in a plastic slipper, a birthday gift from my father that remains one of my most treasured possessions. My parents, concerned with my materialistic bent, would cut in, “How about your new baby sister?” Before I’d learned how to lie for the greater good, I answered simply, “No.” As I became a player in the world, my thankfulness focused on the positive results of my goals and efforts. I was good at a lot of things. I was very smart. I got accepted into exclusive training as a psychologist. I persevered. I did well. So well that I considered myself ready for marriage at age (gasp) 21. In the midst of graduate school, I decided I was ready for motherhood at 24 (double gasp). My daughter was a treasure. The bounty of my gratitude was basically a list of accomplishments. When it came right down to it, I was grateful to myself. Entitlement shadowed thankfulness. Yes, I was grateful for my many blessings, but I assumed that they were basically part of the plan for my life. For a budding clinical psychologist, I gave surprisingly little reflection on the whys and hows of it all. And I definitely neglected to consider that these things didn’t come with a lifetime guarantee. And then the bottom caved in. I fell far. And then I crashed. My “resume of gratitude” mocked me as I lost more and more parts of myself that piloted my life and my relationships. The perseverance I had once prized was worthless. My agony clung to me and led me down roads that… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/adhd-diaries-are-social-relationships-just-a-fantasy-8c7ee16ab8e9?source=collection_home---------4----------------------------,"In the third installment of our series, we’ll delve into how an adult brain with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) functions differently and how this can complicate social interactions. If you’ve ever struggled to make friends, join us as we explore the reasons behind these challenges. I began sharing my experiences with adult ADHD last month with the first article of the series, “ADHD Diary: The Mischief Maker.” The last piece has also examined this neurodevelopmental disorder from the perspective of someone with ADHD, discussing its impact on adult life and the symptoms we live with. Starting to research the topic inevitably leads to the question of why this is considered a “difference.” What makes us unique? Why does our brain work differently? Let’s try to understand what happens in an ADHD brain, combining scientific research with my own experiences. An article published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology in 2002 explains the differences in the brains of people with ADHD as follows: Connectivity Differences: ADHD brains show significant differences in neurotransmitter levels. Key chemical messengers, particularly norepinephrine and dopamine, are found at different levels in ADHD brains. These neurotransmitters affect many fundamental brain functions, such as attention, motivation, and emotional responses. Brain Region Differences: In ADHD brains, there are structural differences in areas like the frontal cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia. The frontal cortex regulates behavior, emotions, and attention, the limbic system influences emotions and motivation, and the basal ganglia… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/how-i-hid-my-autism-for-25-years-6ffac5e4805f?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"In the last couple of years following my autism diagnosis, I have gone on an archaeological dig to find all the childhood signs that were missed. Remembering how I memorized every single dog breed in elementary school or my adolescent love for the trampoline, I looked to my parents, my primary care physician, to all the adults in my life and questioned how autism could have possibly been overlooked. The short answer is this: I was a girl born in rural Michigan in 1998. My Deafness, only diagnosed at age five, was barely acknowledged, let alone the possibility of a non-typical neurotype. While I cannot go back and change the past, I can present my findings in the hopes that they spark some recognition in yourself or your loved ones. Too many people of color, girls, and femmes, and people with other disabilities fall through the cracks of our medical system. This is my story of being one of them. When I was three years old, I still hadn’t said my first word. From the vague details my parents shared with me, this was when the first intervention happened. I was sent to a preschool program for toddlers with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the cassette tapes from this time period, I can see other autistic children I would later attend mainstream school with. The documents I was able to get a hold of include concerned writings from the teachers: “Annika does not socialize with the other children.” My lack of response to sound was also expressed. Sometime after this, my hearing loss was finally detected, and with that, any other pathology was subsequently dismissed. I was the first child, so my parents could easily write off my early autistic traits as me being “shy” and a “picky eater.” Fitted with hearing aids just a few months shy of kindergarten, I was noticeably behind. Suddenly thrust into a world of unintelligible sounds, I struggled. Twice a week, I was pulled out of class for speech therapy sessions. As soon as I could speak with only a mild Deaf accent, I was thrown to the wolves of elementary school social life. When I couldn’t make friends with my peers, I constructed snowmen solo or talked… "

I promise I do not mean this to sound condescending, but those who have never experienced clinical depression do not know what it is like. They cannot. I, for instance, cannot know how somebody confined to a wheelchair and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to war feels like. I can guess, I can sympathize. But I cannot empathize. I cannot understand. Which is why most readers will probably dismiss the opening sentence of this article as a sensationalist claim, a cool way to start an essay. But believe me, I truly, genuinely thought I would die by 2019. I still have that fear, that one day I will wake up and realize I do not want to live anymore. But I am no longer in the thick of clinical depression. Finally, finally I am at a place where I can honestly claim to be without depression. Looking back, I realize it must have taken a superhuman effort for me to keep living. What many misunderstand about depression is they think those who are depressed feel sad for a short period of the day. But clinical depression is every second of every day, without reprieve, without breaks, all the time. It affects and compromises every aspect of one’s life. I have lost count of the fifteen-minute panic attacks, the breakdowns, the crying, the outbursts, the self-harm, the self-loathing. When I look at the scars on my body now I feel baffled I would do that to myself. But back then it felt like the only way to cope. If I felt a panic attack incoming, or if I could not stop crying, I would cut myself. The pain would ground me. I did some wild things back in the day. I once walked the streets with the express intention of getting hit by a car, and almost did; I hurt my best friends on purpose so they would leave, which I thought they eventually would anyway; I ran away from home and almost shoplifted. I remember one time I walked for four or five hours straight in the darkness and for reasons I still do not understand, tossed my wristwatch in some… "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/could-going-keto-help-your-mental-health-5b0fe0d58c32?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"Originally created in 1921 to help epilepsy treatment in children, the ketogenic diet has its origins in helping improve neurological health. Since its invention, scientists have found it helpful for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and many other neurological conditions. Since then, it has also become a fad diet among many health and wellness influencers. Touted for its ability to suppress hunger and stabilize blood sugar, the ketogenic diet is one that is rising in popularity among many fitness enthusiasts and dieters. There is growing research to show that the ketogenic diet is also beneficial for brain health and stabilizing neurotransmitters in the body helping to regulate mood and improve symptoms for many psychiatric patients. In case you have been hiding for the last decade, the ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein but gains the majority of its nutrition from fats like avocados and coconut oil. The goal of a ketogenic diet is to be in a state of “ketosis.” In other words, your body is no longer using glucose for its fuel, but ketones instead. That means that your blood glucose levels stay very low on average around 60 to 85 mg/dl. That usually means that carbohydrates and proteins are kept relatively low. Some people find the diet too restrictive and that is a deterrent for them in using this diet as a treatment plan. Some people have tried to use the dietary ketone supplements to shortcut actually maintaining a restrictive diet, but the higher carbs and proteins can interfere with the benefits. In 2021, a meta-analysis of brain disorders and the ketogenic diet was created. They were able to compare the results from 14 different observational studies about using a ketogenic diet for different mental and neurological conditions. Due to the small number of studies and the small number of participants in each study, the results were not definitive. There was, however, a positive association for the participants who were able to stay on the diet long-term. As stated above, many participants gave up the diet early on due to the restrictive nature of the plan. One of the reasons that the ketogenic diet may be helpful is the increase in GABA and glutamate production in the body. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that helps increase mood. Glutamate turns into GABA in the body. Some research has shown that the ketogenic diet can balance glutamate and GABA, helping to calm down the brain. This can be helpful for many brain-related issues. Disorders like anxiety, epilepsy, and Parkinson's, for example, all struggle with over-excitability of the brain. Another reason keto can help with mood disorders and neurological conditions is due to the blood sugar balancing. Someone who has insulin resistance has double the odds of developing major depressive disorder than an individual who does not have insulin resistance. Blood sugar dysregulation has a profound effect on the brain. A third reason has to do with mitochondrial function. In case you don’t remember from high school biology, the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Sugar consumption has a negative effect on mitochondria. Consuming sugar may decrease the effectiveness of the mitochondria. The brain requires a lot of energy to function properly, if you have ever had a mentally draining day, you may find you are hungrier at the end than if you had been physically active. That is because the brain needs so much energy. If the mitochondria are disabled, then it would mean higher levels of brain fog as well as decreasing other functions. This is a highly restrictive diet. There are people who should not attempt this method of treatment. People who struggle with disordered eating did not seem to show much improvement on the ketogenic diet alone and adding more restrictions to the diet may be triggering to individuals who struggle with already restricted eating. Individuals who struggle with fat consumption, including but not limited to those who have gallbladder concerns or have their gallbladder removed may struggle with this diet. As with any new diet change, it would be important to talk with your primary care doctor before beginning a diet like the ketogenic diet. Many videos and articles are out there discussing the ketogenic diet. Back when I was into Facebook groups, years ago, I found groups called “lazy keto” and the like. These groups and videos encourage individuals to eat imitation sugar-laden foods, high amounts of saturated fats in bacon and butter and mayonnaise, and low levels of phytochemical-rich fruits and vegetables. It is important to maintain a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for support in the gut as well as for antioxidant help with eliminating free radicals in the body. If you are going to try a ketogenic diet, make sure that you get the majority of the carbs that you are consuming from fiber-rich fruits and vegetables in order to achieve the best health benefits. This site has a list of ketogenic-friendly fruits and vegetables. There are many low-carb plant foods full of phytonutrients that are great for a ketogenic diet. If you are the kind of person who needs a premade meal plan, this site has a beginner-friendly plan for starting the ketogenic diet. "
https://medium.com/invisible-illness/migraines-made-me-who-i-am-c9710088394c?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"The first time I remember throwing up was when I was five. It wasn’t a tummy ache; I hadn’t picked up one of the innumerable bugs that seem to infest preschools (or anywhere that a group of tiny humans congregate). The bright morning light slanting through my window made my stomach lurch and heave. I still remember it — white hot and slicing right to the back of my skull. I have no idea how my mother managed it. It must have been terrifying for her to have no idea what was wrong with her child. No apparent cause, no fever or obvious illness, and no way to help. I learned early on that any movement was disastrous. I would squirm around until I could find that one cool spot on the pillow, my face pressed into it to block the light, and then lie still and unmoving like a corpse as long as I could. Any twitch or shifting would make my stomach roil. Light was the other enemy. Even in a dark room, with a pillow or cool cloth covering my eyes, I could see little flashes like sparks and even make out the slightly reddish haze inside my eyelids. I know many people who suffer from migraines today, but growing up, it wasn’t the case. I’m sure I’m not the only one to have gotten them so young. There are several studies today focusing on children with migraines, but back then, in the late 70’s, migraines were barely recognized as a thing. My doctors didn’t believe me. I was sent to a shrink when I was 8 (who was happy to chat with me but didn’t feel I was ready for therapy quite yet). As I grew older, I was often accused of drug seeking — which, to a certain extent, was true. I would have given a limb or two for something that would get rid of the pain, something traditional pain meds like ibuprofen or even morphine could not touch. In the days before triptans, all I could do was curl up in the dark and try to separate myself from the pain. Chronic, invisible illness carries with it additional burdens for the sufferer. Not only do you have to suffer through the physical pain, which is exhausting and seemingly never-ending, but you have the extra weight of disbelief that follows you around. "

Three generations of men, firmly standing together like a united front, smiling. Further to the left, I spot a small gap. And there was me. Shoulders hunched, head slightly tilted forward, an awkward smile. Why was I there again? I wondered. I have the answer to this question now: to play a role. That of the Black Sheep. You get to be part of the flock, but not quite belong to it. Coming home with a perfect, aesthetically pleasing grade list in high school was one way I’d collect rare scraps of positive affirmations in the form of a brief glance and sarcastic utterance sounding like, “How good, well done.” But we moved around a lot. And when you switch schools, you usually can’t take your grade list with you. The whole thing is wiped, and you start afresh. When this happened again, I felt defeated. All that work for nothing. Add And you have the necessary ingredients to cook up… one angry teenager. In the dysfunctional family, when not assigned other roles I didn’t ask for, I was assigned that of Rebel or Black sheep. As the oldest child, I was to blame. Whether I did wrong or not, it didn’t matter. “Shut up!”“Stupid child.”“That’s your own fault.”“No wonder you’re [insert insult here].” "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-striving-for-betterment-f8bca444f7f?source=collection_home---------0----------------------------,"“It doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll still be people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event.” That’s what Marcus Aurelius wrote when he was Emperor of Rome. For a person in power, it’s obvious to feel the heat of the enemies who’d rather have the power themselves. But you don’t have to be an emperor to have people in your life who don’t wish you the best. I also have family members who’d rather see me fail. It’s a part of life. I’ve never met a successful person who didn’t experience jealousy and hate from people close to them. The other day I was talking to a long-time friend who I’ve known since I was 15. We used to play on the same basketball team. He mentioned that he lost touch with a lot of his best friends of that era. In recent years they started to distance themselves from my friend. You know how it goes. First you don’t get invited for social gatherings, then you’re no longer welcome at birthdays, and finally there’s no contact whatsoever anymore. While this was several years ago, my friend was still upset about not seeing those guys anymore. “I really don’t get it. We were such good friends. They never said why they stopped inviting me. What’s up with that?” Well, sometimes people just have no reason. The time that friendship started to fade was when my friend got serious about his education. He changed careers several years ago, got a degree, and works as a health care professional in psychiatric care. Those guys never changed. They still have the exact same life. And they never seem happy somehow. When you have a different lifestyle than others, they think you’re weird. I experienced the exact same thing when I went to graduate school. My old drinking buddy friends and I just stopped talking to each other. In my case it was completely mutual. I strived to make my life better. And they didn’t care about betterment. I knew they didn’t wish me well. Instead of encouraging me to continue my studies, they tried to persuade me to go out clubbing instead of studying. I wasn’t interested. Ignore the people who judge you and celebrate when you fail. But no matter how nasty and jealous others can be, Marcus Aurelius warned us not to be like them: “And yet, don’t… "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-shaping-your-future-932557b1db2f?source=collection_home---------1----------------------------,"How do you feel about your life right now? Forget about everything that’s going on in the world. Look at the personal things that matter to you. For most of us, it’s our character, consistency, happiness, health, those kinds of things. The things that we have power over. Are those things better today compared to a year ago? If they aren’t better, are they at least the same? If not, I bet there’s some area in your mind that’s gnawing at you during those quiet times. Before I got on this path of continuous improvement and love of wisdom, I had many moments where I thought, “What am I doing with my life?” Not in a career or success type of way. I didn’t think about accomplishing any big goal or something like that. I often had this feeling that I wasn’t getting the most out of my mind and body. All that passive living made my life stagnant. And then I started to extrapolate my life. As Epictetus said, “There is no need to consult astrologers to predict the future.” You can simply look at your actions today and look at the common results you get. These are the only things that are within our control. That’s why worrying about things like the economy or geopolitics is fruitless. Epictetus said the overall future of the world is not something we control, and therefore it should be “nothing to us.” However, our actions should be everything to us. By changing your actions today, you can shape your tomorrow. Here’s what I did to make that change. I started to read two books a week for three years. I started to lift weights and run consistently. I started writing books and creating courses. I didn’t focus on external goals like how much money I earned or whether I had the perfect beach body. When you do things that improve yourself, it’s only a matter of time before your entire life changes. But here’s the key if you want to make a change. When you’re on your journey, 99% of the time you’ll feel like there’s no progress. You just keep going at it. You learn, work at your job, exercise, and you’ll probably feel tired at the end of the day. That’s the feeling of a good day’s work. That’s the feeling you should cherish. It’s a sign that you’re moving forward. Instead of getting frustrated because you’re not seeing any big progress from day to day, look at how you feel at the end of the day. If you can’t get to sleep because you’re worrying and feeling bad because your life is stagnant, it’s time to make a change. But when you’re in bed and you’re tired because you squeezed the most out of your day, you’re on your path of shaping your future. You’re becoming smarter, better, stronger. All the best. "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-standing-behind-your-values-at-all-times-2cffc038a6fa?source=collection_home---------2----------------------------,"Last week I went to a friend’s party. It was in a private area of an establishment, and it was a lot of fun. At some point, we were sitting outside with a group when one of the people there pulled out a joint. I don’t mind other people’s business. But I don’t like being close to people who are so addicted they can’t be at a normal party without using. If they do it in private or with others who are into that lifestyle, so be it. I simply left that space because I didn’t like the energy of that group. I could sense they were not about personal growth and positivity. So I happily left. When we decide to be a certain person with certain ideals, we can’t just throw out our ideals at the first sign of peer pressure or temptation. As Epictetus once said, we must be the same person in every situation: “Decide first what type of person you want to be and stick to it. Be the same person whether you are by yourself or with others.” This is a liberating way of living. You never have to think about how to behave in certain situations. “How should I behave at work?” Just like you behave at home or in front of your family. If you live by proper values, you have nothing to hide. I can proudly say that I’m the same person when I’m with family, friends, employees, and most importantly, when I write. This is how I think and how I live. If people think that’s too intense or serious, so what? What matters is that YOU like YOURSELF. Honestly, if people think you’re a certain way, it doesn’t matter. If the person at the party thinks I’m not fun, the feeling is mutual. I don’t have an urge to be liked by strangers or acquaintances. If I like myself, and the important people in my life like me, that’s all I need. Marcus Aurelius also talked about this idea. In his journal, he wrote that he aspired to always be honest and straightforward. If he truly lived that way, “no one can say truthfully that you are not a straightforward or honest person. That anyone who thinks that believes a falsehood. The responsibility is all yours; no one can stop you from being honest or straightforward. Simply resolve not to go on living if you aren’t. It would be contrary to the logos.” Who do you want to be? What type of person would make you proud of yourself? Be that person, always. As Marcus said, the responsibility is all yours. No one can stop you from being a certain way. All the best. "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-having-a-healthy-mind-3b25f8047014?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"In The Netherlands, where I grew up, the phrase common sense means “gezond verstand.” The literal translation to English is “healthy mind.” I’ve always liked that translation better than common sense for some reason. When I was reading Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations for the first time, I also noticed that he talked about the concept of having a healthy mind. He wrote: “A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can be seen and not say, “No! Too bright!” (which is a symptom of ophthalmia). A healthy sense of hearing or smell should be prepared for any sound or scent; a healthy stomach should have the same reaction to all foods, as a mill to what it grinds. So too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything.” That makes you think: What’s a healthy mind? Let’s start with the reverse. What’s an unhealthy mind? To think about this, we need to let go of the idea of common sense. For example, a person could have sound judgment and be a logical thinker, but still have an unhealthy mind. Here’s what an unhealthy mind means to me. A mind that’s… When you flip these things, you have a healthy mind. Can we all have a 100% healthy mind all of the time? Well, I think that’s something an unhealthy mind would ask. Think about it. A healthy mind is the opposite of worried — it’s peaceful. It doesn’t care about the things that are either outside its control or are unrealistic. The nature of human beings is that we make mistakes. We can’t live a perfect life. It’s not important whether we make mistakes or not. It’s important that we hold our composure and don’t lose our cool. Aurelius said that an unhealthy mind is one that “keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or “Everyone must approve of me.” These are just two examples of unhealthy thinking. I think most of us know what really healthy behavior is. No one is surprised when you say, “It’s… "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-the-benefits-of-annoying-things-62879e3cfd25?source=collection_home---------4----------------------------,"The Stoic Musonius Rufus believed that “the soul is strengthened as it is trained for courage by enduring hardships and trained for self-control by abstaining from pleasures.” I wonder what he would think of today’s world that is obsessed with comfort. We do everything to be more comfortable. I’m guilty of this as well. Last year I bought a heated mattress pad for cold winter nights. To me, that’s now the symbol of extreme comfort. When I read Musonius’ work, I’m reminded that hardship is good. I find it highly annoying to be cold, but enduring annoying times only strengthens you. Not in a physical way because no matter how much I expose myself to cold, I still find it annoying. I might build some tolerance, but I don’t have the same genes as Nordic people. However, enduring hardship makes my mind harder. There are many luxurious things in life I purposefully avoid. I can afford to buy a bigger house for a few years now, but I still live in the same house I bought in 2017, which is considered small by most standards. I also avoid buying exotic food and fruit every single week. Most of the time I stick to simple food. Not because I can’t afford it but because I can live well on simple food. All of this is training for life. In fact, it’s living and training at the same time. I want to avoid getting too comfortable. While I don’t care about the alleged benefits of cold showers, I sometimes shower from start to finish with cold water. All of this training gives you true comfort. When you’re accustomed to basic conditions, you will walk with a sense of calmness through life. You won’t be afraid to lose everything you have because you’re living simply anyway. Musonius explained this paradox well: “The first step in the proper training of the soul is to keep handy the proofs showing that things which seem to be good are not good and that things which seem to be bad are not bad, and to become accustomed to recognizing things that are truly good and distinguishing them from things that are not.” We’re made to believe that hardship is bad and that pleasure is good. The Stoics always challenged this idea. They flipped things around. Hardship is good. Too much pleasure is bad. Of course, life doesn’t have to be one long endurance event that’s full of hardship and deprivation. The beauty of Stoicism is that pleasure, rest, and comfort feels so much better when you do have it. I still like pleasure. And to be honest, I still like my heated pad. I just don’t use it all the time. But when I do, man, it feels good! All the best. "
https://medium.com/darius-foroux/on-being-a-friend-to-yourself-7cdd897a0fbb?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"Do you treat your friends better than you treat yourself? When a friend screws something up, you probably say, “Don’t be too hard on yourself.” But what do you say to yourself in a similar situation? Our self-talk is often much more critical than the way we would talk to a friend. I used to be like that. If I made the smallest mistake, like forgetting to close a window or something dumb like that, I would say, “This is really stupid. How can you forget to close your window? Well, say goodbye to your stuff. Someone will steal everything.” The weird thing is that we’re often relaxed in our interactions with friends or co-workers, but supercritical the closer people become to us. The way we treat others (and ourselves) looks something like this: We need to flip this whole dynamic. Let’s treat ourselves like the way we treat our friends. And let’s do the same with our loved ones. It’s something I’m constantly working on as someone who’s naturally critical. When Seneca was talking about the progress he made as a human being, he said: “What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.” Think about the importance of this concept. Seneca could’ve said anything that was related to self-improvement or Stoicism. Why didn’t he say something like, “I have begun to focus on what I control”? That would be perfectly logical because that’s the first lesson of Stoicism. I take Seneca’s answer as a sign that being a friend to yourself might be one of the most important things in life. It’s so true. Out of all the people in the world, you spend the most time with yourself. Why treat yourself as anything other than a true friend? "

I’ve heard it from many friends and colleagues. We often look at one particular thing that someone has and assume that their entire life must be so much better than ours. But how do you know for certain that life will be so much better when you acquire something? Will life be any different if you have 100K followers? I can tell you from personal experience that my life isn’t any different than five years ago. Look, things are certainly easier when you have more money, reach, or a bigger network. But those things usually come because you’ve done the work. When you leave out the people who are born into wealth or status, you see that money or recognition usually comes because a person did something. For example: We tend to focus on the rewards: The money, recognition, followers, status. But when we do this, we forget the action that leads to the rewards: Building the business; mastering the skill; rehearsing the entertainment. This is something we all know. But here’s an even more important thing. The REAL reward you acquire is not the money or status, it’s the energy, pride, and sense of accomplishment you get from performing the action.

Maybe you want to get into a top university, apply for a job at the best company in your field, or become the best expert in your area of expertise. We achieve good things when we do great work. And to do great work, we need to focus. As Seneca once said: “To be everywhere is to be nowhere.” If you want to achieve anything, you need to focus on that one thing. When your focus and energy are all over the place, you never make any meaningful progress. This idea sounds so simple, and yet it’s one of the hardest things to do in life. I can’t tell you how often I work on improving my focus. It’s an endless challenge because our focus fluctuates all the time. Here are a few things that influence your ability to focus on what’s important to you. When you take care of your mental health, work on primary activities, and have a big goal, you can make A LOT of progress in stepping up your level of focus. Sometimes, it’s best to have single-minded focus for a set amount of time. For example, during the last month, I spent about 90% of my time, energy, and mental bandwidth to completing my new book.

But somehow, our modern-day lifestyles force people to be more individualistic. It seems like many of us are too busy to spend time building deep, caring, and solid relationships with others. To me, it’s always more important to have deep relationships than a nice house, car, vacation, etc. For what use is anything in the world without the ability to share it with people you love? Seneca, someone who appreciated the importance of friendship, once said that there’s no “enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.” It seems like we sometimes forget that when we’re too busy living. But no matter how busy we are, we should always make time to maintain our important relationships. While it might seem like the people we know from school, work, sports, and nightlife are good company, they are often not our true friends. Real friends are the people we’re most inclined to take for granted. Our own partner/spouse, parents, siblings, and best friends. Those are the people who truly care about us. And those are also the people who will participate in your joy. Think about what you do when something good happens in your life? What do you usually do first? Probably call someone you can’t wait to share it with, right? Every one of these situations revolved around a shared feeling of joy. When you genuinely wish someone the world, you know that’s a good relationship. And we don’t need to have dozens of those types of relationships. If you have a few people who you know care about you, and you care about them, you’re good. When you have someone to share good times with, you also have someone to share the tough times with. "

I remember when I was in my first year of college and so many of my classmates were doubting themselves. We studied business administration, and many weren’t sure about whether the degree would be exactly what they needed. My friends would constantly look at other degrees and compare. “What if I should get a different degree?” I did none of that. Back then, I also had no clue what I wanted to do after I graduated. I knew one thing: I had made a decision and I was committed to stick with it until the end. It was just four years. I knew that I didn’t want to be in a specialized field, so I didn’t worry about whether my degree was perfect. I focused on studying, enjoying my time at college, and making sure I finished my degree within four years. Out of the people I knew who quit the degree, most became chronic quitters. One of them truly was at the wrong place. He ended up becoming a physiotherapist. Sometimes, you make the wrong plan and start going in the wrong direction, and you really do need to course-correct. We need to be self-aware enough to realize whether we want to quit because something is hard or are on the wrong path. Too often, we put too much weight on our decisions, which causes anxiety and overwhelm. The reality is that many things are not permanent. You can get a degree in business and end up working in art. You can have a job at a restaurant, and end up as an investor. Life is long. Sometimes we pursue things that don’t work out. But as long as you focus on seeing things through, you become stronger and smarter. If you do what you say, you become reliable. This is something the Stoics often talked about. To them, living according to Stoic values mattered more than what you did. How you do things is what matters. Here’s what Epictetus said: “Once you undertake to do something, stick with it and treat it as something that should be carried through. Don’t pay attention to what people say. It should not influence you in any way.” Once we set our minds to doing something, we will not only have to deal with our own inner resistance, but as Epictetus said, with what people… "

I had shades of what the internet describes as people-pleasing. Worried, I dived in and researched it. I learned people pleasing is the Fawn response — a survival response to please others at the cost (and neglect) of self, that people pleasers bend themselves backward to keep other people happy. Intuitively, their default reaction is to rush in to save the day with tips and tricks to sort out problems. They may also try to help and do the work for others. It’s exhausting and causes resentment and stress. Through my reading I came up with some ways to navigate my people-pleasing tendencies: Doing those things helped. But it was always accompanied by a nagging feeling that I was flawed and needed to be fixed. The feeling never left me. It also implied that as a people pleaser I had no backbone and was a pushover, which seemed insulting. It also seemed I didn’t know what I wanted or needed and depended on others for my ‘high’ or to feel valued. That wasn’t me. It felt wrong. "

Every now and then you have a burst of creative energy — but then it withers on the vine. On your worst days, you get down on yourself, calling yourself a diehard procrastinator, lazy. Even a loser. Trouble is, that approach does nothing to help you climb out of your creative pit. If anything, it makes it worse because it becomes a habit. And a habit of inaction just makes you miserable. What to do? Resistance comes in many sneaky disguises but it has one central aim — to keep things as they are. That might not be so bad — if you like things the way they are. But if you have bigger, bolder dreams, resistance can frustrate you to the point of misery. It can cause you to self-sabotage, procrastinate endlessly, fill your head with doubt and, finally, lose your self-respect. Author Steven Pressfield is the most widely acclaimed voice in overcoming resistance. His own story is testament to the struggle: It took him 17 years to earn any money from writing and 27 years to publish his first novel. He didn’t make a living from his writing until he was in his 50s. In his perennial bestseller War of Art, Pressfield describes resistance as that voice in your head that stops you from pursuing your dreams. The good news is that you actually have a dream — resistance doesn’t show up until you do. The more difficult news is that you have to overcome it. Because, as Pressfield says, overcoming resistance is more important than talent. Maybe you have a startup inside you? Or a novel? Maybe you want to paint or write songs? Maybe you want to start a charity or find a way to do more good in the world? Open a cafe, sell your wares online or bring a more creative approach to… "

But I never imagined that I would only be in my thirties when I lost my father. [I want to warn anyone sensitive to reading about a deceased body to use caution in reading this.] It’s a Friday morning in August 2021. Just after 6:00 am, I wake to my mom’s screams. I jump out of bed, run to my parents’ room, find my mother in her bathroom, bent over my father’s body on the floor. She’s screaming, “He’s dead! Oh my god! He’s dead!” I hear the screaming, I can’t comprehend her words. I call 911. I explain; the dispatcher explains that we need to try to perform CPR. As I sob, I try to perform chest compressions as my mom she is giving him mouth-to-mouth. But it’s too late. My dad died August 20, 2021, from a natural, unknown cause. After he passed away, all I could do was grieve and reflect on what my dad — and his death — taught me. Here are the five lessons I hold close. After my dad died, all I could think about was how much I hoped he reached a point where he was proud of his legacy. This concept was important to him. And, so, finding my purpose has become important to me. I have decided to pursue my passion for helping children, and knowing that life can end so suddenly, I want to commit to following a career that makes me feel happy and fulfilled. I have also decided to enter a Ph.D. program, as this is a step toward future goals. I truly believe that my purpose is to help youth, and I plan to open a non-profit where I can support young people mentally, emotionally, and academically. I noticed a shift in my mental and emotional well-being after my dad died. For context, I live with my parents, so when my dad passed at home, my mom and I were… "
https://medium.com/on-the-couch/4-proven-strategies-for-strengthening-your-self-esteem-f2678297127c?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"During my high school years in West Africa, I was surrounded by tens of classmates who were “super-intelligent”, came from wealthy homes, and whose parents were in academia. I came from a family that was contrary to theirs and coupled with the steady bullying I received from them, I was intimidated, felt inferior, and simply felt it was natural to have them lead the class. This was a toxic environment for me. It killed my self-esteem, and I felt I was good for nothing. I performed badly; they all did better than me. I got into another group of students who were also intelligent but treated me fairly. This made me feel a little more important. It marked a new beginning for me. Your environment serves as a great tool for building you. Being aware of your environment is a crucial step in building your self-esteem. I had a better perception of myself and had great confidence in myself when my environment changed—in this case, a change in the group of classmates I had. My academic performance improved afterwards, helping my self-esteem level up significantly. Are you around people who don’t celebrate you, undermine your worth, or push you to accomplish seemingly giant tasks? Take note, because an environment like this can influence you negatively. You may forever feel inferior, meaning your true potential won’t be reached. According to Stephen Richards, author of “Boost Your Self-Esteem”: When you look in the mirror, who stares back? That image is more than just a physical representation—it reflects our perception of ourselves, influencing our confidence, decisions, and overall well-being. Our self-esteem is intricately tied to how we perceive ourselves. If the reflection in our mental mirror is distorted by self-doubt, criticism, or negative beliefs, it can hinder personal growth, well-being and potential. Conversely, a positive self-perception levels up your confidence, resilience, and sense of fulfillment. In addition, your view of yourself will influence the way others treat you — so it’s important to begin the journey within. As humans, there is often the desire to skip steps and achieve big goals quickly. But completing small tasks works like a propeller. It fuels us, giving us the motivation to carry on to the next task. On the other hand, when huge, complex goals are tackled first, it may prime you for failure. And that kills not just your drive and motivation but also your self-esteem. It may even make you feel unworthy of achieving simpler goals. As you tick off small, simple goals, your confidence level rises and, with it, your self-esteem. Seek to accomplish small tasks first, then gradually move on to more complex ones. This way, you build the stamina you need to sustain you in chasing more complex goals. Proper reflection on our progress is underrated. We often don’t give enough importance or attention to thoroughly and thoughtfully assessing our growth, achievements, and development over time. Train yourself to notice the things you have already done, the changes and progress you have made towards building your self-esteem. Celebrate when you respond to situations in new, healthy ways — contrary to the way you’ve done things in the past. Appreciate yourself and be grateful; you’re getting better! Building your self-esteem is a gradual process that requires self-awareness, self-acceptance, and continuous effort. Be patient, and be sensitive to your environment. The path to a healthier self-image is within reach for everyone. So begin your journey today. Thank you for reading!

https://medium.com/on-the-couch/finally-a-morning-routine-you-will-actually-look-forward-to-c1cd37a18d6c?source=collection_home---------4----------------------------,"The way you start your day shapes your lifetime. Those first 60 minutes, the cup of coffee you savour, the activities you engage in, the people you interact with, set the tone for the day ahead. If rigid morning routines aren’t your cup of tea, consider a Morning Flow Routine — a flexible approach that evolves with you each morning. Interested? Read on. “Morning flow” is a term used for light movement to bring energy and space into the body. It’s flexible, in that it evolves to your changing energy levels. It is about getting into a flow and doing things that you genuinely want to do that day. You’ll be fulfilling your responsibilities, like packing lunch or going to work, but you will still feel in control of your day. So how do we do it? Let’s start by ditching the idea of a “perfect morning routine” which does not take into account your mood or energy, and can feel rigid and monotonous. Here’s what I mean: Pretty straightforward, right? Now let’s back up for a minute and think about it: If you look closely, Melissa is forcing a one-size-fits-all morning routine on herself. Some days it will work for her, other days it won’t. She needs flexibility. Her morning routine should revolve around what her body needs that day. It’s can be simple as: Think of your morning routine as a personal therapy session. Ask yourself: Is it a warm bath day, or do I need some skincare to feel good? Do I need vigorous exercise or a few long, slow stretches? Start by listing what lights your morning fire. Your list should include No Energy, Low Energy, and Medium-High Energy activities. Here’s a guide to help you create a personalised list: Pay close attention to your body and mind signals. If you don’t want to do any physical activity that day, don’t. Make a list of your low energy and high energy activities so you can avoid decision fatigue in the morning. It is important to remember that your goal is to uplift your mood — not lower it or stress yourself out. On high energy mornings, you might choose to engage with your loved ones and even have a quick chat with someone. One study showed that participants who smiled, made eye contact, and chatted with the cashier when buying their coffee had improved moods after the interaction, compared with those who didn’t interact beyond necessity. But there will be days when you don’t want to talk to anyone. On those mornings, try to engage with yourself and focus on everything going on in your mind. Understanding your feelings will make it easier to process your emotions and express them in the right way. Here’s where the magic happens — mix and match those activities. Think of your routine like a personal mixtape, play whatever works for you. Had a stressful week with difficult mornings? You don’t have to clean the house first thing in the morning (unless you enjoy it). Maybe have a leisurely coffee with the cat on your knee instead. When you feel in control of your day, chores won’t feel like a burden. Take a moment to reflect: what moments made you feel good? Be open to tweaking things as you go and finding the right flow to your mornings. Your routine should grow and change with you. Most importantly, enjoy the journey. Finding your morning flow should be an adventure, not another chore. Let it be a dynamic, ever-changing part of your day. Thank you for reading!

https://medium.com/on-the-couch/the-love-language-that-will-screw-you-over-how-to-manage-it-c3bce4389582?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"Everyone’s heard of the five love languages. Okay maybe not everyone, but I reckon it’s close. Almost everyone in therapy to work on their relationship issues can name their primary “language”. This simple classification was the brainchild of Dr Gary Chapman who wrote the classic book The Five Love Languages 30 years ago. He outlined five key ways we communicate with our partners. Quality time. Words of affirmation. Acts of Service. Physical Touch. Receiving Gifts. And readers loved it (and still do), primarily because it offers a solution to an age-old quest: to know how we love, and want to be loved. But those five love languages are not what we talk about in therapy. Nope, we talk much more about the other — extremely common — language that gets in the way of love. We talk about fear. Fear underpins many relationship struggles. Obviously being with a toxic partner ignites fear, so does having your trust broken by the one you’re with. But so do the fears we bring into our relationships, those embedded in us from a difficult “love history.” I worked with a woman whose five-year marriage had just broken up. She was struggling with two of the most common fears in love — abandonment and rejection. She had a painful history of loss — the death of loved family members but also betrayal in her relationships — and it had left her hypersensitive in love. She had developed a pattern of getting close to someone then pulling back, finding ways to critique her partner or pick the relationship apart before she could be rejected. She’d lost some potentially good partners along the way. “I’m aware of what I’m doing,” she said, “but it’s almost like if I’m going to be dumped I want it to be because of the way I behaved rather than who I am.” Ouch. You can see why love was both difficult and painful for her — and why her best intentions ended unhappily. "
https://medium.com/on-the-couch/the-highly-ambitious-persons-guide-to-happiness-bc6637a98deb?source=collection_home---------6----------------------------,"Do you love the thrill of the chase? Do you feel at your best — most alive — when you’re going hard after your goals? Fair play. There’s nothing wrong with being powered by a strong desire and determination to succeed. Actually, there’s a lot right with it. Trouble is, it can be hard for ambitious people to be happy and content, primarily because they live in “stretch” mode. No sooner have they smashed one goal, they’re onto the next. Then the next, then the next. But even as they climb the ladder they wonder: why doesn’t this feel as good as I expected? Why don’t I feel happy? A client once told me mathematics was the key to life. He lent me a maths book to explain. It didn’t make me love it, not in the way he did, but it intrigued me in a way maths never had before. What we agreed on was that equations are universally helpful because they bring precision to the abstract. They give us a means of solving real life problems. Now, I’d be in trouble if I tried to apply equations to my clients’ problems. People are not easily quantified, measured or compared — nor is mental illness. Even the official Diagnostic Manuals of Psychiatric Disorder are only a guide to figuring out all of what’s going on for someone. But — still — science and data underpin what psychologists do. It gives us a solid foundation for trying to understand the human condition. It gives names to things that are hard to name. It offers a springboard into a world that can be, at times, hard to fathom. Obviously happiness, like all feelings, can’t be quantified absolutely — although many have tried through scales, checklists and self-reports (including me!) But when working with my clients there’s one equation I have always kept an eye on because it’s a simple, reliable measure of a person’s satisfaction with their life. It’s this: "
https://medium.com/on-the-couch/7-life-changing-lessons-i-learned-from-failure-ac20571b499a?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"Damn! I failed again! “What’s your problem, Nnamdi?” “Will you continue this way?” “You’re intelligent, but I really can’t tell why you keep failing.” “It’s time we thought of something else you can be good at. We can’t keep making huge sacrifices without seeing good results for our investments.” My parents were fed up with trying to support me financially through high school. I understood their pain, but I couldn’t seem to do anything about it. Academically, I struggled to finish high school and needed to move on to the next phase—university. But when I sat for the entrance exams during my last year in high school, I failed badly. I waited for the next year to go for them again. It wasn’t any better after the second trial. I did this five more times and had nature smile at me on my eighth trial. Years later, I began to recognize the profound transformation those experiences had brought about in me. For every failed attempt I made, something happened to me! Perhaps the most transformative lesson of all was the realization that failure is not a dead end but a stepping stone. Every attempt I made served as a stepping stone and gradually propelled me to achieve my dream of making it to university. It’s okay to stumble and fall; what truly matters is our ability to get back up and continue our journey with newfound wisdom and determination. Each failed attempt was not the end of a dream but the beginning of a new and improved one. During challenging times, I learned to lean on the support of others. After two attempts, I ran to friends and colleagues for proper guidance. This helped me to achieve my goals faster. Seeking help and advice from mentors, friends, or family members is not a sign of weakness but a testament to our humility and willingness to learn. I discovered the beauty in imperfections. I realized that I make mistakes and fail because I’m human. As Alexander Pope puts it: “To err is human…” I only fail because I’m not well-equipped with the right knowledge and resources. To beat this, I roll up my sleeves and work to have these in my possession. Through each trial, I discovered the incredible power of resilience. Before this series of failures, I knew how impatient I could be when I made attempts to achieve personal goals, especially when there was no external pressure, such as that from my parents. I simply let go after one or two failed attempts. These exams were inevitable. My parents' eyes were heavily on me, and I needed to clear off the shame on my face by joining my friends at the university. I was under pressure to get it right! After this season of failure, I paid attention to how patient I’ve become in achieving personal goals. I stayed up for any goal until it was achieved, and I understood that setbacks are not the end of the road but a detour on the path to success. Every failure I experienced served as an opportunity to become more resilient, and my resilience grew as I went. The ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep moving forward is a skill that can be honed and developed. Life is unpredictable, and my attempts highlighted the significance of adaptability. I realized I’m most efficient in the mornings. I resolved to study more in the mornings. This strategy helped me have a better understanding of concepts and also gave me more time to study each day. I applied this routine throughout my days at the university, and it helped me perform to my best. Being open to change and willing to adjust my approach was crucial to navigating hurdles. Flexibility became my secret weapon. When things didn’t go as planned, I discovered that failure can fuel creativity. It encouraged me to think outside the box, innovate, and explore new possibilities. I changed strategies and sought new ways of going about my studies, and I discovered what worked best for me. For example, after the fifth attempt, I thought of working with past questions from the previous sets. This gave me proper guidance during my studies. I realized I had never been working smart. It’s through setbacks that some of the most remarkable innovations have emerged. My mother played a significant role throughout the series of failures I experienced. She encouraged me, giving me confidence in myself. Surrounding oneself with a strong support system of friends, family, and mentors provides invaluable guidance and encouragement during tough times. My trials showed me the significance of a dependable network. My failures have provided invaluable lessons. While it’s human to fear failure, these experiences have taught me to embrace it as a catalyst for growth and learning. Each setback, every missed mark, has propelled me closer to success. Through resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering belief in the process, I’ve come to understand success often springs from the fertile ground of failure. As you embark on your ventures and face inevitable setbacks, remember these five lessons: learn, persevere, adapt, keep your passion burning, and never underestimate the transformative power of failure.

https://medium.com/on-the-couch/how-to-tell-youve-emotionally-quit-your-relationship-821c5af61b9f?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"You’re out — except you’re not. You feel like you’ve run your race in your relationship. But — officially — you’re still together. From the outside, things look pretty normal. But, inside the relationship, there’s trouble. You know it, your partner senses it — and tension between you simmers. Maybe you’re in separate beds, or rooms; maybe it’s just a feeling you’ve lost your connection. And you’ve lost faith in your ability to get it back. I’ve had lots of clients land in this place. Sometimes they come to therapy as individuals, feeling sad, trying to sort the confusion in their heads. Sometimes, they come as a couple but it quickly becomes clear they have quite different agendas. One of them wants out. As one client confessed: “In my head I left the relationship a year ago, but I haven’t got the courage to own it. Moving out seems so final.” This man described a toxic dynamic between him and his partner. Constant niggles that often turned to nasty arguments. Yelling. Silences. Name-calling. Passive-aggressive behaviour. Uneasy truces. He accepted that they were both responsible for the toxicity. “I wish it was as easy as labelling her a narcissist — it’s not. I’m just as bad.” “We just don’t connect anymore, over anything. We’re both in the house physically but emotionally I think I’ve let it go. And it’s showing up in my behaviour at home. I’m not the person I used to be.” When applied to love, emotional quitting refers to a person “giving up” on the relationship due to the way they’ve come to feel about it. The decision is often driven by strong emotions, such as frustration, anger, sadness, or disappointment, rather than a rational or logical assessment of the situation. That’s understandable, if it’s toxic or abusive. But, often, the emotional disconnect is more stealthy than that. When you unpack it, there’s often a history of discontent and something — perhaps interest in another person — causes it… "
https://medium.com/on-the-couch/hands-down-the-most-unsettling-discovery-of-your-life-d5346c92bdb7?source=collection_home---------9----------------------------,"“I’m spoilt for options,” my client said. We were discussing the place she’d found herself in — smack in the angst of midlife; flat, bored, struggling to feel excited over anything. Like many, she felt guilty for even raising this in therapy. It felt indulgent when so many people around the world were dealing with much, much more — war, poverty, homelessness, the death of their loved ones. Her problem was that she didn’t know in which direction to angle her life. She was torn between a lust for adventure and the comfort and stability of playing it “safe”. It sounds like a simple decision if you long for excitement — take the unknown path. But, as anyone who’s found themselves here knows, it’s not as easy as ditching the comfort zone for the wild blue yonder. There are usually many other things to consider — money, family security, elderly parents, the happiness of your kids. But it’s a tough place to be. Being caught in this trap leads to a sort of paralysis. And inaction almost always equals misery. Blame the memes. Or your parents, if you like. Or the entire self-help movement. But, whoever’s responsible, being set up with the belief that “you can do anything, be anyone you want to be” is unhelpful. They might even have screwed you over. Because you can’t be anyone or anything you want to be. And the older you get, the more you become aware of it. The more you wake up to the finality of life; that you, all of us, are on deadline. And it’s the worst kind of deadline because we can’t slap a date on it. As young people, most of us have no clue which career, or even life, path to take. So we follow the dreams of our parents. Or their dreams for us. Or the dreams of society. Or the dreams of wildly rich but quite unlikeable people. Or the dreams of good-looking people we don’t know on social media. And those choices can take us down some paths that are completely at… "

But the truth is, it goes much deeper than that. It’s an intricate maze of emotions and vulnerabilities that can hold us back from living our fullest, most authentic lives. This fear isn’t something that you can just sweep under the rug and hope it disappears. Rather, it requires understanding, patience, and a willingness to confront the hidden layers of our inner selves. We all feel the fear of being seen at some point in our lives. It’s that gnawing sense of unease, the butterflies in your stomach, or the voice in your head whispering; It can manifest in a variety of situations, from speaking in public to sharing your thoughts and feelings with others. But it’s crucial to realize that this fear isn’t merely about being unsure of yourself; it’s about the deep-rooted insecurities, judgments, and expectations that we carry within us. To conquer the fear of being seen, we must first understand its complex roots. This fear often begins to take shape in childhood. We’re taught to conform, to be like everyone else, and to avoid standing out. While these lessons may serve to maintain order and social harmony, they can also stifle our individuality and authenticity. Over time, the fear of being seen becomes a protective mechanism. It’s a defense against the possibility of rejection or judgment from others. Another critical factor that contributes to this is the constant comparison in today’s world. Social media, for instance, bombards us with carefully curated images and stories of seemingly perfect lives and accomplished people faulting their skills. This can intensify the fear of being seen, as we become increasingly concerned about measuring up to these unrealistic standards. Overcoming the fear of being seen requires self-reflection. It’s about getting in touch with your inner self and… "

I came across it and it felt timely to share it now. “I’d like to talk to you about healing, specifically about why you go through it and the benefits of it. In the incarnated sense, healing means anything from mending a broken arm to mending a broken heart. Both can seem catastrophic in their own ways as you move through the experience of healing them. Some days you feel angry, others you feel hopeless. Now, what do you suppose the experience is on the soul level? First, it’s important to know that you choose such a healing event. Some of you know this but others are still awakening and may not fully comprehend what this means. The events in your lives are planned, the family you are born to, the relationships, friendships, jobs, and health events are all planned by you prior to your birth.” “Your life purpose and lessons are interwoven throughout life events healing and otherwise to help you achieve the goals of your soul for this lifetime. Often these are plans that began in different lifetimes and you are carrying over, finishing up in this lifetime. Other times they are new events that you wish to experience now. Either way, they are there for your benefit, to grow, and learn as you experience them. When you have suffered some type of emotional event, heartbreak, grief, or upset of any kind it is important to allow for this pain to be. Accepting it and not suppressing it, makes it fluid, it can move through you and eventually heal. Going through physical pain reflects some type of emotional pain that has not been allowed to move through your system. "

Everything that you are experiencing is a projection of the mind. Most humans live in the 3rd dimension, surrounded by pollution, chaos, devastation, and fear. Because of the destruction of Planet Earth 3.0, there was concern (the experiment) would be destroyed. So, we decided to do an upgrade to Planet Earth 5.0.

You do the following before entering into this experience. Every day, more humans discover what I am sharing with you today. Some participants (like myself) speak openly about the simulation because it is a part of our soul contract. Most of us have already completed the experiment but were selected (or decided) to reenter to assist with the upgrade to the New Earth. Most of those assisting with the ascension are Starseed Lightworkers from other planets. These Starseeds are helping because this upgrade is massive, and nothing like this has ever occurred. Additionally, most Starseeds have abilities (like healing) that are essential for the ascension.

The Celts, who lived over 2,000 years ago in areas like Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France, marked their new year on November 1. This day signified the end of summer and harvest and the start of the cold, dark winter, often associated with death. They believed that on the night before the new year (October 31), the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred, and the ghosts of the deceased returned to Earth. To honor this event, the Celts held celebrations called Samhain, during which they believed that the presence of these otherworldly spirits allowed Celtic priests, known as Druids, to predict the future. These predictions provided comfort during the long winter months. They lit large sacred bonfires, where people gathered to burn crops and animals as offerings to Celtic gods. People wore costumes, typically made of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other’s fortunes. After the celebration, they rekindled their hearth fires from the sacred bonfire for protection during winter. The Romans, after conquering Celtic territories around A.D. 43, combined their own festivals with Samhain. Two Roman festivals, Feralia (honoring the dead) and Pomona (honoring the goddess of fruit and trees, symbolized by apples), blended with Samhain. This blending may explain the tradition of bobbing for apples on Halloween. In A.D. 609, Pope Boniface IV dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to Christian martyrs, establishing All Martyrs Day. Pope Gregory III expanded it to include all saints and moved the observance to November 1. "

You can be in the process of self-improvement right now and wondering if you’re making any real progress, or you might look back on your life and notice a pattern of growth. I’m going to share with you 10 signs that you’re quickly evolving into your best self. Maybe you’re more familiar with these signs than you believe.. In the past, change might have been unsettling, a disruptive force in your comfort zone. But now, you see it in a different light. You’ve realized that change is not only inevitable but a crucial part of personal growth. If you find yourself welcoming change rather than shying away from it, it’s a clear signal of your evolution. You’re not only prepared to face new challenges but eager to learn and grow from them. Embracing change opens the door to fresh opportunities, experiences, and wisdom that will ultimately shape the best version of you. This shift in perspective doesn’t happen overnight though; it develops through time as a result of maturity and self-awareness brought on by the realization that life is a series of changing circumstances. The second sign of your self-improvement journey is your newfound grasp of boundaries, both your own and those of others. In the past, perhaps you allowed others to overstep your boundaries or crossed lines unknowingly. Now, you’re different. You not only know what your boundaries are but you’re also more assertive in upholding them. Simultaneously, you’re more respectful of other people’s boundaries. You acknowledge that, like you, others deserve their own space, time, and energy. This awareness and respect signify emotional maturity and self-respect, reflecting your commitment to maintaining healthy relationships. "

When faced with difficult decisions we are encouraged to “go with our gut” or “follow our heart”. There is a base assumption that there is some wisdom in how we feel that gives us instruction on how to live our best lives and become our best selves. And yet, in the world of psychotherapy, it seems as though a great many individuals struggle with their emotions. Emotions become symptoms whose instructions lead to self-sabotaging, destructive, and painful consequences. Depression convinces us that there is little to no hope and that our efforts at trying will end in failure. Anxiety pleads with us to prepare for the worst or to avoid the worst-case scenarios that feel inevitable. If anything, the hallmark of poor mental health is that our emotions betray us. We feel sad, fearful, or upset even when nothing seems wrong. We feel unsatisfied in spite of everything seemingly going well. “Nothing’s wrong.” My client remarks, “I just wonder if I’ll ever be happy. Everything is fine, I mean, everything on paper is just fine. I have friends and a good job. But I think something’s wrong that I can’t just be happy.” But that’s just people with mental health issues, right? Surely, someone who has good mental health should be able to trust their emotions? The long story short is this; our emotions are projective and prediction-based. When we are navigating the world, much of our emotional experience is one of anticipation. At any given time you might ask yourself, Your feelings and emotions will oftentimes be a direct reflection of how you answer this question. If you imagine that something exciting, enjoyable, and pleasant is coming next, then you will feel a sense of excitement, joy, and positive anticipation. This typically gives people energy, or at the very least, inspires relief and hope. If you imagine that something awful will happen; that things are bound to go poorly… "

So if your goal is to have a healthier mind, you have to start by removing all the junk from your diet. You and your mental health are more important than your career, more money than other people’s opinions, that event you said you would attend, your partner’s mood and your family’s wishes.

You can enjoy the four walls and falsely think you have kept the people at bay. But as soon as some harsh weather comes, you know your reality. The house provides no protection. Similarly, spiritual knowledge is hollow if it does not lead to peace during harsh times. Peace occurs when one gains experiential wisdom, not some theoretical stuff. Every spiritual seeker starts by reading spiritual stuff. I also began by reading books written by masters. But it can not help after a certain point. To know yourself more deeply, you must let go of the knowledge you cling to. As you progress, your requirement differs. A toddler who starts to walk requires a walker. However, after a point, that same walker hinders their jumping and running. For a beginner, the wisdom of sages appears attractive. The enigma surrounding it seems mystical. The mind wants to know more and more. But as you progress, the same knowledge disturbs you. The repetition of similar words frustrates you when you lack experience. When I was seeking more, my heart could not take any more concepts. It all appeared hollow. What was the use of words like nirvana or enlightenment when I didn’t even understand them? I was lucky to distance myself from useless theoretical knowledge. It was not so difficult for me as I was embracing life (as it was) instinctively. Even when I was suicidal, I didn’t run away from my utter helplessness. I chose to remain true to my misery till it dissolved naturally. I thought the journey must be similar for everyone. But I was so wrong. Over the past few years, I’ve met so many people who tightly clutch the beliefs they have read. Some have even created their own concepts with the limited knowledge they have. "

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

However, over time it has stretched it’s definition to include statements which we repeat to help us focus on something positive. That’s the kind of mantra I’m talking about. Repeating a mantra throughout your day can help us soothe our emotions, while making a powerful statement to the Universe. So Here It Is Focussing your mind on a mantra, or statement accomplishes a few things. You expected something like this to happen, so much so that you labelled it “Typical”. Just imagine what will happen if you expect great things to happen for you today! 2. You soothe your mind and raise your vibrations. This second part is what aids the first part. The Universe can’t send you what you expect unless you are an active participant in the process. Raise your thoughts and vibrations to those of great things and what the Universe has already delivered to you, will be accessible to you! Say it as early in the day as possible. Start the day off right. Like a healthy breakfast, feed your mind healthy thoughts. Write it down! Look at it regularly to remind yourself. Put in your digital calendar so that it pops up throught the day. Share your mantra with others who are interested. Don’t force it on anyone who isn’t — it’ll never work and you’ll just get frustrated, the opposite of what you want to happen. But sharing with others who are interested, spreads the good vibes. "

Too many people seem to use money in ways that create problems, stress, and headaches. Money can be a wonderful tool, but only if you use it to simplify your life (not complicate it). Stop making unforced errors. Spend to simplify. Life definitely isn't fair. It's a troubling reality. But instead of wasting energy on every obstacle in your way, focus on what you can control and how you can break through. Stop looking out. Look in. Be accountable. Own your shit. In his 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech, Steve Jobs talked about having faith that the dots will somehow connect in your life. You take daily actions with complete uncertainty. Faith in the dots allows you to persevere and endure the uncertainty. Your 80-year-old self cares about the long-term compounding of the decisions of today. Your 10-year-old self reminds you to stay foolish and have some fun along the way. If you have the good fortune to be wealthy and successful in life, always be sure to share it with others.

When faced with something challenging or stressful, they tend to throw up resistance. It’s almost like dealing with a stubborn, spoiled child. When things get tough, that inner child awakens, and suddenly, the procrastination monster rears its head. Imagine your brain as that child who complains and throws a tantrum when things don’t go their way. The same happens when you’re faced with difficult tasks — your mind starts to procrastinate, making it even harder to take action. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Mindset plays a pivotal role in conquering these challenges. Let me share a real-life example with you. One of my Friends During his medical school clinical rotations, had to step out of my comfort zone often. Giving lectures, performing procedures, and breaking tough news to families were no easy feats. I had a friend who seemed to take it all in stride, unbothered by mistakes or setbacks. Curious about her secret, I asked her how she managed it. And you know what she said? She wasn’t even thinking about stepping out of her comfort zone. For her, it was all about having fun and immersing herself in the learning process, treating it like a game. Isn’t that fascinating? By taking the pressure off her ego and simply enjoying the tasks, she managed to push through the resistance and excel in her endeavors. Your brain is wired to protect you, just like a parent looking out for their child. When stress or difficulty comes knocking, your brain’s automatic reaction is to resist, to avoid discomfort. But here’s the thing: Understanding this response is the first step towards embracing that “spoiled child” within you. Instead of fighting it, let’s figure out how to work together with your brain. One fantastic strategy to outsmart your brain is the “Two-Minute Rule.” Imagine facing a daunting task, and the thought of diving into it feels overwhelming. Instead of putting intense pressure on yourself to complete the whole thing at once, lower the barrier to entry. Tell yourself, “Hey, I’m just going to spend two minutes on this.” Bold move, right? Those two minutes will feel like a piece of cake. And you know what? More often than not, once you start, you’ll find yourself surprisingly motivated to keep going. Now, let’s take it to the next level. Breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps is key. Picture this: you need to tackle a big project that seems like a mountain to climb. Your brain instantly panics, imagining the sheer effort required. But wait! Take a deep breath and break it down into bite-sized pieces. Divide and conquer, my friend! Start by outlining the first step, then the second, and so on. Suddenly, that overwhelming mountain turns into a series of smaller hills you can easily conquer. This will only be possible if you are consistent thought, if you keep piling up everything then I guess you need a different strategy. That little voice inside your head shapes how you see yourself and what you believe you’re capable of. But here’s the thing: your ego can either be your biggest cheerleader or your toughest critic when it comes to tackling challenges. Well, your ego’s job is to protect your self-image, and how you see yourself. So, when faced with something that feels outside your comfort zone, it might resist, not wanting to risk any “damage” to that self-image. Here’s a little trick to tame that ego and make it your ally: change the way you talk to yourself. Language is a powerful tool, my friend! Instead of saying, “I need to do this,” try this on for size: “I am someone who does this.” Bold move, right? By aligning your actions with your identity, you create harmony between what you do and how you perceive yourself. So, next time you face a tough task, tell yourself, “I am someone who tackles challenges head-on!” Your ego will be nodding in approval. When you consistently act in ways that align with your desired self-image, something magical happens. Your ego starts to notice, and it’s like, “Hey, this is who we are!” Let me share a personal example: When I started hitting the gym regularly, I had this vision of being a fit and healthy person. So, every time I worked out, I reminded myself, “I am someone who prioritizes fitness.” And guess what? Over time, my self-image transformed. Do you know what makes tackling those challenging tasks even more exciting? Rewarding yourself along the way! That’s right — using the power of positive reinforcement can be a game-changer when it comes to boosting your motivation and making hard work feel like a breeze. Knowing that once you’re done, there’s a delightful reward waiting for you — a delicious treat, a movie night, or maybe some well-deserved me-time. Positive reinforcement is like a pat on the back from your own cheer squad. It tells your brain, “Hey, you’re doing a great job!” And that’s all it takes to keep that motivation engine running full speed ahead. But this needs discipline. Okay, here’s the secret sauce: pairing hard work with enjoyable activities. Think of it as a balanced meal for your brain. When you have something to look forward to after conquering a challenging task, it feels like a fun game, not a burden. Let’s get real with a relatable example: Imagine you’ve got a demanding work deadline. Instead of just stressing over it, create a plan. Tell yourself, “If I finish this task, I’ll treat myself to a little dance party or a short walk in the park.” Remember, it’s not about having everything figured out from the start. It’s about taking one step at a time, learning along the way, and embracing the journey. Every small improvement is a victory, and those add up to something remarkable. You only have to become closer to 1% better each time. Consistency is the key to turning your goals into reality. It’s like watering a plant every day to watch it grow. So, create a routine that aligns with your goals and stick to it like glue. Here’s a personal example: When I wanted to improve my writing skills, I committed to writing for at least 30 minutes every morning. At first, it was tough, but the more I stuck to my routine, the easier it became. Before I knew it, writing became second nature, and my skills soared. Surround yourself with people and resources that lift you up. A supportive environment can make all the difference in your journey. If you want to eat healthier, keep your kitchen stocked with nutritious options. If you aim to exercise regularly, join a fitness class with like-minded individuals. Your environment can be your greatest cheerleader. But again it all boils down to one thing, and that is staying Disciplined. Without this, you only have the raw brain power and no plan to follow. Also if you really hate what you are currently doing, then this entire piece of text is worthless. Anyways, Thanks for taking the time to read this article!

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

Before I start, I’d say it’s a good question, but also an irrelevant one. Everyone has their own life challenges. Unique soul wounds that they must learn to heal. The philosophy that helped me the most could have no impact on anyone else. That’s why this question bothers me. Because I could build an entire blogpost that wouldn’t serve much purpose. So I’m going to choose three philosophies instead of one. It might broaden your horizons depending on the issues you’re dealing with. I love Stoicism. But not a fan of what Stoicism has become. In this day and age, statues have taken over internet. Entire blogs/channels and brands are built around these old writings. I like the fact that this philosophy is being brought to light. I don’t like the fact that shortcuts are being made about it. Some people describe a stoic as someone who doesn’t feel. As if feelings had left his body. That he’s just a brain without a heart. A being made of flesh but without the feelings that make us human. This vision of stoicism is reductive and incomplete. To enter this stoic universe. Marc Aurele’s Meditations are a magnificent read. This is a man who writes his own thoughts. Without ever thinking that one day, they will be published. We have access to pure, authentic, intimate reflections. From a man who has taken the time to meditate on his life, his desires, his existence. Who questions his moral alignment. How to be a good man. How to live a dignified life. How never to betray yourself. How to live a good life. For the other great Stoics. I don’t read Seneca. He has some quotations critical of wealth while he himself accumulated massive amounts of it. I can’t read those who are not in line with their word. For Epictetus, I’ll elaborate in a future content. I’ll need a whole article to explain my position on his thinking. Why do men who have renounced all social rules fascinate me? I’ve no idea. If you open my e-mails or read my content. I'm sure that many of you hate rules, power games between humans, the hypocrisy of society, the constant lies, the mask we have to wear at all times in order to survive. The media. Politics. All these layers of hypocrisy to keep a machine running that doesn’t give a damn about us. Worse, it takes advantage of those who support it. The injustice of this world makes you uncomfortable. You wonder why this world doesn’t run right? Why so much suffering? We could build a paradise. Some do everything to make it a hell. I’m sure many of you feel that way or you wouldn’t read my content. I found resistance in Diogenes and Thoreau. The refusal of all those idiotic societal rules that we follow because they are only collective beliefs. They symbolize courage. To say no to madness. To run away. To refuse to live a life that society wishes to impose on them. But more than just refusing. To proclaim loud and clear that others are wrong. Not just to rebel in their own corners. To say what they think. To act the way they want. Not just to say the words, but to live them. They will pay the ultimate price: mockery and marginalization. One by living in a barrel. The other by isolating himself from the mundane. I have a deep admiration for those who are brave enough to live their words. When I discovered an undefeated samurai. Who spent his life fighting. Living it his way. Free. It was a revelation. I devoured everything I could find on the legendary ronin. What I like about Musashi is that his philosophy is made up of simple words. There’s nothing to hide behind a myriad of complexities. It’s only associations of a few words. Clear. Some quotes from Gorin-No-Sho: The Book of Five rings. The book is peppered with little phrases full of wisdom. He also left Dokkodo, The Path of Aloneness. It consists of 21 precepts written a week before he died. Short sentences with heavy meaning. “Accept everything just the way it is.”“Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.”“Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.” “Do not regret what you have done.”This cryptic phrase took me a long time to understand.It helped me overcome the guilt I couldn’t shake off. “Never be jealous.”Freeing yourself from envy. “Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.”Easy to say, harder to do. “Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.”Practical minimalism. Don’t get caught up in the consumer society. “You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honor.”You can live without a lot of things. You can’t live without honor. “Never stray from the Way.” My favourite. It’s my phone wallpaper. It’s on my fridge. A reminder never to stray from the path you want to reach. If you want to dive into Musashi’s life. There’s a lot of good reads. Many anecdotes. The famous duel with Sasaki Kojiro. His last years. His death. The transmission of his philosophy. Every stage of his life is full of little bits of wisdom you can use. This article is coming to an end. These were the three philosophies that inspire me most. If I had to add honorable mentions. This philosophy of the present reminds me of those monks in some lost dojo. At mealtime. Not a word was to be spoken. The meal was taken as a group. But talking is forbidden. If you have any questions. As usual, feel free. Thank you for reading. Have a great Sunday. Take care. If you love philosophy, I have a newsletter.I explore philosophical concept to live a better life. Join 1344 friends in The World Within. "

It’s the bridge between aspirations and accomplishments, the driving force that propels us towards our dreams. In this article, we’ll explore how self-discipline can be cultivated and utilized to unlock your fullest potential. We’ll delve into practical strategies, real-life examples, and the science behind self-discipline to provide you with an insightful guide on harnessing this vital skill. Self-discipline involves the ability to focus on a task or goal, resisting short-term temptations in favor of long-term gains. It’s about having the mental strength to stay consistent in your efforts, even when the going gets tough. Psychologists often view self-discipline as a learned behavior, rather than an innate trait, suggesting that anyone can develop this skill with practice and patience. Studies show that self-discipline is more predictive of success than IQ. Neuroscientific research indicates that self-discipline affects the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control. This explains why individuals with high self-discipline are better at delaying gratification and maintaining focus. The first step in cultivating self-discipline is setting clear, attainable goals. Whether it’s pursuing a career, achieving fitness milestones, or learning a new skill, having a well-defined objective provides direction and motivation. Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Connecting with the underlying reasons for your goals amplifies your resolve. Reflect on why these goals are important to you. This deeper understanding fuels perseverance, especially during challenging times. Establishing a daily routine is essential in building self-discipline. Routines reduce the need for constant decision-making, allowing you to allocate your mental energy towards your… "

It’s not just a meditation on loneliness; it’s an exploration, a journey into the very core of human existence. Having recently had the privilege to read this thought-provoking work, I’m compelled to share my reflections and urge you to embark on this introspective journey. Before delving into Svendsen’s analysis, let’s define loneliness. Is it merely the absence of companionship? No. As Svendsen articulately conveys, loneliness is a complex emotional state, one that can be experienced amidst a crowd or in the quietude of solitude. It is existential, and everyone, at some point or another, grapples with it. Here’s a general overview: 2. Historical Perspectives: Svendsen delves into how loneliness has been perceived and interpreted throughout history and across cultures. 3. Loneliness vs. Solitude: An exploration into the fine line that separates the two, emphasizing how one can be in solitude without feeling lonely. 4. The Social Dimension of Loneliness: Discusses the societal implications of loneliness and how modern society, with all its connectedness, might actually be exacerbating feelings of isolation. 5. Loneliness in Literature and Art: A look at how loneliness has been portrayed and reflected upon in various art forms. "

With a few swipes, taps, and clicks, we can hail a ride, order a meal, or catch up with a friend halfway across the globe. Smartphones have revolutionized our daily lives. But amidst this tech-driven utopia, there lurks a pervasive shadow: iAnxiety. What exactly is iAnxiety? It’s that constant buzz of nervousness and mental distress that’s intrinsically linked to our modern gadgets, particularly our smartphones. Before you shrug this off, let me paint a picture with some personal anecdotes, eye-opening research, and insights from my journey as a digital wellness advocate. Every morning, I used to wake up to a barrage of notifications. Emails, messages, reminders, social media alerts — you name it. Instead of starting my day fresh and focused, I’d often get caught up in a whirlwind of digital tasks. By evening, my eyes would burn from screen fatigue and my mind would be overwhelmed by information overload. Sound familiar? The issue wasn’t just physical discomfort; it was deeper. A low hum of anxiety accompanied me wherever I went. Every ‘ding’ from my smartphone made my heart race a tad bit faster, and the FOMO (fear of missing out) was real. What if I missed an important message? What if I didn’t respond quickly enough? The ‘always on’ mentality took its toll. Now, you might be thinking that my story is merely an isolated case. However countless research studies have demonstrated that I’m far from alone. "

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

But that’s dead wrong… Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to respond to them in a healthy way. For example: Of course, it’s hard work to cultivate a healthier relationship with your emotions — one that allows you to be resilient and strong in the face of painful feelings instead of fragile. But it is possible. And the most effective way to do it is to build consistent habits that promote a more tolerant and accepting relationship with all your feelings — even the painful ones. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to cultivate these 4 habits. Like anything painful, our automatic response to difficult emotions is to try and control them — usually in an attempt to escape them or “fix” them. And this tendency to control makes sense given how good at exerting control we are in most areas of life: In many areas of our life, it’s helpful and productive to exert control over our problems. But here’s the thing… Emotions aren’t under our direct control. Go ahead and try it: Of course, these are ridiculous experiments to run because you don’t have a happiness dial you can just adjust at will. Or an anxiety button you can just turn on and off. You can only control your emotions indirectly, primarily through how you choose to think and what you choose to pay attention to. For example: When you try to control things you don’t have control over — like your feelings — you’ll only create more pain and suffering for yourself in the long run. Emotionally strong people take control over their attention and what they choose to focus on. Instead of letting their mind bounce around according to the whims of instinct, they practice holding their attention on what matters and avoid getting sucked into unhelpful thought patterns like rumination or worry. If you want to be more emotionally strong, validate your emotions and control your attention. Most people associate emotional strength with toughness and being hard on themselves. This makes sense because as children this is what most of us learned: That if you wanted to be strong — a strong student, a strong athlete, a strong musician — you had to be strict and hard on yourself in order to achieve. Unfortunately, this toughness approach doesn’t work real well with difficult emotions. And in fact, the harder you are on yourself for feeling bad, the worse you’ll end up feeling. For example: Here’s the bigger point: When you respond to painful emotions with negative self-talk, you train your brain to be ashamed of feeling bad. Emotionally strong people realize that it’s actually much more helpful to be compassionate and understanding with yourself when you feel bad. In other words, they practice compassionate self-talk. Now, if that sounds a little woo-woo or new-agey, it’s not at all. Self-compassion simply means applying the same standard of kindness and support that you would give to a friend who was struggling to yourself. For example: True emotional strength comes from gentleness, not criticism. Emotionally strong people listen to their emotions but never take orders from them. Unfortunately, our cultural attitude toward emotions tends to be one of extremes… Most people see emotions either as silly and to be ignored or gotten rid of or that they are quasi-mystical experiences guiding us toward truth and ultimate enlightenment. In reality, emotions are much more mundane. They’re a survival mechanism that adapted over hundreds of thousands of years. And while they’re quite useful in some situations, they’re just as often unhelpful in others. For example: The point is simply this: Your emotions will lead you astray just as often as they will guide you. Emotionally strong people know that in the face of difficult decisions, it’s best to listen to their emotions. But ultimately, they use their values and reason to guide their decisions, not the emotional whims of the moment. Think about it: Listen to all your emotions but don’t blindly take orders from them. Emotionally strong people are able to resist the pull of unhelpful emotions because they’ve spent time discovering and clarifying their values. As a result, they’re able to make decisions that are good for them in the long-term rather than just impulsively acting on whatever feels easy in the moment. It’s hard to set and enforce healthy boundaries… But it’s even harder to live without good boundaries… Emotionally strong people know that you can’t be emotionally healthy if you never stand up for yourself and your own wants and needs. Unfortunately, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries is a classic short-term/long-term problem: Like eating a healthy diet, studying in school, or investing your money instead of spending it wastefully, what feels easy in the short-term doesn’t usually lead to great results in the long run. And what feels difficult in the short term often leads to much better outcomes in the end. So too with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries… But here’s the thing… Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Saying no to an overbearing manager or manipulative family member feels bad in the moment. But don’t mistake the fact that it feels bad for whether it’s a good decision or not. If you want to become more emotionally strong, practice communicating your wants and needs assertively and having the courage to set (and enforce) healthy boundaries.

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

Whether in business, interpersonal relationships, or everyday situations, negotiation plays a pivotal role in achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. This skill is not just about haggling over prices; it is a nuanced art that fosters collaboration, builds relationships, and navigates the challenges of our dynamic world. The Essence of Negotiation At its core, negotiation is a dialogue between two or more parties with the aim of reaching an agreement. It involves a give-and-take process where individuals seek common ground while preserving their interests. Negotiation isn’t a zero-sum game; rather, it’s a strategic dance where both parties can emerge victorious. In professional settings, negotiation is a cornerstone of effective leadership and management. From salary discussions to contract agreements, the ability to negotiate empowers individuals to assert their needs, address concerns, and find compromises that drive success. Similarly, in personal relationships, negotiation fosters understanding and strengthens connections by finding solutions that satisfy both parties. Adapting to Hard Times In challenging times, negotiation becomes even more critical. Economic uncertainties, global crises, and personal setbacks demand a heightened level of adaptability. The ability to negotiate allows individuals to navigate through uncertainty, leveraging flexibility and creativity to find solutions. In business, negotiating during tough economic periods can be the difference between survival and closure. Entrepreneurs, for instance, may need to renegotiate contracts, adjust pricing structures, or collaborate with competitors to weather the storm. The art of negotiation becomes a lifeline, enabling businesses to pivot and adapt to the ever-changing landscape. On a personal level, negotiation can help individuals manage crises and conflicts. Whether dealing with a family crisis or navigating a personal setback, the ability to negotiate allows individuals to communicate effectively, seek support, and find solutions that enable resilience.

Having said that, I am not saying I consider myself ‘not important’ anymore. It simply means, I and my words don’t matter to everyone and everywhere. I was ignored as a child. I wanted my friends to listen to me until I felt invisible. There were times when I was saying something but then two of my other friends would start a completely different topic like my voice was only heard by me. It was a long time ago. An age where normal kids wouldn’t even think of such things. But there I was. However, the more I was unheard, the more I developed the desire to be heard. As a result, I developed the habit of sharing my opinions where I had no right to speak, with people to whom my thoughts weren’t invited, and at places where my presence or absence didn’t matter. Before you throw Instagram cliche quotes, let me tell you one harsh reality: For example: Almost a year ago, I was on my way to meet my cousins. I am not particularly close with any of them. However, I was going to attend a wedding where they all were coming too. When I was on my way, I found myself picturing everyone sitting and having fun. In the same imagination, I also pictured myself talking about my ‘unique’ point of view on dog adoption. Yes, there I was. In my imagination, I was telling one of my cousins that people who adopt ‘great looking dogs’ just to ignore the street dogs are the biggest hypocrites. It’s the street dogs who need our help and care not the good-looking ones who are forced to breed until they die. That’s not animal love, that’s cruelty. "

While working full time, having a family, friends, obligations, etc. who as has time to learn a new skill? Unfortunately, there won’t be a day where we magically have more time or energy. Whether it’s a career related or personal goal, getting outside of our comfort zone has to be intentional. It’s a lot easier to stay in the same familiar place versus changing our routine. Continue reading to find out what your comfort zone might be costing you in the long run. Fear of the UnknownA recent studied showed 52.3% of Americans are unhappy at work (Forbes). If more than half of the company is unhappy, why do they stay? Comfort Zone. There is mental stability and comfort in a routine. Getting up each day and knowing where we’re going, is safe and comfortable. When we get a new job, we have to meet new people, learn new systems, and many other unknowns. Most of us fear the unknown. When we fear something, our brain tricks us into thinking we’re doing the wrong thing (Thought Catalog). If we fear it, then it must be wrong. Getting out of our comfort zone means we are psychologically working against ourselves. It has to be a conscious effort. To Leave or Not to LeaveIf you’re unsure about staying or leaving your current job, did you know that it can cost you money to stay? If you’re looking to make more money each year, statistically you are better off starting a new job. The average raise when starting a new job is between 10% to 20%. That’s a big jump compared to the average raise from a current employer is only 3% per year. That number is even smaller when you consider inflation is around 2.1%. This means that if you get a 3% raise, but inflation is 2.1%, your yearly increase could actually be less than 1% (Forbes). This is not to undervalue employee loyalty and working for a great company. Leaving a stable environment isn’t right for everyone, and if you love your job, then money isn’t the be all end all. Depending on what your goals are, it’s important to consider both options. "

Netflix, Facebook, and Google pay top dollar and offer some of the best benefit packages to ever exist. On the other side, turnover rates are also higher than ever before. Today, the average person has four different jobs before the age of thirty two. Twenty years ago, the averaged person had only two jobs before they were thirty two (CNN Money). The question is, do better perks equal happier employees? See what we found keeps employees happy and tenured at a company. The PeopleGood employees will stay at a company longer when they like their coworkers. The more people get to know each other, the better they work together. Our brains are hardwired to connect with each other. The modern workplace has become a community for people to get many of their social needs met (Forbes). It can become like a second family. Even though it’s hard to measure the return on investment for “fun” at work, it’s there. Look at attendance and attrition rates to see a difference. When employees feel the company is investing in them, they invest more in their job. The company’s success becomes their success. Money vs PurposeAt a certain point, more money is not going to be a deciding factor. Money provides an initial incentive, but it will not keep employees happy at their jobs. Once our physical survival needs are met, we look for emotional fulfillment (SimplyPsychology). People want a sense of purpose with their jobs. They want something to work towards besides a paycheck. Feeling needed by your employees, or being good at your job, can be a much a higher motivator than money. Money might attract new talent, but purpose will attract and keep talent. ExperienceIn the last decade+ there has been a shift in career planning. People don’t worry about where they will be in thirty years, they worry about the next three years. The perks of a good work life balance, or job experience are more appealing than a good retirement plan.

https://medium.com/@PsychOfBusiness/politics-at-work-3-reasons-to-avoid-the-conversation-4f75d8049129?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"With the recent election, it seems impossible to avoid the political water cooler talk. Every policy change, DC happening, or #alternativefacts interview, creates an abundance of opinions. The opinions are usually very polarizing. The question is whether you should share yours at work. If you decide to join a political conversation, here are three things to consider first: 1. You’re At Work.You have to see these people every day. If you get into a heated debate, are you going to feel comfortable seeing them the next day? The other thing to consider is if they will feel comfortable seeing you everyday. A study showed “33% of workers cited [politics] as a major contributing factor to feelings of unhappiness in the workplace” (onrec). If you’re involved in the conversation, be careful who can hear you. Pay attention to where you have the debate, and your surroundings. A coworker listening from a distance is also someone who you could offend. 2. People Are Passionate.Politics covers countless topics from money, to relationships, to lifestyles. There is always going to be differences in the way people feel and vote. This election was especially unique. A 2016 study showed that, “47 percent [of employees] said people are more likely to discuss politics in the workplace this election season than in the past” (APA). If you’re talking to someone and their passion turns into a scene, how are you going to react? An innocent debate can turn into the spotlight of inappropriate office conversation. It could damage your working relationship or reputation. Suggest meeting after work to continue the conversation. 3. Not Everybody Wants To Fight Fair. Understand who you are fighting with. What influence (if any) do they have over your employment and career growth. Do you report to them? Are they friends with your boss? Think about the future, you never know if your professional career paths will cross again. No matter how professional someone is, emotions can override logic during political discussions. A study conducted in Washington DC found that “27% of working Americans reported at least one negative outcome as a result of political discussions at work” (American Psychological Association). Since we are only a few months into our current presidency, there will be plenty of offensive things to come. Your opinions today can influence your future tomorrow. Debates can be eye opening and insightful. They should happen, but make sure it’s in the right setting. Some families choose not to discuss politics at all. There is too much disagreement around it. Consider what it can do to your working relationships, and career before partaking. Try to understand the other side and how you could offend someone, whether it’s intentional or not.

There are many reasons we look for a new job; better pay, career opportunities, benefits, etc. Nobody leaves a job that they are 100% happy in, but exactly how many people are unhappy at work? According to Forbes, “52.3% [of employees] are unhappy at work” (Forbes). That means half of the people in your office could be looking for new opportunities. Everyone will have different priorities for making a career change. If your next company aligns with your goals, then there’s a good chance you’ll be happier in your new role. 2. Did I Make a Mistake?Buyer’s remorse is natural. No matter how unhappy you were at your last job, you’ll ask yourself if you made the right decision. Change forces us out of our comfort zone, and “there [is] an emotional impact to everyone” (Forbes). Every new task can feel like an uphill battle. Eventually you will be comfortable and confident at your new job. During the tough moments, focus on the positives that attracted you to the job. 3. I’ll Never Learn All of This.Are you feeling like a small fish in a big pond? Even the simplest task can get the best of your emotions. Finding the closest printer, bathroom, or parking space can seem like a hurdle. Nobody likes to feel stupid and ask questions that they used to know the answer to. It takes time to figure things out. In most jobs, “it takes anywhere from three to six months to feel like you know what you’re doing” (USNews). Hang in there. Change is good for growth, and everyone feels vulnerable when they are new. Take AdvantageNew employees have a grace period as “the new guy” or “the new girl”. Use that to your advantage. Even if the answer seems obvious, ask a lot of questions. There is vulnerability when we doing anything new. Don’t feel bad or give up, the uncomfortableness is normal, and it will pass. Good Luck! Be the first to hear about our latest articles. Click HERE!

https://medium.com/@PsychOfBusiness/the-road-to-success-3-things-stalling-your-drive-121b1baff67?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"If you ask anyone “do you want to be successful”, most of us would say yes (of course!). Wanting success and working to achieve it are two different things. The real question is, do we want it enough to work for it? Do we want it enough to stay home and work while our friends are going out? There are three things we tell ourselves that prevent us from getting to the next level. 1. I Don’t Have Enough Time. Everyone has the same amount of time in the day. There are countless distractions keeping you from achieving your goals. If Elon Musk can create Paypal and SpaceX within the same decade, what’s our excuse? The difference is, he prioritizes his goals better. The key is to understand what the top priorities are in our life. Is it your job, your fitness, your family, your money, or your social life? Create a priority list with your top two priorities. If fitness and career are your top two priorities, then (unfortunately) bottomless mimosas won’t fit into that. What we do in our “spare time” will create the results for the rest of our life. 2. I Have Too Much Going On Right Now. There is no right or wrong answer to what your goals are. If your social life, family life, or personal time are what is important to you, then great. If you want to get promoted or be a successful entrepreneur, your time will focus on that. Being successful at anything takes (a lot) of time. Harvard Business Review surveyed 1,800 business executives about their time management. The study found “64% of Executives [admitted to] having too many conflicting priorities”, resulting in a drop in execution (HRB.Org). If you’re not sure what you want, look at your actions and what they say you’re interested in. If they line up, then keep going. If they don’t, then reprioritize your schedule. 3. I Don’t Know How. With the internet at our fingertips, we can always find out “how to”. If we Google ‘how to [insert anything]”, there will be an abundance of answers. With no experience, we can learn how to install new plumbing, start a blog, or create a fitness plan in the same month. The hardest part of starting a big project is the first step. The idea is easy, but the next action can be paralyzing. The old saying is true, ‘how do you eat an elephant? one bite at a time” (Creighton Abrams). Don’t worry about what happens at step 5. There will be many problems at step 3 or 4 that will change what you do at step 5 anyway. Creating problems before they are problems is demotivating and unproductive. We all choose what our priorities are. It is up to us how we spend our time. Before telling someone “I don’t have time”, consider an alternative. The better answer might be “it’s not a priority for me right now”. People will respect you more, and your mind will be free to worry about the things that are your priority. Good luck!

Jaws Drop. Along with those changes, Lakers shocked (and excited) fans by naming Magic Johnson as the new President of Laker Operations. Magic has long time been a fan favorite as a player, part owner, and Laker Adviser. The organization has recently struggled to provide the winning players and seasons they’re known for. The Lakers haven’t “made the playoffs since 2012–13, which also marks [their] last winning season” (BleacherReport). In an effort to get the “Magic” back in the Lakers organization, Jeanie Buss released this statement: Mitch KupchakMitch Kupchak has been the Lakers General Manager since 2000. With one of the longest GM tenures in NBA history, all of Los Angeles is surprised by his departure. Kupchak has been praised and blamed throughout the years for Laker performances. Kobe Bryant at one point called him “a mess”, but later praised Kupchak’s strategic moves saying “he goes from an F to an A-plus” (DenverPost). Unfortunately, Kupchak has failed to rebuild the Lakers organization in the recent years, and his time has run out. With nobody announced as his replacement, it is up to Magic Johnson to choose Kupchak’s replacement. Jim Buss: Will he be missed?Probably not. Even more surprising than Mitch Kupchak is Jim Buss’s departure. Who knew you could be fired from a team your late Father owned? Jim Buss took over operations from his later father, Jerry Buss in 2013. Jim has failed to live up to expectations. With a string of failed attempts to run the team, one most notably when the Lakers had the opportunity to get Phil Jackson back as head coach. The Lakers won five of their sixteen titles under Jackson’s coaching. Buss approached Jackson with the opportunity to coach again, but before any decision was made “Buss called Jackson in the middle of the night to tell him he’d hired Mike D’Antoni” (CBSSports). Laker fans were outraged and the team got swept in the first round of playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs (4–0). Even more controversial, Jackson was involved with Jim’ Buss’s sister (and owner) Jeanie Buss at the time. Jeanie said she was “stunned” by her brother’s decision. Earvin “Magic “JohnsonEarvin Johnson, more commonly known as Magic Johnson got his nickname from a sports reporter in High School (NBA.com). Johnson was drafted by the Lakers into the NBA in 1979. During his 13 seasons with the Lakers, Magic won five Championships, and three Most Value Player Awards. Magic announced his retirement in 1991 because of his contraction of the HIV virus. With little education at the time, people really didn’t know how to respond to it. Johnson has publicly stated his regret for retiring. The BusinessmanJohnson’s on court success transferred into the business world. While still in the NBA, Johnson created Magic Johnson Enterprises (MJE), an investment company, and at one point “owned 105 Starbucks and a 4.5% stake in the Lakers” (Entrepreneur). Perhaps his biggest business deal to date was his purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Magic, and an investment firm, purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion, which marks the biggest purchase for a sports franchise in history. Bring Back the MagicCan Johnson find time to own the the Dodgers, and bring the Lakers back to champion contenders? The Dodgers don’t seem bothered with Magic’s new career opportunity. Team President, Stan Kasten, said Johnson’s role in the team’s day to day decisions “has largely been hands-off” (DodgersNation). With the Dodgers not taking up his time, the future looks good for Laker fans. The decision to bring back Magic is just what the team needs. His knowledge of the game, long history with the Lakers, and proven business track record, are the right pieces in place to turn the team around. Are you excited with this move?

https://medium.com/@PsychOfBusiness/youre-hired-4-tips-to-nailing-your-first-interview-62e78a16cf50?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"It’s all about the prep work. You can be the most charming person in the room, but if you don’t prepare, you’ll get out hustled. There are common signs you are interested in a job; Did you research the company? Are you able to explain your resume?, but what else are they looking for? Everyone wants an edge over the competition. Not everyone is great at interviewing, or thinking on their feet. Use these tools to improve your chances of wowing your interview panel. Study the job description. See what they need for the position and what they list as “nice to have” skills. After you understand the difference, then get specific with your answers. Highlight how you fit into the ‘must haves’ with tangible examples. Business News Daily elaborated, saying “if you want to say you’re a team player, include a point about how you collaborate with colleagues in other departments to achieve company goals” (Nicole Fallon Taylor). You wouldn’t want to highlight your lack of experience by being vague. For each bullet point have an example ready to explain your expertise in that area. Imagine being asked “tell me about a time…” followed by one of the listed requirements for the job. Click HERE for The Most Common Interview Mistakes Lying will only waste everyone’s time. If you have to lie right away, the employer will figure it out by the final round. When something listed in the job description is unfamiliar, do some research. Tech Recruiter Sarah Zalzar recommends putting a positive spin on your lack of knowledge, “I haven’t work with it professionally but because I knew it was a requirement for this job, I did some research”. (Sarah Zalzar). The initiative to learning a new skill could save you a job that you are not qualified for. If it is a learnable skill (i.e. familiarity with excel), watch a youtube video on excel basics. Learn all you can so that you can confidently say that you have been exposed to it. This way you can say you are familiar without lying. Added Bonus: A-Z Guide for Interview Prep. Figure out before the anyone else if you are qualified for the job. Learn about the company, their culture, goals, and size to determine if you are a good fit. With close to 900 hires, Verizon Digital Media’s Marketing Recruiter advises: “If you want to impress the recruiter, look at the company’s latest press release/news feature and ask some questions” (Amiyra Luqumaan). It is important to understand the company as much as the position. It shows the interviewer that you have done your research. Have your own elevator pitch if they ask you what you know about the company or why you want to work there. Understanding the company and the job helps you sell yourself better. In a scenario where it comes down to you and an equally qualified person, they are probably going to pick the person they like more. Research the person you are speaking to. With social media, it shouldn’t be too hard to find something. Do they have a Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc? Forbes Top 25 Marketing Influencer Aaron Orendorff writes “Of course, you gotta have the goods as well as the relationship”, but “what made the difference was that relationship” (Build Relationships). Keep in mind that this is icing on the cake, it should not be the focus of your interview. If you waste too much time trying to personally connect, you’ll run out of time to tell them how qualified you are. You won’t get hired because they like you, but if it’s a close call, it could make the difference. Last Chance: What to Answer Before Your Interview. After leaving an interview you should feel good. Whether you get the job or not is still to be determined. Having a good interview doesn’t always guarantee the job, but it will prepare more for the next one. Although you always want to get each job, sometimes it is just a stepping stone for the next opportunity. Each interview is practice for perfecting your interviewing skills. This guide is here to help make sure you don’t miss out on an opportunity because you weren’t prepared. "
https://medium.com/@PsychOfBusiness/top-8-buzzwords-that-should-have-stayed-in-2016-302f3904e28f?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"There is a lot of office jargon that sneaks into our vocabulary throughout the year. It usually ends up sounding like a lot of fluff, and not a lot of action. Let your hard work and planning speak for itself. Using these buzzwords or phrases will only hurt your credibility. During any planning and strategizing, use more originality and avoid these cliche office buzzwords. 1 . Circle Back Everyone in the business world has heard the phrase, “lets circle back later”. Most of the time later just means “not now”. Circling back is a fancy way of not wanting to talk the current topic or issue. Business News Daily cited “Circle Back” as one of the most “common (but annoying) [buzzwords] in the modern workplace”. The actually meaning of circle back is “to return” (Webster). If you catch yourself using this phrase, try switching it for “let’s talk about this next week”. That’s what you really mean, and it’s more direct. 2. Low Hanging Fruit We all need the emotional boost of crossing small items off of our checklist from time to time. Low hanging fruit is kind of like that. Low hanging fruit is a “thing or person that can be won, obtained, or persuaded with little effort” (Definition). This strategy is about finding the fastest and easiest way to get a victory, no matter what size. While it may bring fast satisfaction, it is not a long lasting or winning strategy. Low hanging fruit “may be tempting, [but] the true rewards come from climbing higher and stretching for the real treasure” (The Balance). If you catch yourself saying this too often, it’s time to reassess your game plan. Reach for the higher (more rewarding) fruit in 2017. 3. Quick Wins This buzzword is interchangeable with “low hanging fruit”. A quick win is “an improvement that is visible, has immediate benefit, and can be delivered quickly after the project begins” (enfocussolutions). If you’re looking for a morale boost, then this will help, but nobody made it to the top focusing on “quick wins”. Beside it being a less than successful plan, your coworkers and employees are sick of hearing it. Go for a big win versus a quick win in 2017. 4. At a High Level This buzzword can cause confusion and resentment in the office. The term means “having senior authority or high status: high-level personnel” (Dictionary.com). In office terms, high level is the “where you want to go” versus the “what you do when you are there” details (Quora). A Manager may say “we are discussing the options at a high level”. What they mean by “high level” is the overall picture. Usually it is not a person’s intent to exert their authority when using this phrase. Unfortunately it can come off that way. There is too much room for misinterpretation. If we need two definitions to understand it, let’s leave this phrase in 2016. 5. Dig In This phrase is commonly referenced at the dinner table, “let’s dig in”. They mean let’s eat, dig into the meal. In the business world “dig in” means “to begin to process something, or to go work on something” (TheFree). Just because it’s the holidays doesn’t mean we need to decorate our vocabulary. Try using the terms ‘start’, or “get to work” instead of “dig in”. Less confusion and fluff in the business world is always a good thing. 6. Move the Needle Moving the needle is often used to show results. It describes a shift in “some area, activity, sphere etc. to a noticeable degree” (WordSense). The needle is a starting point, and moving it is the progress. For Venture Capitalists, “if something doesn’t move the needle, meaning that it doesn’t generate a reaction (like, positive cash flow), they don’t like it much (Forbes). Unfortunately it’s becoming a go to cliche phrase around the office. Avoid incorporating this term in your reports and proposals. Your coworkers will thank you. 7. Bandwidth There are several different meanings of bandwidth. The way it was most overused in 2016 is “as a synonym for capacity or ability” (TechTarget). For example, “we don’t have the bandwidth to take on a new project”. Bandwidth is often cited as the reason an assignment can’t be done. Be careful of how often you are telling your boss or coworkers that you don’t have the ability to perform a task. Bandwidth has become a more acceptable business term for just saying no. Think about how you’re using the term and get more creative in 2017. 8. (Does it) Scale? The term “scale” is so common in the business tech world. If something scales, it has the “capability to cope and perform under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well [can] maintain or even increase its level of performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands (Scalability). In other words, if a system is performing well at a low level, it can be just as successful at a higher level. The problem is, there are a lot of innovative ideas that don’t have a clear way of scaling up. Since there is not a clear way it can be used on a larger size, the idea is put on hold. Consider the possibility your business is not going to triple in size immediately. If your business doesn’t plan on instant growth, your idea doesn’t always need to scale. Buzzwords sneak into everyone’s vocabulary. Continuing into 2017 these are the top 8 buzzwords that should stay in 2016. All of the buzzwords can be said without using the cliche phrases. Originality is underrated in the workforce. Remove these words and increase your credibility. Let us know what buzzwords you are sick of hearing around your office? Want More?

https://medium.com/@PsychOfBusiness/why-92-of-new-years-resolutions-fail-f7d80576c29d?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"The biggest problem with New Year’s resolution is making them without a plan. Your success will live or die by how you define (or don’t define) your goals. If resolutions were easy to achieve, then you would already be doing them. Fulfilling a New Year’s resolution requires sacrifice, and is usually a disruption to your daily life. Whether it is sacrificing time, money or energy, it is not something you are always going to want to do. Follow these three steps to increase your odds of success in your 2017 resolutions. 1. Make Plans Not GoalsThe first thing to do is make the distinction between your goal and your plan. Have you ever made the same resolution two years in a row? So many of us fall into this trap and here’s why. Creating a goal is easy, but making a change is not. Each year about 45% of the Americans (143.5 million people) make New Year’s resolutions, but only about 8% (11.4 million people) succeed (Statistics). A resolution is not supposed to be a wish. It is a goal you have to work on to achieve. Think of the resolution as where you want to be, and your plan is how to get there. Write down your New Year’s plan instead of New Year’s resolutions. Added Bonus! Access our 5 Ways to Turn Great Ideas Into Success Stories. 2. Get SpecificGet specific with your planning. Whether your goal for 2017 is to get in better shape, eliminate debt or get a promotion, what does that look like? According to Huffington Post, the most popular resolution for 2016 was to “enjoy life to the fullest” (Michael Lazar). Living a full life is different for everyone. If you want to live a full life, figure out what the fullest life looks like to you, and how to get there. Trouble articulating what your plan looks like? Answer these questions: 3. Buddy SystemsYou are not always going to be motivated by your goals. It is important to set up a system to keep you on track even when you feel like giving up. The most “successful [people] understand that they cannot achieve their visions alone” (Forbes — Kathy Caprino). A buddy system is about accountability. Find someone who supports your goals and wants you to succeed. The support system is “especially important towards the end of January and early February”. According to fitness experts, February is “when the first few weeks of momentum [die off]” (Today). Motivation is high when goals are set, and a backup plan increases your chance for long term success. Beat the odds! Here are 5 Ways to Turn Great Ideas Into Success Stories. Final ThoughtsThe best predictor of the future is past behavior. If you want to achieve something different, then your actions have to be different. Ask yourself, “What is different this time?”. If there is no change, then you are probably going to end up with the same result. Use these three steps to keep yourself accountable and realistic with your goals. Good luck and Happy New Year! "
https://medium.com/@casanderson/why-practicing-gratitude-is-good-for-your-health-32855b5aeaa7?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"For as long as I can remember, my mom’s family has spent Thanksgiving together. For years we gathered — uncles, aunts, cousins — at my grandmother’s small ranch home in Southern Georgia — with some of us supplementing the traditional dinner with a late night trip to Waffle House. Then in 2004, our family suffered two tremendous losses. First, my mother died in July — only 4 months after being diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer. Then, my grandmother died in November, following a short illness likely brought on by the death of her only daughter. That year we gathered at a funeral, not over turkey. And I wondered whether our tradition would continue, given the absence of the two women who had — like in most families — organized our family gatherings for decades. But my uncle — now the oldest living child — rose to the occasion. He set up a schedule in which each family would alternate hosting, with my brother and I stepping in for our mom. We’ve now continued that plan for the last 18 years (with a one year interruption in 2020 due to covid). Much will be written this week about the stress of Thanksgiving, from the difficulties of traffic jams and delayed flights to the challenges of cooking a turkey and pleasing picky eaters. But this week is a great time for us all to instead focus on what we’re grateful for in our lives — and empirical research reveals that doing so is good for our happiness and our health. Researchers in one simple study randomly assigned people to one of three groups: Before the study started, all participants had kept daily journals recording their moods, physical health, and general attitudes. The researchers could then compare how people in these different groups changed over time. Can you predict the findings? People who focused on what they were grateful for felt 25 percent happier — they were more optimistic about the future and they felt better about their lives. People in this group also reporting exercising more and had fewer symptoms of illness. Although this study was conducted with relatively young, healthy people, other research reveals very similar benefits for people struggling with serious challenges. People with neuromuscular disorders, which cause joint and muscle pain as well as muscle atrophy, who write about things they are grateful for in their daily lives show greater satisfaction and more optimism. Women with breast cancer who spend ten minutes a day writing about their gratitude toward someone in their life show better psychological well-being as well as better adaptation to cancer. These findings all tell us that focusing on what you are grateful for has real and substantial benefits, even among people struggling with serious, even life-threatening health conditions. This year it’s my turn to host the annual family gathering, and I’m feeling very grateful that our tradition has continued. My family includes a diverse range of people: meat-eaters and vegetarians, Southerners and Northerners, Republicans and Democrats. We share allegiances to different sports teams and almost definitely voted differently in this year’s midterm elections. But we’re family — and this year will add yet another set of Thanksgiving memories, from putting out a brush fire that nearly got dangerously out of control in my grandmother’s yard to canoeing on a river in Northern Florida to eating deep dish pizza in Chicago. And I’m grateful not only for another year of creating memories with aunts and uncles and cousins, but also for my wisdom in ordering the entire meal from Whole Foods. Thanks for reading!

https://medium.com/wise-well/with-depression-we-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-our-friends-d989e2648916?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"This article is part of a Wise & Well Special Report: The United States of Depression. Forty-four percent of college students report experiencing symptoms of depression and 37 percent report experiencing symptoms of anxiety, according to the March 2023 Healthy Minds Survey, an annual web-based survey examining mental health among college students. Fifteen percent report seriously considering suicide in the last year — the highest rate in the history of the survey. Similarly dim statistics show up in surveys of other young adults, and also adolescents. As a mom of three young adults, and a professor who teaches many college students, these numbers are heartbreaking. But the good news is that the current mental health crisis on college campuses and elsewhere around the country is decidedly not inevitable. Empirical research, including work I’ve conducted in collaboration with my colleagues and thesis students, provides valuable insight into how parents, educators, and peers can help foster better psychological well-being, in college students and anyone struggling with depression or prone to its symptoms. Many college students spend considerable time and energy trying to present themselves as thriving — academically and socially. Adolescents care deeply about fitting in with their peers, and are highly motivated to hide any signs of weakness or insecurity. This tendency makes it really hard for a person to admit they need help, especially when they think they’re the only one having trouble. This tendency is often described as the “duck syndrome,” the idea that people are paddling furiously under the surface to stay afloat while simultaneously presenting the image of a cool, relaxed individual, gliding on the water. Duck syndrome is the “feeling that everyone is doing really well except for you,” wrote Ishaan Singh, a student at Stanford University, where duck syndrome was first coined, “and the feeling that everyone around you is in total control but that everything is falling apart for you.” This feeling of isolation — “It’s only me who is struggling” — of course makes mental health issues feel even worse. To help correct such misperceptions, and reduce feelings of isolation, my thesis student Kate Turetsky and I designed several brief mental health workshops for college students. Two months later, we measured the effects of all three workshops on students’ attitudes. We found that students clearly benefited from receiving accurate information about the prevalence of mental health issues on campus. The workshop correcting misperceptions about mental health issues on campus was just as effective as the general education workshop at improving attitudes toward seeking professional help for mental health issues. This workshop was also more effective than the stress management workshop. Although our study did not find evidence that receiving accurate information about mental health norms led to an increase in actually seeking help, our follow-up period of two months may have been too short to see such an effect. Prior studies demonstrating the role of attitudes in predicting behavior suggest that these students might be more willing to seek therapy for mental health issues in the future. And given the epidemic of suicides among undergraduates, this kind of behavior change could well help save lives. Empirical research clearly demonstrates that developing meaningful social connections can go a long way toward improving psychological well-being. People who are more socially connected to their community are happier, physically healthier, and report fewer mental health problems. Such connections may be especially valuable for adolescents and young adults, who often prioritize social relationships above all else. One of the most promising approaches to fostering such connections on college campuses is ProjectConnect, a program designed to help small groups of people get to know each other and build relationships quickly. ProjectConnect is specifically designed to build connections, and thereby reduce loneliness and improve well-being. My thesis student, Lexa Harpel, and I conducted a study to examine the immediate and longer-term effects of ProjectConnect on participants’ mental well-being. Participants (including 59 students and 22 staff) from Amherst College were randomly assigned to participate in the program in the fall semester, or to wait until the spring semester. Those in the ProjectConnect program participated in five weekly hour-long sessions, including: Results from the one-month follow-up revealed that people who participated in ProjectConnect showed decreases in loneliness, suggesting that even a relatively brief opportunity to build connections can lead to substantial benefits. These findings are particularly encouraging given findings from a nationwide study of nearly 33,000 college students revealed that two-thirds of students report feeling lonely and isolated. “Helping build stronger connections on campus may be the most powerful thing we can do to improve student mental health and well-being,” says Jessica Gifford, Founder and Chief Connection Officer of Project Connect. “Every act of connection — large and small — makes a difference. When you connect, you protect.” Like many young people, college students spend considerable time with their friends: They eat together in common dining halls, attend classes and study together, and may even sleep together in the same dorm rooms. Friends are therefore likely to be among the first to recognize signs of mental health issues — and may be uniquely able to help students get mental health services. In fact, a 2019 survey by the American College Health Association found that among students who seek help for their mental health, most initially did so after being encouraged by a friend. College students often receive training in how to intervene in the face of different types of problematic behaviors, from binge drinking to sexual assault. My students, Katie Siegel and Tommy Mobley, and I therefore conducted a study to examine different strategies for increasing college students’ willingness to help a peer struggling with mental health issues. One hundred fifty college students were randomly assigned to one of three brief (15-minute) online workshops. Our findings from a three-month follow-up reveal that even brief online interventions can play a role in reducing the mental health crisis. Students who received training in specific skills to help a friend, or who got information correcting common misperceptions about mental health, reported less fear that intervening would hurt their friendship. This fear often inhibits people from intervening when they worry a friend needs help. Alleviating the fear may help someone intervene when they see a friend who is struggling. Our research suggests that increasing help-seeking behavior among college students likely relies on their willingness and ability to speak up when they worry a friend needs help. Increasing training in bystander intervention for mental health concerns may play an important role in linking peers to on-campus mental health resources and improving college students’ psychological well-being.

https://medium.com/@casanderson/join-me-for-medium-day-august-12th-69d5399d22f5?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"I love talking about psychology — especially when it doesn’t involve grading! So I’m thrilled to be speaking this Saturday, August 12th as part of Medium Day. Want to join me? I hope you will — and here’s my schedule! First, at 2 pm I’m participating in a panel discussion entitled “The Professors Are In: How Medium Can Help Academics Spread Their Ideas and Build Their Followings.” This 45-minute panel includes two other professors and should be an active and lively discussion. Second, at 3:30 pm I’m talking about The Science of Happiness. I’ll share ten strategies (all based in empirical scientific research) for finding more happiness. My goal in this session is for everyone to learn something new, laugh a little, and, most importantly, find at least one strategy you can use to increase happiness in your own life. And don’t worry — none of these strategies are “sell all of your belongings and move to Aruba!” (Although at the moment that idea is sounding very appealing to me.) I’ll speak for 15–20 minutes and then leave 10–15 minutes for questions (which is almost my favorite part). If you’ve liked my writing about happiness, giving, gratitude, nature, and relationships, I think you’ll really enjoy this session. Finally, at 4:30 pm I’m talking about The Psychology of Courage and Inaction. I’ll describe why good people so often fail to speak up in the face of problematic behavior of all types, from bullying to sexual misconduct to corporate fraud. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.” I’ll end by sharing a range of practical strategies we can all use to speak up in our personal and professional lives. I’ll plan to speak for 15 to 20 minutes, and leave about 10–15 mintues for questions. If you enjoyed my recent piece on psychological factors contributing to hazing, I think you’ll really enjoy this session. So, save the date! Medium Day is on August 12th, and I’ll be speaking at these times: Register now to secure your free ticket. I hope to see you on Saturday — and follow me on Instagram for regular tips on happiness and health! "

We went to Walmart to buy a mini fridge and rug. We hung posters above his bed. We attended the obligatory goodbye family lunch before heading to our car to return to a slightly quieter house. Two weeks later, Andrew called me, his voice breaking. A student in his dorm had just died as a result of head trauma after a fall the young man took while extremely drunk. Media coverage in the months following indicated that instead of seeking help immediately after the fall, the young man’s friends waited nearly 20 hours to call 911. At that point, it was too late for potentially lifesaving medical treatment. I’m a mom of three and a professor who studies social norms — the unwritten rules that shape people’s behavior. In my book “Why We Act: Turning Bystanders into Moral Rebels” I explore the factors that keep people from speaking up in the face of problematic behavior of all types. I’ve thought about the story of my son’s classmate often as reports recently surfaced of the widespread hazing among players on the Northwestern University football team, four of whom are suing the institution. Hazing is remarkably common; for instance, one NCAA report states 74% of student-athletes experience it. Thankfully hazing-related deaths are more rare. I suspect the root cause of these kinds of tragic situations on college campuses is the same: misperceiving what other students are thinking and feeling. Problematic behavior in group settings — from students ignoring signs of a medical emergency to athletes hazing freshman recruits — often continues because people privately feel uncomfortable with what they see happening yet believe their peers don’t share their concerns. This perception, regardless of its accuracy, leads people to stay silent because they fear the consequences of speaking up: Will doing so lead to rejection from the group? The most common reason male college students give for failing to speak up in situations involving sexual misconduct is fear of being laughed at or ridiculed. This fear is a normal part of human nature. But it weighs especially heavily when you’re an 18-year-old in a new environment and want desperately to fit in. Psychologists call this condition pluralistic ignorance: A majority of people privately believe one thing but incorrectly assume that most others feel differently. Pluralistic ignorance explains why most college students feel there’s too much alcohol use on their campus but believe other students are perfectly comfortable with the amount of drinking. It explains why most college men privately find sexually aggressive behavior offensive but wrongly believe that others endorse it, and why many athletes may privately disagree with hazing but believe that their peers support it. Why do people fail to recognize that others might in fact share their own beliefs — about hazing or alcohol use or sexual misconduct? It’s because people tend to believe that the behavior of others reflects their true thoughts and feelings. Thus, if other people aren’t speaking up to share their concerns about hazing, you might assume they must be perfectly comfortable with such behavior — even though you’re aware that your own behavior does not always match your beliefs. So what can parents, coaches and college administrators do to prevent hazing? Empirical evidence demonstrates that educating students about the psychological factors that lead people to misperceive what others are actually thinking and feeling can make a real difference. My own research has shown that women have lower rates of disordered eating if they learned as freshmen how campus social norms contribute to unhealthy body image ideals. I’ve found that college students who learn that many of their peers struggle with mental health challenges have a more positive view of mental health services. So the first step in preventing hazing is to talk to college students about pluralistic ignorance — what it is and how it happens. Understanding the psychological processes that lead them to misperceive what those around them are actually thinking is the first step in helping students speak up in the face of bad behavior. The next — and crucial — step is to shift norms about what group loyalty means. In tight-knit groups — such as athletic teams — people feel considerable pressure to show loyalty to other group members. This sometimes translates into staying silent in the face of bad behavior by their peers — sticking together, regardless of right or wrong. But the same underlying dynamics of peer influence and group cohesion can help create more positive beliefs and behavior. How? By shifting norms about what it means to protect group members. Instead of staying silent about bad behavior, the expectation becomes stepping in to keep them safe. This approach to changing their behavior teaches students that a single bad act hurts the reputation of the entire group, that all members of the group have a responsibility to protect their friends. Being a good friend, fraternity brother, or teammate means speaking up, not staying silent.

https://medium.com/wise-well/why-blue-space-is-actually-better-than-green-space-be2dc29830?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"A few years ago — aided by selling a rental property we’d owned for decades — my husband and I bought a beach house that we could almost afford. We texted our three children from the real estate office, telling them we had both good news and bad news. The good news was, of course, that we had bought a beach house. The bad news was that we could now only afford to send two of them to college (a comment meant in jest, although our middle child eagerly volunteered to skip college). This house is about five hours from our home in Massachusetts, so the trip is not easy. But every time we arrive, we see the ocean and the stress of the drive — the traffic jams, the suboptimal bathrooms, the fast food snacking — fades away. And our experience is not at all unusual. There’s a reason why people pay more for a hotel room — or house — with a view of water: Looking at water helps calm the body and reduce arousal. It decreases our heart rate and blood pressure and increases hormones, such as serotonin and endorphins, in the body that make us feel good. In one of the earliest studies to examine the beneficial effects of looking at water, a researcher at the University of Delaware measured people’s brain waves while they looked at pictures of nature that included either green space (natural vegetation) or blue spaces (water). People who were looking at blue-space pictures showed lower levels of brain activation, indicating simply looking at pictures of water is relaxing for the brain. But looking at water doesn’t just help us relax. More recent research suggests images of water can lessen help people manage routine dental procedures, such as having a cavity filled or a tooth pulled. Researchers in this study randomly assigned patients to one of three conditions: Some took a virtual walk — using a virtual reality headset — around a local beach; others took a virtual walk around a local city; and still others received standard care. Patients who took a virtual walk around a local beach reported less anxiety and pain than those who received standard care or took a virtual walk around a city. They also remembered the dental procedure more positively a week later, indicating that even virtual exposure to water leads to lasting beneficial effects. One of the largest studies to examine the impact of so-called “blue spaces” — oceans, rivers, lakes — collected data from more than 20,000 people in the United Kingdom. Using a smartphone app that tracked people’s specific location, researchers asked the participants to report their overall sense of well-being at random points throughout the day. They then calculated how close people were to different types of natural environments, including marine and coastal locations as well as different types of green spaces. No surprise: People were generally much happier when in any type of natural environment than in urban locations. But all nature was not equally beneficial. People were happiest in marine and coastal locations. Why does spending time in marine and coastal locations make us feel better? One explanation is that looking at a vast body of water puts our own stressors in proper perspective. “Seeing ourselves in a coastal space allows us to let go of things in a way that other spaces don’t,” notes Catherine Kelly, author of Blue Spaces: How & Why Water Can Make You Feel Better. “Here I am, this small thing. So my problems are maybe not that big after all.” And for anyone not fortunate enough to live near water, here’s some encouraging news: Looking at water even in an urban environment — such as a river or canal in the midst of a city — can make you feel better. In one study, researchers in New Zealand examined whether blue spaces (the Tasman Sea on the north, the Pacific Ocean on the south) and green spaces (forests, parks) were visible from various residential locations. They also examined residents’ overall level of psychological distress. As predicted, people with a view of the ocean had significantly better mental health than those without. (Interestingly, there was no association between having a view of green space and mental health.) Now, you might be thinking that other factors may explain this relationship. After all, it’s pretty likely that people living in a home with an ocean view are wealthier and/or older, which could account for these findings. But the researchers controlled for these factors when analyzing their data, and still found clear evidence that people whose homes have a water view have better mental health. Spending time near blue spaces may even have lasting benefits for mental health. A study last year examined data from more than 15,000 people living in 18 different countries. Participants reported how much time they had spent near water — rivers, lakes, oceans — during childhood, including how close they lived to blue spaces, how often they visited, and how much they played in these settings. They also reported on their current mental well-being and regular exposure to blue spaces in the last month. As predicted, people with more exposure to blue spaces during childhood were more likely to spend time in blue spaces as adults. These early life experiences seem to lead to lasting preferences. But more importantly, their data also revealed that people with more exposure to blue spaces during childhood reported better mental health during adulthood. Why? Childhood exposure to blue spaces led people to spend more time in such spaces later in life, which in turn led to better mental well-being. “Our findings suggest that building familiarity and confidence in and around blue spaces during childhood may stimulate an inherent joy of nature and encourage people to seek out recreational nature experiences, with beneficial consequences for adult mental health,” said Valeria Vitale, a doctoral candidate at Sapienza University of Rome and the lead researcher. If you are interested in learning more about the benefits of spending time by the water, check out Blue Mind, a book by marine biologist Wallace Nichols that describes how water is good for both mental and physical health.

https://medium.com/wise-well/five-easy-strategies-for-improving-your-mental-health-9b372c7d8c8b?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"I gave a talk a few years ago on the science of happiness at a large financial services convention in Orlando. At the end of my lecture, a woman approached me to tell me how much she enjoyed my presentation. And then she paused and said, “To be honest, I almost didn’t come to this talk, because I figured that I would really hate you.” Her comment was — let’s just say — unexpected. So, I thanked her for her unusual compliment and then asked her why she had such a negative expectation. “I just figured that anyone who talked about happiness for an hour would be all about rainbows and kittens and that by the end of the hour I would want to strangle you,” she said. This example illustrates a really important finding from the field of positive psychology (and — spoiler alert — it’s also the opening in my book). There are indeed some people who are naturally happy; these are the “kittens and rainbows” people. If you are one of those people, congratulations — and you can stop reading this piece right now because you certainly don’t need any advice on finding happiness. Unfortunately, I am not one of these “kittens and rainbow” people. My natural tendency is quite honestly one of doom and gloom. But here’s the good news for those of us who don’t naturally and easily find happiness — empirical research clearly demonstrates that even taking simple steps in our daily lives can improve mental well-being. And in honor of Mental Health Awareness Month (May!), I’m sharing my five favorite strategies. We already know exercise is good for us physically. It helps us maintain a healthy weight, strengthens muscles and bones, and lowers heart rate and blood pressure. But exercise isn’t just good for physical health — engaging in regular physical activity is also good for our mental health. Exercising helps us feel better in part because it distracts us from problems we may be facing. It also leads to physiological changes in our bodies. When we exercise, the brain releases chemicals — endorphins — that actually make us feel better. Exercise may, at least in some cases, may be as helpful at treating depression as psychotherapy or antidepressants. In one study, researchers assigned 156 adults with clinical depression — a severe level of depression that disrupts daily life — to one of three groups: The researchers then examined people in all three groups over time to see if levels of depression changed. Their findings revealed that people who engaged in aerobic exercise, even when they received no drugs to help with their symptoms of depression, showed improvements in mood for as long as four months. In fact, people in all three groups improved at the same rate. This study provides important evidence that moderately strenuous exercise can be as effective as drugs in treating depression. Spending time in nature helps both our brains and our bodies to relax. Exposure to nature basically switches the body from a state of high arousal to one of rest and relaxation. Spending time in nature is therefore a great strategy for feeling better. Here are some of the key findings about the benefits of spending time in nature. People who walk through a park for an hour later feel less anxious than those who walk along a busy street. They also show lower levels of rumination, which leads to depression. Spending time in nature also reduces the physiological toll of stress. For example, research from Japan on shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing,” meaning spending time in a forest area) shows that walking in a forest for twenty or so minutes leads to lower levels of blood pressure, heart rate, and the stress hormone cortisol compared to walking in an urban area. These findings explain why people who regularly spend time in nature — including city parks and private gardens — report lower rates of stress and stress-related illnesses.15 As Kristen Malecki, a professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health notes, “If you want to feel better, go outside.” There’s a great Chinese proverb about the benefits of giving: If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help someone else. As this Chinese proverb advises, giving is one of the best ways to boost mental well-being. Moreover, anything counts, from giving money to charitable organizations to volunteering in your community to donating blood. To examine how giving leads to happiness, researchers asked random people on the street if they were willing to participate in a quick psychology study. People who agreed were then asked to rate their happiness and provide their phone numbers. They were then handed an envelope that contained either five or twenty dollars. They were told to spend the money in the envelope that day and were also given specific instructions about how to do so. Participants were then called that evening, after they had spent the money, and were asked to report their happiness. Perhaps not surprisingly, there was no difference in happiness between those who got five versus twenty dollars. However, people who spent money on someone else reported greater levels of happiness than people who spent the money on themselves. This study reveals that spending as little as five dollars on someone else — even someone we don’t know — makes us feel better. One of the most consistent findings in the field of positive psychology is that spending money on experiences — seeing a concert, attending a sporting event, taking a trip — leads to greater happiness than spending money on belongingness. Spending money on experiences increases happiness in part because it’s far more enjoyable to anticipate experiences than a new material good. For most people, the anticipation of an experience (“I can’t wait to spend a week in Rome!”) evokes far more happiness than the anticipation of the arrival of a material object (“I can’t wait for my new car to arrive”). And scientific research demonstrates that people who anticipate something experience greater enjoyment than those who do not. For example, researchers in one study asked college students to participate in a “chocolate rating” study. Half the students were asked to immediately eat Hershey’s Kisses or Hugs, and then to rate their enjoyment of this chocolate. The other students were also asked to eat and then rate the chocolate but only after waiting for thirty minutes. Can you predict their findings? Students who had to wait thirty minutes reported liking the chocolate much more than those who were able to eat it immediately. There’s a great quote in one of the Winnie-the-Pooh books by author A. A. Milne that precisely illustrates the joy of anticipation: “Well,” said Pooh, “what I like best,” and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn’t know what it was called. And, of course, that word is anticipation. One of the first studies to demonstrate the importance of having close personal relationships examined factors predicting men’s well-being from adolescence through the end of their lives. The findings were clear: the only real and consistent predictor of happiness was relationships. As Dr. George Valliant, the lead researcher on this study, wrote, there are two pillars of happiness: “One is love. The other is finding a way of coping with life that doesn’t push love away.” And subsequent research bears out this finding again and again. And close relationships doesn’t just make us happier — they are also literally good for our health. People with close relationships have lower blood pressure, stronger immune systems, and faster recovery from surgery faster. Most importantly, they have longer life expectancies. One of the earliest studies showing the power of close relationships on health examined social connections in nearly seven thousand men and women living in Alameda County, California, in 1965. Overall, people who lacked social ties — with family members, friends, or social groups — were two to three times more likely to die during the seven-year follow-up period than those with such connections. The empirical research is clear: having high-quality relationships — with a spouse or other romantic partner, family members, and friends — is the best route to living a happy, healthy, and long life. So here’s the single best strategy for improving your mental health: devote time, energy, and effort on maintaining and deepening your close relationships. Thanks for reading!

https://medium.com/wise-well/the-best-strategy-for-avoiding-regret-take-a-chance-32a9e306f2ea?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"Last month I received a call from my middle child, a college senior, with quite surprising news. He’d just received an offer from the Peace Corps to spend 27 months working in Peru. My immediate response as a Mom — after offering him my congratulations — was to worry. Peru is a very long way from our home in Massachusetts, and given the limited time off for Peace Corps volunteers, he likely wouldn’t return home during that entire time. But when he asked for my advice, I took a deep breath, and said “I think if you don’t go, you’ll regret it.” My advice was decidedly not based on my preferences as his mother. Instead, it was based on my knowledge of the psychology of regret. We can all think about choices we’ve made that might have seemed wise at the time, but later we come to regret. Perhaps it was where you attended college, your major, or a particular career path. Perhaps it was a relationship you stayed in longer than you should have — or failed to pursue at all. Researchers in one study examined the most common types of regrets for American adults. Their findings revealed the following six biggest regrets (in order of frequency): education (“I should have studied harder”), career (“I should have become a dentist”), romance (“I wish I’d married Jake instead of Bill”), parenting (“I wish I’d spent more time with the kids”), self-improvement (“I should have started exercising sooner”), and leisure (“I wish I’d visited Europe”). These six categories account for 86 percent of all the regrets listed. Research also consistently shows that we experience more regret over things we choose not to do than things we choose to do. In other words, regrets of inaction haunt us more than regrets of action. In one study, people were asked what they would do differently if they could live life over again. More than half of the regrets had to do with inaction — should have attended or completed college, should have pursued a particular career, should have tried harder in social relationships or marriages. In contrast, only 12 percent were regrets of action — shouldn’t have smoked, shouldn’t have gotten married so early, shouldn’t have worked so hard. These findings explain why we are often haunted by paths not taken — our choice to turn down an appealing but less certain job opportunity or fail to express our romantic interest to a friend due to a fear of rejection. Why do regrets of inaction linger more than those of action? One explanation is that it’s easier to overcome regrets of action. Let’s say you took a job you thought was going to be great, but come to recognize it was the wrong choice. You can quit that job — or at least look for another position. Or perhaps you chose to spend your limited vacation time taking an expensive cruise — only to realize that cruising isn’t really your thing. You can — and should — make different plans for your next vacation. In other words, we can deal with bad choices we’ve made by learning from our mistakes. It’s far harder to recover from regrets of inaction. If you didn’t apply for a job, or turned down a job offer, at this point there’s little you can do to fix that choice. That position is almost certainly filled, and you’ll never know if it would have been a better fit. If you failed to pursue a long-time crush, that person may now be married, and you’ll never know where that relationship would have gone. Another explanation is that we process regrets of action versus inaction in different ways. Regrets of action often prompt a clear emotional response, such as guilt, sadness, or anger. We recognize that mistakes were made, and we respond accordingly. But it’s harder to process — or come to terms with — regrets of inaction. This uncertainty helps explain why regrets of action tend to fade over time, whereas regrets of inaction may instead increase over time. Many people — perhaps even most people — go through life afraid of taking a chance. Why? Because taking a chance feels risky. It can lead to disappointment, failure, or rejection. And as one of my closest friends always says, “rejection is never a party.” Taking a chance does risk failure and disappointment and rejection — but there’s honor and value in trying, no matter the outcome. As Teddy Roosevelt famously said, “The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena, who strive valiantly; who know the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spend themselves in a worthy cause; who at best know the triumph of high achievement; and who, at worst, if they fail, fail while daring greatly, so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.” This type of risk-averse mindset can also have lasting consequences. It encourages us to settle for safety instead of venturing boldly into the unknown. So we stay with jobs we don’t find rewarding and in relationships that don’t make us happy. The findings from empirical research in psychology are clear; if you want to avoid future regret, take a chance. As author H. Jackson Brown Jr. wrote, “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” Thanks for reading! Follow me on Instagram for regular tips on happiness and health! "
https://medium.com/wise-well/change-your-stress-mindset-change-your-life-2dcbaa34fb98?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"A couple of weeks ago I was driving to give a talk when a massive traffic jam suddenly appeared. I sat on I-95 in an absolute standstill, watching the minutes tick by — and getting increasingly nervous that I wouldn’t arrive on time. Eventually traffic started slowly moving again, albeit in a single lane. I then passed what had clearly been a terrible accident: three firetrucks blocked most of the highway surrounding three or four badly damaged cars. And of course my concern about being late seemed very unimportant. This example illustrates the powerful role of mindset, or thought patterns, in influencing our experience of stress. My initial thought was that being late for my talk was a terrible outcome. But this thought shifted as I recognized that experiencing a major car accident was far worse. Many people think about stress as a negative and something to be avoided because it leads to poor outcomes: low test scores in children, career burnout in executives, and “choking” in athletes. This mindset increases anxiety, disrupts performance, and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, people who see stress as a normal part of daily life and with a positive mindset experience stress as exhilarating and invigorating, and they reap the benefits of this extra energy to respond effectively to various challenges. As you might predict, people with this type of mindset often end up with better overall outcomes. These are the folks who do their best work under pressure and when stakes are high. This type of mindset is how elite athletes approach high-stakes competitions, such as a must-win playoff game or the Olympics. The way we think about stress also has a major impact on physical health. People who think about stress as detrimental and debilitating show higher levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in response to challenging situations. Over time, this physiological response can lead to bad health outcomes, including higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. But it isn’t just the experience of stress that affects health — the very perception that stress affects health also has an impact! Researchers in one study asked nearly twenty-nine thousand people to rate their overall level of stress over the last year and how much they believed that stress affected their health — a little, a moderate amount, or a lot. People who reported having experienced a lot of stress and who also believed that stress had a large impact on their health were 43 percent more likely to die over the next eight years. In contrast, people who experienced a lot of stress but did not feel stress had a major impact on health were no more likely to die than those who had experienced little or moderate levels of stress. This finding tell us that it isn’t necessarily the experience of high levels of stress that increases the risk of mortality. Instead, what’s particularly detrimental is having a high level of stress coupled with the belief that stress leads to negative health outcomes. In fact, people who believe that stress affects health “a lot or extremely” are more than twice as likely to die from a heart attack compared to those without such beliefs. But here’s the good news: Regardless of your natural tendency, you can shift your stress mindset. Understanding the role of mindset in influencing how you think about stress is the first step in learning how to reframe it in a new, more positive way. People who learn strategies for reframing stress in a more adaptive way — as energizing and inspiring, not just exhausting and debilitating — show better psychological and physical well-being. For example, college students who learn about the benefits of stress, including how stress increases arousal and thereby leads to improved academic performance, show lower levels of math anxiety and better test scores. This type of reframing reduces cardiovascular stress and its overall wear and tear on the body. Here’s a simple example about the practical benefits of changing our stress mindset. Researchers in one study assigned employees at a large financial institution to watch one of two videos. The first group watched a stress-is-debilitating video, which described various harmful aspects of stress, including its role in poor performance at work and negative health outcomes. The second group watched a stress-is-enhancing video, which described the benefits of stress for improving creativity, productivity, and the immune system. As the researchers predicted, people who watched the stress-is-enhancing video showed substantial benefits. They reported better work performance, as well as lower levels of anxiety and depression. We can’t control what life throws at us, but we can all practice reframing difficult events as challenges instead of threats. And this simple shift in mindset has substantial benefits for our psychological and physical health. Thanks for reading! Follow me on Instagram for regular tips on happiness and health! "
https://medium.com/@casanderson/a-simple-strategy-for-boosting-happiness-and-health-spend-time-in-nature-e5c52aeb2646?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"A recent analysis published in The Washington Post examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey to compare rates of happiness across people in different professions. This analysis of America’s most — and least — happy workers revealed fascinating findings. Who are the least happy workers? Lawyers. (And as one married to a lawyer, this was not a particularly unexpected finding.) Who are the most? These results I found much more surprising: lumberjacks, foresters, and farmers. These three occupations share one key feature that is rather obvious: these are jobs that involve working outside. And these jobs don’t simply involve being outside — instead, they involve being outside in nature (as opposed to say, a construction worker building a skyscraper or an interstate highway). These findings help explain why many companies spend vast sums to bring nature into the workplace, from the meeting rooms with vine-covered walls in Amazon’s Seattle headquarters to the forest of trees on Apple’s campus in Cupertino, California. What’s so good about spending time in nature? Here’s what empirical research reveals. Think about a time you’ve walked on a beach, strolled through a flowering garden, heard the sound of birds chirping, or merely looked through a window at grass and plants. How did you feel? For many people, seeing, hearing, or even thinking about nature makes us feel more energetic, peaceful, and alive. This is why we pay more for a hotel room with a view of the ocean or a home with a great lawn. In one study, researchers examined data from more than ten thousand people living in Britain. Study participants provided ratings for their overall mood as well as life satisfaction. This data also included information on where the people lived, so that researchers could measure the amount of nature — including gardens, parks, and water — they are exposed to daily. But perhaps most important, this data was collected annually for eighteen years, which allowed them to test how moving to a new location (which could contain a different amount of nature) was associated with mood and life satisfaction. These findings revealed substantial benefits of living in environments near nature. Specifically, people who lived near nature showed significantly lower rates of anxiety and depression, and significantly higher rates of overall life satisfaction. Results from a study conducted in various neighborhoods in Wisconsin revealed similar findings. Across all income levels, people who lived in a neighborhood with more than 10 percent tree canopy were less likely to report depression and anxiety. Spending time in nature helps both our brains and our bodies to relax. Exposure to nature basically switches the body from a state of high physiological arousal to one of rest and relaxation. People who walk through a park for an hour later feel less anxious than those who walk along a busy street. They also show lower levels of rumination, which can lead to depression. In one fascinating study, participants wore caps containing electrodes so that researchers could assess brain activity. The researchers then compared how the brain responded to different types of environments. As they predicted, people walking in a parklike setting showed calmer brain waves, including lower levels of arousal and frustration, than people walking in urban areas. This type of short-term exposure to nature even helps reduce the physiological toll of stress. For example, research from Japan on shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing,” meaning spending time in a forest area) shows simply walking in a forest for twenty or so minutes leads to lower levels of blood pressure, heart rate, and the stress hormone cortisol compared to walking in an urban area. These findings explain why people who regularly spend time in nature — including city parks and private gardens — report lower rates of stress and stress-related illnesses. Given the role nature plays in reducing stress and arousal, it’s not surprising that people who spend time in nature experience better overall physical well-being and fewer health-related complaints. For example, people who live in neighborhoods with more green space, such as trees and parks, have lower levels of chronic illness, including diabetes, hypertension, and lipid disorders. People who spend time in nature also have lower rates of high blood pressure. In fact, some evidence suggests that visits to outdoor green spaces of thirty minutes or more each week could reduce the prevalence of hypertension — a major contributor to other chronic disorders — by as much as 9 percent. Most important, longitudinal research reveals spending time in nature can actually lengthen our lives. Researchers in one study monitored more than one hundred thousand women who completed health questionnaires over a period of eight years. They also examined — using satellite imagery — the amount of green vegetation in a person’s neighborhood. Even after adjusting for other factors that increase the risk of death, women living in areas with the most greenness had a 12 percent lower rate of mortality than those living in areas with the least greenness. The scientific evidence is clear — spending time in nature is tremendously beneficial for happiness and health. And here’s perhaps the best news: even brief exposure to nature leads to increases in happiness. People who simply walk past clusters of greenery in a city show spikes in happiness, suggesting that even flower beds, trees, and small strips of green in an urban environment make us feel good. Similarly, people who have more exposure to any type of nature in their work environment — from seeing nature outside their window to having a live plant in their office to spending breaks outside — report lower levels of stress and fewer health complaints. So, don’t worry if you can’t imagine finding the time for a thirty-minute stroll outside each day — or don’t work as a lumberjack, forester, or farmer! You can improve your happiness — and health — simply by finding small ways to integrate nature into your daily life. Thanks for reading!

https://medium.com/@casanderson/five-strategies-for-developing-better-relationships-in-the-new-year-db9bffbd748d?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"As many of us focus on setting goals for the new year, it’s tempting to focus on those with clear and measurable outcomes: lose ten pounds, stop drinking, run a 5K. But as one who talks and writes about the science of happiness with great regularity, let me share what empirical research reveals: the most important goal we can all set for 2023 is to build and maintain good relationships. As described by Dr. George Valliant, the lead researcher on a famous longitudinal study examining factors predicting men’s well-being from adolescence through the end of their lives, there are two pillars of happiness: “One is love. The other is finding a way of coping with life that doesn’t push love away.” So, how can you prioritize relationships in 2023? Here are five relatively easy strategies. One of the simplest ways of fostering good relationships is to make a point of reaching out and staying connected, even in small ways. A recent study found that we consistently underestimate how much people appreciate these small gestures. This type of small reach out takes very little time or energy — yet means a lot. For the last few months, I’ve had a consistent morning routine of sending a brief text to a friend who is undergoing cancer treatment, just to say that I’m thinking about her. Occasionally she responds, but typically she doesn’t — yet she’s told me repeatedly how much my daily check-ins have meant. Another friend of mine has a lovely habit, which I am planning to adopt. He randomly buys small gifts for his friends for no particular occasion. Once he sent me a coffee mug with a photo of my dogs (and as anyone who knows me at all knows, this was a big hit)! The mug surely wasn’t expensive, but now I’m reminded of his thoughtful gesture each time I use it. Find ways to expand your social network. Volunteer, take a class, join a book club or pickleball team. Meeting new people — particularly in which you’re likely to already have something in common — is a great way to find potential friends as well as romantic partners. And when thinking about forming new social groups, it’s the more the merrier: people who belong to several different groups are happier. Another simple strategy is to develop a friendship with someone who’s already in your life. Invite a casual friend to meet for lunch, ask a colleague to join you on a coffee break, suggest taking a walk with a neighbor. These steps can help you get to know someone on a more personal level, and perhaps develop — or strengthen — a new friendship. We often think about relationships as the people we are closest to in our lives. But even brief personal interactions with strangers (what psychologists describe as “weak ties”) can increase positive feelings. People who report having more casual interactions — chatting with barista at your favorite coffee shop, making small talk with a neighbor, talking about your weekend with a colleague — on a given day report feeling happier. In one study, researchers offered people a five-dollar gift cards to Starbucks to initiate a conversation with a stranger on public transportation. These bus and train riders were initially pretty hesitant to participate, in part because they assumed that strangers would not be receptive to such an outreach. But they were decidedly wrong: most people who were approached were pleased to have a casual conversation with a stranger. Moreover, people who had such a conversation then reported higher levels of happiness than those who simply sat alone in silence. For many of us, the weekends are a great chance to catch up on household tasks and run errands, which can make the idea of putting on sweatpants and ordering take out on Saturday night really appealing. But making a plan for some type of social interaction is a much better route to happiness. In other words, go to that party, host a small dinner party, or meet some friends for drinks. Most of us tend to underestimate how good these types of social interactions make us feel (yet another example of errors in affective forecasting). This advice applies equally to people in romantic relationships. Researchers in one clever study asked dating couples to discuss some questions with another dating couples. Some couples were given pretty mundane questions about everyday life activities. Others were given questions about more intimate topics and were intended to prompt intense discussion. As you can probably predict, couples who discussed more intimate topics later felt closer to their own romantic partners. Close relationships are the single best predictor of our happiness. Yet a recent survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the average American spends on average only 34 minutes a day socializing with other people — compared to about 2.9 hours watching TV! How can we strengthen our existing relationships, with family members, friends, and romantic partners? Create some type of regular ritual so that spending time with the people you care about the most becomes part of your on-going routine. This could be lunch once a month with a friend, a Friday family movie night, or a weekly call with a sibling. Setting regular plans to see — or hear — people and catch up is an easy way to maintain, and even strengthen, our connections. And when you have these catch up conversations, don’t just share the good — the so-called “highlight reel.” Instead, focus on having substantive, meaningful conversations about things that matter. These conversations feel especially good because they allow us to be our real selves, to be authentic. And, not surprisingly, these are precisely the type of interactions that build strong relationships. So if your goal for 2023 is to feel happier — and that’s a great goal for us all — make a decision to prioritize your relationships. As Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert eloquently describes, “We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.” "

Now that I think about it, projecting this image of Jesus was probably part of some strategy to teach ten-year-old me how to behave. Be well-manned and nice. Jesus was nothing like that. In fact, Jesus was — in a cultural, social, and religious sense — a real troublemaker. Do yourself a favor. Open the Bible and discover who the real Jesus actually was. You might just have some misconceptions destroyed. You see, somewhere along the line, we created a ‘Jesus’ in our own image and began to impart that image to the world. But, unfortunately, the reality is that the Jesus you learned about in Sunday School probably doesn’t exist. If you grew up in the church, then I can’t speak for your experience. But, here are ten things that they didn’t teach me about Jesus in Sunday School — that have reformed my understanding of who Jesus actually was: I want you to do an experiment for me. Go to Google and do an image search on “Jesus.” The pictures that appear in your search results represent what people think Jesus might have looked like. What do you notice? Yes, that’s right! More often than that, Jesus is imagined as a blond-haired, blue-eyed, white guy who, to be honest, would comfortably fit the physical requirements of Hitler’s Aryan race. Except he was a Jew. Awkward. And because Jesus was a Jew, he almost certainly had Jewish features, such as olive skin, brown eyes, and black hair. Yes, Jesus probably looked more like that Middle-eastern man who lives in your neighborhood — you know the one who you treat as an object of suspicion and scorn — the one you speak of when you complain to your other white Christian friends about how Arabs are overrunning the country. Yeah, that guy — he looks more like Jesus than you do. "

The hotel that my colleague and I were in shook as explosions rocked the city. It was terrifying. After the bombing stopped, every time I heard a noise, I jumped. My boss back home got me on the phone and wanted to pull me out. I told him I wanted to stay. I did end up staying, and I’m glad I did. The next day, as we went to the place we were working at, I heard the sound of little children playing. Such a sound never sounded so beautiful as it did then. It’s at times like that that you realize that life is precious. Fast forward five years, and the bombs are still dropping. As someone who has been to the Gaza Strip and experienced bombings there, I deplore the current violence that has killed Israelis and now hundreds of Palestinians, including many children on both sides. I’m also saddened and frustrated with the fact that violence which has been going on for decades is only front page news when Palestinians are the perpetrators. When you see headlines which talk about ‘terrorists’ and which scream “Hell on earth”, it just cements the impression that Palestinians are always the bad guys while Israel is always the innocent victim. Nothing could be further from the truth. You never see front page headlines of the Israeli terrorism that is a daily occurrence for Palestinians. The nights when Israeli soldiers break into Palestinian homes and hold families, including children, at gunpoint, the bulldozing of Palestinian homes while illegal settlements are built next door, electricity running through a Palestinian village to the neighboring illegal Israeli settlement but not giving power to those Palestinians. Day and night, it never ends. Wouldn’t you be seriously pi$$ed off? The way this is being reported cements the impression that Israeli lives are more valuable than Palestinian lives. "

I suggest we leave it alone.” But the Senior Pastor wouldn’t let it go. In his mind, it was part of his job to ensure that the congregation upheld what he perceived to be certain unquestionable moral standards as described in the Bible. Of course, the Bible says nothing — not a single word — about pre-marital sex, but that seemed irrelevant to him. He saw it as a duty to protect the spiritual integrity of the church as he saw it. And so, the worship leader’s private life, which should have been handled with compassion, care, and, well,… privacy… was dissected with self-righteous indignation by the leaders of the church. The outcome of this inquisition is so predictable that I hardly need to mention it. Needless to say, he left the church, along with his partner, and they remain happily married and disconnected from a faith community because hey… while the Pastor might have ruthlessly upheld a moral standard, as he saw it, he also destroyed two people in the process.

Daniel was an Evangelical, and on more than one occasion he lectured me on how the Bible condemns homosexuality. To truly be a Christian, he said, the Bible said I couldn’t live “a gay lifestyle.” Eventually Daniel cut me out of his life when we were in college, equating his acceptance of my life as a gay man akin to taking an alcoholic to a bar. In a long, rambling letter, he quoted scripture repeatedly, pointing to passages he and other conservatives say condemn homosexuality. These passages have been aimed like weapons at the hearts of LGBTQ+ Christians, destroying their faith — and sometimes their lives — in the process. There are six passages in the Christian Bible that supposedly condemn homosexuality: Reading these passages in most modern English translations of the Bible, one would likely accept at face value the conservative’s claim that homosexuality is categorically forbidden. When we examine these passages more closely, however, in their original languages while placing them into their historical and theological context, we see this is definitely not the case. These are just homophobic attempts to shoe-horn the modern concept of homosexuality into ancient writings. In this article, we’ll examine those six passages and show how they are commonly mistranslated and misinterpreted to denigrate homosexuality. Neither the Christian Bible, God, nor Jesus condemns homosexuality. Sodom and Gomorrah may be the two most famous cities ever destroyed. Their story is told in Genesis 18 and 19, and referenced multiple times in both the First and Second Testaments as an example of God’s punishment for wicked behavior. (1) Conservatives have twisted the moral of the story, reading it as an outright condemnation of all homosexual sex. A close reading of the story however shows that’s not the case. Most scholars now agree that the primary transgression described was the violation of strict hospitality customs common in the ancient Middle East. In the story, God has decided to destroy the two cities if ten righteous people can’t be found. He sends two angels to the town to investigate, who are graciously welcomed and hosted by Lot, Abraham’s nephew. That night however, the house is surrounded by a mob: The angels then lead Lot and his family safely out of the cities, before God “rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven,” destroying everything that lived there. (Lot’s unnamed wife behind him, however, looked back, and turned into a pillar of salt.) It may be hard for modern readers to understand just how seriously hospitality was taken in the cultures of the ancient Middle East. Public sleeping and eating accommodations were not readily available and thus became a social obligation. According to one writer, “to be inhospitable was not only to be despicable, it was also to be irreligious.” (2) Another writer explains, “not only were public accommodations generally lacking, but the geographical and climatic conditions of many areas made it practically impossible for visitors to try to subsist for any length of time without some form of protection and help — at the very least provision of water and food — from the local population.” (3) The First Testament is full of examples of this requirement. (4) The ideal response to visitors is demonstrated in the first part of the story. When the Lord appears to Abraham with three visitors in the heat of the day, Abraham welcomes them, brings them water and prepares them a meal. Abraham follows a pattern of gracious hospitality (brining water, baking bread, offering shelter) that can be found in similar stories in the First Testament. (5) Further, a plain text reading of the story clearly shows the men of Sodom were not interested in homosexual relations per se, but rape as an act of sexual power. Rape was commonly used in the ancient world, as it is still today, as an act of intimidation and dominance. It’s a war crime. In instances like this of “power rape,” as one author notes, the sexual identities of both the perpetrators and victims are irrelevant. “Homosexual violation, usually by folk we would call heterosexual, in many societies is used to teach subordination to slaves, trespassers, strangers, and newcomers to a community. These stories do not speak of sexual inclination; they are about sexual violence to obtain power over strangers.” (6) The egregiousness of both sins — sexual violence and violating customs of hospitality — are more clearly demonstrated in another Biblical text, the story of an unnamed Levite and his concubine in Judges 19. In that narrative, a mob descends on the two as they are passing through the Benjamite city of Gibeah. That mob also demands the visitor, the Levite, be brought out to be gang-raped. Instead, the Levite offers up his concubine, who is raped until she collapses. The Levite then takes the concubine’s lifeless body home (it is unclear from the text when and where she dies), before cutting it up in pieces, taking it around to the other tribes of Israel, and demanding revenge. So egregious was the Benjamites’ transgression of hospitality with sexual violence that it started a civil war, nearly wiping out an entire tribe of Israel. The passage often draws parallels to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah—some scholars even insist the Gibeah narrative was written first. While conservative commenters are quick to use the same-sex sexual violence in Sodom and Gomorrah to condemn all homosexuality, they fail to do the same for the opposite-sex sexual violence in Gibeah. If homosexual power rape in Genesis 19 is the basis for prohibiting any homosexual act, why then is not heterosexual power rape not the basis for prohibiting any heterosexual act? Further, whenever the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, never is homosexuality listed as one of those sins. Only in one instance is general sexual immorality, not homosexuality, of Sodom mentioned (Jude 7, though the epistle may be speaking of a later Jewish tradition that says the women of Sodom had sex with the angels). (7) The prophet Ezekiel lists the “guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease but did not aid the poor and needy” (16:48–50). The prophet Isaiah declares the nation of Judah was almost destroyed for being too much like Sodom and Gomorrah, and then encourages them to “seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow” (Isaiah 1:9–10, 16–17). When Jesus himself invokes the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah directly, he references the cities’ inhospitality, foreshadowing the reception his disciples will face. He says that those who reject their message will suffer more than the people of Sodom (Matthew 10:15, Luke 10:12), and that had his work been performed in Sodom rather than Capernaum, the Sodomites would have responded better (Matthew 11:23–24). It was not until the 4th century CE that Christian authors started equating the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah with same-sex sexual intercourse outside of sexual violence, and even then it was only a minority opinion. It would not become a majority opinion until the Middle Ages, a subject we’ll return to in a minute. (8) Nestled in the “holiness code” of the book of Leviticus are two passages that seemingly prohibit any male homosexuality. In English, they are commonly translated along these lines: They seemingly support the conservatives’ argument that the Bible condemns homosexuality. But we must understand the context in which these rules were given, what they actually prohibited, to whom they applied in the ancient world, and to whom they apply today. Along with the two verses above, Leviticus also prohibits: You may have noticed that some conservatives who claim to “live by the Bible” also shave, eat bacon, love football, and wear polyester-blend clothes. I jest here to make the point about for whom these rules were written: ancient Jews. These prohibitions do not apply to modern Christian life because 1) they were specifically developed by an ancient culture for that ancient culture, and 2) theologically they do not apply to us because of the new covenant established through Jesus Christ. The laws of the First Testament were part of God’s covenant (or agreement) with the ancient Jews. They needed to be followed, and violations of the law (sin) needed to be atoned through sacrifice at the temple in Jerusalem for that covenant to be kept. According to traditional Christian doctrine, however, the life, death, and resurrection of Christ established a new covenant nullifying the old one and the rules which accompanied it. (9) The debate over whether or not Christians had to follow Jewish laws and customs was a main point of contention for the earliest Christians. This tension is reflected in Second Testament writings. The biggest issue was circumcision: Should non-Jewish, adult male converts be circumcised, as required by the Torah of Jews? In a world without modern anesthesia, this debate generated understandable controversy (at least if you ask me). To the Jews, circumcision was a mark of their covenant with God. Paul argued forcefully that circumcision was no longer necessary. “We know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ… If justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing” (Galatians 2:16, 21). (10) We’re saved through Christ, Paul argues, not by following the laws of Leviticus. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus himself declares that he has not come to abolish the law but fulfill it (Matthew 5:17) and later declares that all the laws of the Hebrew Bible can be summed up in just two: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind… [and] ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the Law” (Matthew 22:35–40, appears also in Mark 12:28–34 and Luke 10:27). Thus, Christians are not bound by the law of the First Testament. Going further, there are scholars who argue these verses in Leviticus prohibit only certain kinds of male homosexual sex. Leviticus 18:22 comes between two rules about sacrificing infants to the Canaanite god Molech and bestiality, both considered cultic, non-Jewish activity. Also, the Hebrew word translated as “abomination” here very often describes foreign cultic behavior in the Torah. As some argue, “what is condemned by the homosexual prohibition is not general homosexual behavior, but cultic homosexual relations in particular.” (11) The prohibitions are less about moral wrongs than they are about ritualistic purification and Jewish distinctiveness. (12) There are also scholars who believe Leviticus 20:13 condemns not male homosexual activity but pederasty. Pederasty is an abusive sexual relationship between an adult man and a younger male or boy that was not uncommon in ancient Greece and Rome. The translation of “man” in the first part of the verse allows for only an adult male, while the second word allows for a translation of “boy” (as it is translated elsewhere in the Bible). (13) Similarly to the seeming prohibitions in Leviticus, modern readers of English translations of the Bible encounter the word “homosexual” in two so-called vice lists of the Second Testament. These “vice lists and virtue lists are rhetorical devices used by Second Testament authors to give moral advice to Christians by calling attention to the bad behavior of unbelievers, to the bad behavior Christians still might have, or to the virtues to which Christians should aspire.” (14) Commonly condemned are envy, lying, gossip, murder and greed. In just two instances are some sort of male-male homosexual activity mentioned, translated by the more homophobic to prohibit all male-male sex. For instance, in 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, the ultraconservative New International Version (NIV) translations reads: What the NIV translates here as the phrase, “men who have sex with men,” comes from two separate Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai. The first means basically “soft,” an extremely common term that makes it hard to know exactly what Paul is talking about. Some scholars have posited it means being the receptive partner in anal sex (i.e. bottoming), while others see it as meaning violating traditional gender roles. (15) Until the 1200’s, this word was commonly understood as masturbation. No new discovery was made then, rather there was a shift in public morality against same-sex sex. (16) Conversely, the second word, arsenokoitai, is much rarer and its precise meaning is known. The word does not appear in Greek prior to Paul. Of the two Greek words from which it stems, arsēn means “male” and koitē means “bed,” which may signal why some translations have used the word “sodomite” or “homosexual offender. (17) Taken together, some scholars believe the pair points to pederasty. This, one author claims, is the same-gender sex “that would have been observed most frequently by Paul. These were the master, old man, abusive sexual partner, or pederast on the one hand, and the slave, young boy, or victim on the other hand. That is why Paul pairs them in this sentence; they may be euphemisms for the active and the passive participants in a sexual relationship.” (18) The term arsenokoitai reappears alone in a 1 Timothy vice list, an epistle scholars now believe was written by followers of Paul rather than Paul himself. Again, the ultra conservative NIV translates arsenokoitai in 1 Timothy 1:10 as “those practicing homosexuality.” The best guess of scholars is that the word is used again here as a reference to pederasty, although that remains uncertain. The recent update of the New Revised Standard Version translation (the NRSVUE, the most commonly used English translation by academics), translates the term in both places as “men who engage in illicit sex” while rightly noting that the precise meaning of the term is unknown. That brings us to the passage over which there is the most debate. While some conservatives agree with some of the affirming scholarship above, rejecting homophobic interpretations of other passages, most generally see two verses in Paul’s letter to the early Christians of Rome as blanket condemnation of all homosexual acts, both male-male sex and female-female sex. When read in context, however, this analysis quickly falls apart as well. Paul is clearly not condemning all homosexual sex acts, though scholars disagree on what precisely he is condemning. Beginning in 1:18, Paul writes: To some, what Paul is condemning is idolatry and homosexual sex related to it. They point to how the sexual acts are introduced in verse 26: “for this reason.” “That initial statement means that the homosexual behavior is the result of the idolatry described in the previous verses. In other words, the idolatry and the homosexual behavior go together and describe the same people… Paul is not speaking about all homosexuals; he is speaking about a specific group of homosexuals who engage in a particular form of idolatrous worship.” More specifically, the same writer contends Paul is condemning the Egyptian cult of Isis, given the passage’s reference to theriomorphic (animal) worship. (19) Another theory is that Paul is not condemning sexual acts at all. John Boswell, whose famous book Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality ushered in a new age of questioning homophobic exegesis (analysis) of Biblical texts when it was first published in 1980, argues: Going further, Boswell also argues that Paul is not saying homosexual behavior is unnatural. Even at that time, homosexual behavior was well known in animals and appears in contemporary literature. The people who “gave themselves up” were not going against a general law of nature, but giving themselves up to what is natural for themselves, their own heterosexuality. Also, to argue that Paul is saying there is a natural moral law against homosexuality being transgressed would be anachronistic. A theory of such natural moral law would not be fully developed for another thousand years after Paul’s death. (21) More recently, liberal Evangelicals have also read this passage not as condemnation of all homosexual sex, but of homosexual sex outside of monogamy. (22) Still others see Paul’s concern of who is the bottom, while others say Paul is again condemning pederasty. There is no clear consensus. Whatever Paul meant in Romans 1, or with the word arsenokoitai, it’s clear to scholars that he was not referring to the modern concept of homosexuality. The word “homosexual” itself didn’t appear in English until 1891, and didn’t appear in any Biblical translation until the 1950’s. (23) Efforts to shoe-horn the term and concept into the Bible reveals much more about the standards, mores, and homophobia of the culture of the translators than it does about what these ancient cultures actually considered immoral. As Boswell notes in his book, homosexual sex was fairly common and accepted as part of life in ancient Greece and Rome, particularly in major urban centers. It was not until the collapse of Rome in the 4th century that homophobia began to emerge in the Christian church (notably in the ascetic movement, i.e. Origen and Clement of Alexandria). It was not until 533 that the first laws banning homosexual sex were declared in Europe by the emperor Justinian. However, there’s no evidence that these laws were widely supported or enforced. Indeed, openly gay people, along with Jews and other outsiders, continued to flourish and rise to positions of power for quite some time. It was not until the late 12th and early 13th centuries, Boswell argues, that there was a profound shift in public attitudes towards homosexual sex and all non-procreative sexual activity more generally. The causes and repercussions of such a shift are beyond the scope of this article, but it’s safe to say the continued oppression of the Queer community stems in no small part from this shift. As a collection of ancient writings in foreign languages, the Bible is actually a great scapegoat for modern intolerance. Think about it: both the cultures which produced it and the languages in which it was written are so extremely foreign to us that one can find or create justification for just about any idea, no matter how oppressive it may be. As we have seen, some cherry pick, washing passages completely of context, while others anachronize, imposing modern ideals and beliefs on ancient writings. The homophobic interpretation of the passages above are examples of how conservatives regularly do both. The end result of this thinking has real life consequences. When we try to impose upon our lives and society the close-minded thinking of previous generations (i.e. the homophobia of 13th century Europe), that oppression, in turn, leads to the creeping evils of addiction, deaths of despair and suicide, and the outright horror of systematic oppression, murder, and genocide. A better way to understand the lessons of the Bible for our lives is examine each seemingly Biblical decree or story through the lens of the Greatest Commandment. If what we think we are reading on the page violates the only things God has commanded us to do (love Him, and love each other as we love ourselves), then what we are reading should not be a guide for moral living. Most conservatives, even the most homophobic, already do this to some extent. According to Jesus himself, divorce is only acceptable in cases of adultery or sexual immorality (Matthew 5:31–32). Most of us view following this Biblical “decree” as violating God’s commandment to love. For example, should a woman stay with her faithful, sexually moral though abusive husband? Leaving him would be an act of love for her children, who’s own emotional and physical safety are at risk. No moral person would condemn her for breaking Jesus’ decree that divorce should only be sought in cases of adultery. God’s commandment to love supersedes it. Similarly, we in the LGBTQ+ community are commanded to love others as we love ourselves. Inherent in this commandment is the fundamental advice so frequently given by RuPaul, “how in the hell are you gonna love somebody if you can’t love yourself?” Even if the Bible did prohibit gay sex, God’s commandment to love what he created — ourselves — would supersede such a homophobic commandment. Happy Pride everybody. FOOTNOTES: "

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

One of these words doesn’t belong on the list below. Can you guess which one? If you said, “Fryingpan,” then congratulations! You are right! Fryingpan is the ONLY ONE of the words on this list that appears in the Bible. In fact, the word fryingpan appears twice — in Leviticus 2:7 and Leviticus 7:9. As for the rest of this list: Not in the Bible — not even once. I often chuckle at Christians who leave comments on my articles saying things like, “The Bible says this or that,” or “The Bible is clear about this or that.” That’s because many of these Bible enthusiasts haven’t actually flipped through the pages themselves. Their knowledge of the Bible has come from what others have told them. You see, there are a whole lot of events, words, and sayings that people commonly attribute to the Bible, that are actually nowhere to be found between the leather-bound covers of God’s holy word. Don’t believe me? Here are a few examples: You’re a good Christian, so you know the Christmas story inside and out, right? You know that when Mary and Joseph rocked up in Bethlehem with Mary bursting at the seams in late-term pregnancy, they knocked on the door of some local inn and begged the innkeeper for a room. Alas, there was no room in the inn for poor Mary and Joseph, but the kind innkeeper allowed them to use his stable out the back. Except, there is no inn. And there is no innkeeper. Come to mention it, there is no stable, either. That’s right. The Bible doesn’t mention an inn in the Christmas narrative. And there is certainly no innkeeper telling Mary and Joseph that they could use his stable. If you don’t believe me (and some of you don’t), by all means, check for… "

Indeed, if I may be so bold, I was once — when I practised more — very accomplished in Photoshop et al. Nowadays, I’m a bit out of practice — but I still get called upon when the church needs a poster, a banner or a social media graphic. So I know from experience that it isn’t that difficult to put together a sign that has at least a passing acquaintance with the principles of graphic design and avoids glaring mistakes which offend the eyes. Yet I never seem to reach the bottom of the barrel when it comes to what I have labelled Christian Weird. These fifteen examples are all church signs which defy all conventions of logic or common sense. 1 Anyone with the misfortune to step inside a church kitchen will know that churches LOVE plastering the walls with numerous signs telling people where they MUST not transgress. There must be a chapter somewhere in the Old Testament — which I have hitherto missed — containing all these laws passed down from the Heavenly Kitchen… This delicious example of the lack of self-awareness of this particular church's “kitchen ladies” is a delight to the eyes (and the bottom…) 2 Here’s the winner of this month’s saddest church sign board — as the name so carefully chosen for this church comes back to bite them.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

I slowly open my eyes and get ready for the race. No, I’m not training for a marathon, though it often feels like one. Welcome to the morning routine relay of a single working mom. My first lap? Getting dressed. I slip into my best professional attire, eager to conquer the day. All seems well until I notice a tiny handprint on my blazer. Upon closer inspection, I realise it’s a legacy of last night’s spaghetti dinner. With a sigh, I quickly change into plan B attire (or was it C? I’ve lost count). Lap two involves coaxing my little one out of bed. “Five more minutes, mommy!” he mumbles. Those five minutes somehow multiply, and before I know it, we’re in a race against the clock. I arm myself with his favourite cereal and the ever-elusive matching pair of socks. After what feels like a mild workout, he’s dressed, hair vaguely brushed, and somewhat ready to take on the day. As we reach lap four, the real fun begins: the bag hunt. Work bag, check. Kid’s school bag, semi-check (who knows what’s hiding at its bottom). Lunch bags, somewhat check? The number of times I’ve found a forgotten banana or half-eaten sandwich from the previous week is, well, a story for another day. With bags in hand, we’re at the doorstep ready to bolt. Just as I breathe a sigh of relief, a crucial plot twist is unveiled. “Mommy, where’s Mr. Bear?” Ah, the teddy bear. The very soul and essence of my child’s day at school. The next few minutes become a frantic search mission, moving cushions, peering under furniture, and contemplating the existential importance of a stuffed animal. "

The alarm chirps in the distance, the digital cock-a-doodle-doo for the urban life. My initial thoughts are crystal clear: answer emails, draft that report, and yes, remember the 10 AM meeting. But as I swing my feet over the bed, another alarm buzzes — a far more immediate and compelling one. My toddler, with a passion for both early rising and constructive dialogue, stands next to my bed, “Mommy, why is the sky blue?” I might not be a morning person, but when faced with the raw curiosity of a child, even the deepest haze of sleep clears away. “It’s because of the way Earth’s atmosphere scatters sunlight,” I began, the software engineer in me taking pride in factual accuracy. But my mini inquisitor is not entirely convinced. So, we agree to a more acceptable answer: “Because it likes to match your beautiful eyes.” Making it to the coffee machine is a quest in itself. It requires stealth, agility, and the rare ability to answer questions ranging from the existential — “Why do we have toes?” — to the confoundingly specific — “How do the little people inside the TV know what to do?” A quick shower is essential for any semblance of professional readiness. But, this presents its own set of challenges. A bathroom, in the eyes of a young child, is not just a bathroom. It’s a spa, a science lab, a water park. I still wonder how a single rubber duck can lead to an indoor monsoon. Getting dressed is a balancing act too. I need to appear presentable for any unscheduled video calls, yet functional enough to tackle unforeseen toddler-led adventures. It’s a fusion of business-casual and ‘I might have to chase a three-year-old’ athletic wear. Breakfast is a strategic affair. It’s not just about nutrition but negotiations. Today’s debate? Why can’t chocolate chip cookies be a main food group? Amidst the discussion, I sneak bites of my toast, accidentally butter my report, and quickly type an email. The morning commute is a trek from the kitchen to the makeshift home office. It’s three minutes, but it feels like a safari. Dodging toy cars, skipping over lego obstacles (those things hurt), and sometimes, just sometimes, being roped into an impromptu game of hide and seek. "

It’s 8:45 AM on a Tuesday, and I’m armed with a to-do list that’s ambitious enough to make a lesser mortal weep. With a sip of my diligently brewed coffee, I’m about to dive into the first video conference of the day when a pint-sized intruder bursts into the frame, wielding a toothbrush like a magic wand, his face adorned with toothpaste remnants. “Mommy, look, I’m a wizard!” he declares. Welcome to my domain, where boardroom battles and bedtime stories coexist in a delicate balance. I’ve tried the classic early morning routine, waking before the sun graces the sky, sneaking in an hour of uninterrupted work. But as the masters of unpredictability, children have a sixth sense for mom’s movements. My son’s internal alarm is more accurate than the most sophisticated smart home device. The moment I power on my laptop, his eyes flutter open, and our day begins in earnest. It’s a delicate dance, syncing the rhythm of my professional responsibilities with the unpredictable beat of a five-year-old’s heart. The living room, once a place of relaxation, has now been promoted to a multifunctional command center. Here, I negotiate contracts and Lego disputes with equal fervor. The couch, my makeshift office chair, bears the imprint of my ambition and occasionally, a few stray building blocks. In a bid for efficiency, I crafted a schedule that rivals military precision. Yet, children have a marvelous talent for upending plans with the cunning of seasoned generals. For instance, the mute button has become my closest ally, swiftly deployed when the sounds of impromptu drum solos on pots and pans threaten to punctuate financial forecasts. Lunchtime is an exercise in agility, a test of how swiftly one can transition from strategic planner to short-order cook. The kitchen becomes a stage where peanut butter sandwiches are crafted with the expertise of a gourmet chef, all while detailing project milestones. Then there’s the matter of schoolwork, a realm where I’m convinced children are the true professors, and we, the parents, are their diligent students. As I decipher… "

Yes, it’s face paint day at school tomorrow, and no, I hadn’t forgotten. I had it all planned out — finish my report by three, face paint by four, dinner by six, bedtime by eight, and then, if the stars align, a semblance of relaxation before I do it all over again. Sounds simple, right? If only. The report, a meticulous document teeming with data, demands my undivided attention. But as Murphy’s Law would have it, my daughter’s impromptu decision to turn our living room into a Picasso-inspired studio cannot be ignored. There she stands, with the poise of a pint-sized artiste, her eyes gleaming with creative fervor, her hands dangerously close to the face paints — and to my horror, my open laptop. “Sweetie, let’s not mix mommy’s work with your art project,” I gently caution, my eyes darting between the screen and the advancing paintbrush in her hand. Her response, a mischievous giggle, sends shivers down my spine. This isn’t just about keeping my documents free of colorful embellishments; it’s about preserving the last shred of order in my carefully segmented day. My colleagues often say they envy the flexibility of my work-from-home situation, blissfully unaware of the tightrope I walk daily. As I save my document and swiftly close my laptop, the semblance of professional poise gives way to a mom on a mission. The face paints must be corralled, and my daughter’s artistic talents channeled appropriately — and away from my electronics. Shifting from data analyst to art facilitator, I negotiate with my little visionary. “How about we practice your face painting skills on paper first?” The suggestion is met with a moment of consideration before she nods, her enthusiasm undimmed. Crisis averted, I return to my report, the tick-tock of the clock now a mocking reminder of the ticking time bomb of multitasking that defines my life.

The birthday party. How could I forget? What ensues is akin to planning a corporate event, but with a twist. The guest list is more exclusive, the stakes somehow feel higher, and the attendees are less forgiving than any board member I’ve encountered. The venue? Our living room, which must transform into a fantastical realm befitting my child’s latest obsession: dinosaurs. The décor, the entertainment, the culinary spread — all of it must speak to the Mesozoic era. Simple, right? I dive into the world of prehistoric party planning with the same vigor I apply to my tech projects. Logistics, check. Scheduling, check. Risk assessment… well, let’s just say I didn’t account for the Tarbosaurus-sized tantrum about napkins not being the ‘right shade of fossil’. As the week progresses, the lines between my work and party prep blur. During a conference call, I catch myself doodling velociraptors on my notepad. Thankfully, no one asks me to share my screen at that moment. The day before the party, disaster strikes. The custom cake, which was supposed to be the centerpiece of the event, looks less like a fearsome T-Rex and more like a grinning gecko. With no time to reorder, I channel my inner MacGyver and set to work with frosting and fondant. The result? A creature that prompts a laugh from my son and a new dinosaur species name: Mommysaurus. Party day arrives, and it’s a whirlwind of excitement. Children descend upon our home like a flock of Pterodactyls. My multitasking skills are put to the test as I simultaneously play host, DJ, and peacekeeper. Who knew musical chairs could become so competitive? Amid the chaos, there’s a moment of stillness. I watch my son, the birthday boy, surrounded by friends and laughter, and my heart swells. Yes, there’s a mountain of clean-up awaiting me and a week’s worth… "

As I click the link for my morning meeting, I’m thrust into the virtual coliseum where the internet speed is the ultimate gladiator. Will I be the hero with crystal-clear audio, or will I fall victim to the dreaded “unstable connection”? Only time will tell. In the arena of screen-sharing, I navigate the treacherous path between “Share Sound” and “Optimize for Video Clip,” hoping not to accidentally broadcast my not-so-guilty pleasure Spotify playlist. I make a mental note to self: A professional should always have their cat filters disabled, or risk becoming a viral sensation for all the wrong reasons.

I adjust my makeshift stack of books, a pedestal for my laptop, striving for the halo effect of a well-lit face rather than the ominous silhouette of a witness protection program participant. Lunchtime provides no respite, as the kitchen beckons with its siren call. It’s a test of willpower to choose a salad over the leftover pizza that whispers sweet promises of immediate satisfaction. I remind myself that the path to victory is paved with leafy greens, not mozzarella cheese. The afternoon presents its own set of trials.

Bath time was a splashy affair, with more water on the floor than in the tub. Then came the challenge of brushing teeth, which in toddler world translates to eating two-thirds of the toothpaste and painting the bathroom tiles with the rest. *Picasso in the making.* Dressed in her favorite pajamas, adorned with cartoon unicorns prancing in a field of rainbows, we ventured into the treacherous terrain of storytime. This was usually the calm before the storm, a time of peace and quiet. But not tonight. Tonight, every story was met with a critique worthy of a seasoned book reviewer. “Again!” she demanded after the third reading of ‘The Very Hungry Caterpillar’. By the fifth rendition, I wasn’t sure who was hungrier, the caterpillar or my sanity. *Again and again, into the abyss.* The clock struck eight, the witching hour for toddlers and their exhausted parents. I dimmed the lights, hoping to set the mood for sleep. But my daughter, fueled by an unknown source of nocturnal energy, had other plans. She began a one-toddler parade around the room, chanting a song composed of three words she knew well: “No bed, Mommy!” *The anthem of toddler defiance.* I tried everything. Soft lullabies, gentle rocking, pleading with the universe. But she was relentless, a tiny dictator ruling over the night with an iron fist and a refusal to succumb to the sandman’s spell.

And so begins the daily race, not towards some finish line draped in glory, but to an ever-moving target that dances just out of reach. Now, I must say, the concept is fascinating. The very notion that effort can be infinitely scaled up with the simple vocal encouragement of a higher-up is a marvelous thought indeed. It’s akin to believing that a car, upon the driver’s command, might sprout wings and soar into the stratosphere. Yet, despite the impracticality, the command is given, and we, the ever-dutiful workforce, nod and smile, rolling up our sleeves as if to say, “Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?” In the realm of increased effort, there are the strategists. These clever souls nod fervently at the boss’s command, then proceed to rearrange their desk trinkets with a focused intensity that would suggest they’re solving the world’s energy crisis. They are the conductors of the orchestra that plays only for them, turning the mundane shuffling of papers into a performance worthy of an audience.

Just last night, my living room walls bore the unsolicited but artistically fervent strokes of my toddler, who, in a burst of Picasso-esque passion, decided that beige was out and ‘eau de mud pie’ was in. It’s a bold statement piece, I suppose, fitting for any modern art exhibit. I can see it now, “The Essence of Earth: A Study in Textured Finger Painting,” exclusively on my once-pristine walls. And let’s not forget the kitchen, where culinary exploits take on a performance art quality. Who needs plates when you have a perfectly good table to catch your spaghetti splatters? Indeed, my little ones have redefined ‘al dente’ to mean ‘adhering firmly to all surfaces within a three-foot radius of the high chair.’ It’s a fascinating display, one that challenges the very concept of eating as a mere necessity. Moving through the house, I step into what was once a laundry room but now feels more like a battleground where socks are the soldiers and I, the weary general, am perpetually outmaneuvered. My latest strategy involved a tactical retreat to the sofa, but alas, the enemy followed, launching a surprise attack with a barrage of mismatched socks and undershirts. The audacity! Even the bathroom, my once-secure sanctuary, has fallen victim to these mischievous marauders. The sink, a vessel for artistic expression, where toothpaste doubles as paint and the faucet is a source of endless aquatic amusement. It’s a marvel, really, how much water can escape a basin and create a small but spirited lagoon on the floor.

These resources have not only been a source of inspiration but also a practical guide in our family’s unique educational approach. In the early days of our unschooling adventure, when I first decided to move away from conventional education for my children, I often felt overwhelmed. It was uncharted territory for us, and like any new endeavour, it brought with it a healthy share of uncertainties. Parenting books were my first stop — guiding my understanding of child-led learning. One book that particularly resonated with me emphasised the importance of respecting each child’s individual learning pace and interests. This concept struck a chord as I observed my own children thriving when they pursued subjects they were passionate about. This book, among others, reinforced my belief that unschooling could cater to the unique educational needs of my children — something I felt traditional schooling systems were unable to offer. Blogs written by fellow unschooling parents have been another invaluable resource. Reading about other families’ experiences, challenges, and triumphs provided me not only with practical tips but also with a sense of camaraderie. For example, one blog shared a story about how their child’s interest in nature led to an impromptu biology lesson in the backyard. This mirrored our own experiences, where my children’s everyday curiosities often turned into impromptu learning sessions. These blogs helped me realise that unschooling is not a solitary path but a shared experience with a vibrant community of parents and educators. Podcasts, too, have played a significant role in our unschooling journey. They have been like a conversation with a friend, offering both comfort and knowledge. "

However, I soon discovered that everyday items, especially from affordable stores like Kmart, can be invaluable assets in our unschooling environment. It’s easy to underestimate the potential of basic stationery. At a glance, one might only see their conventional uses: pencils for sketching, markers for highlighting, and so on. But when you’re on an unschooling path, the potential of these tools expands exponentially. Kmart’s selection of such materials has proven invaluable in our home, constantly surprising us with their multifaceted uses. One of the most notable moments of creative inspiration was when my son looked at a pack of pencils and saw beyond their basic function. To him, they weren’t just tools for writing or drawing; they became the foundation for his makeshift abacus. With a handful of pencils and some elastic bands, he constructed a counting device that not only served its mathematical purpose but also honed his problem-solving and engineering skills. This simple project reinforced the idea that learning can be both tactile and visual, transcending the limitations of traditional textbook methods. And it wasn’t just the abacus. The versatility of Kmart’s craft materials has repeatedly transformed our learning space. Coloured markers, for instance, became tools for categorising and sequencing during our science experiments. They’ve been utilised for creating visual timelines in (informal) history lessons, and even for marking growth on our homemade height chart. Craft paper, on the other hand, moved beyond just art projects. We’ve used it for mind maps, brainstorming sessions, and even to craft three-dimensional geometric shapes, offering a hands-on approach to understanding complex mathematical concepts. The beauty of these tools lies in their simplicity. They don’t come with a hefty price tag or… "

I’ve written more on this previously, but when we evaluated different educational options, we felt drawn to this method due to its flexibility and the chance it gave us to cater to our children’s unique needs and interests. Amidst the plethora of tools and resources we’ve employed, LEGO and DUPLO have stood out as remarkable aids, not only as toys but as vital instruments for learning and creativity. For decades, these construction toys have been embraced by educators and schools alike — their modularity allows for the development of fine motor skills, while their versatility provides countless scenarios for role-play, storytelling, and even foundational mathematical concepts. In our homeschooling experience, it’s clear to see why these tools have been favourites in classrooms for years. For my own children, they have built not just structures but narratives and imaginative scenarios, highlighting their power not just as playthings but as vehicles for learning. There’s something inherently powerful about physically touching, manipulating, and assembling pieces. The tangible interaction with LEGO and DUPLO bricks facilitates a kind of learning that screen-based or theoretical lessons may not always provide. I’ve noticed a significant difference in my children’s learning when they can touch and interact with their materials. Using LEGO, their hands became tools of exploration, helping them understand the world and the concepts we discuss in a more profound way. LEGO and DUPLO are also good for spatial awareness — that is, visualising patterns, comprehending proportions, and predicting outcomes. With LEGO and DUPLO, children are constantly evaluating and reassessing how blocks of different sizes and shapes can be combined. Not every creation goes as planned either. Sometimes, a structure might be unstable, or a certain piece might not fit where it’s… "

As a parent who has chosen this unconventional approach to education for my family, I can honestly say that the benefits of unschooling are too good not to share. In this article, I’m going to spill the beans on why unschooling is just fabulous, and how it has transformed our family’s life. Whether you’re already part of the unschooling tribe, thinking about it, or just curious, I hope this article will give you some inspiration and laughs. From traveling the world with our kids, to letting them stay in their PJs all day (yep, guilty!), to fostering their love of gaming and tech, we’ve learned that unschooling is all about doing what works best for our family. So, grab a cup of coffee or tea (or wine — no judgement!), and let me tell you about our family’s unschooling journey! As any parent knows, raising children can be a wild ride full of surprises, twists and turns. For my family and I, our unschooling journey began with the realisation that our eldest daughter, a curious and gifted (and still very new) teenager, was not being challenged sufficiently by the traditional school system. Despite attempts to negotiate with the school to push her ahead, it became clear that her potential was not going to be realised and that her boredom risked other challenges ahead. I myself was pushed out of school early because I was bright and the school system lacked the appropriate supports necessary to support and assist someone like me. After leaving in my early teens, and despite the usual nonsense about my “never amounting to anything”, I did in fact go on to achieve a law degree, as well as postgraduate qualifications in my early 20s, notwithstanding the problematic attitudes of these so-called… "

This flexibility allows parents to create a personalised learning experience that caters to their children’s unique needs, interests, and abilities. For example, if your child is passionate about marine life, you can design a curriculum that delves deep into oceanography, marine biology, and environmental conservation. Customised learning experiences lead to a more engaged and enthusiastic student. In our family, my second child has always shown a natural aptitude for math. Recognising his strengths, we tailored his curriculum to nurture his mathematical abilities while also fostering his creativity through art, music, and film making — his other significant passions. Through film making, we discovered a unique way to develop not only his artistic talents but also his writing, reading, and communication skills. As he wrote scripts, planned shots, and directed scenes, he was simultaneously refining his storytelling abilities and enhancing his literacy skills. Additionally, the collaborative nature of film making provided opportunities for him to practice effective communication with others, building strong interpersonal skills. This experience is a testament to the boundless potential of homeschooling, demonstrating just how broad and versatile education can be when tailored to a child’s unique interests and strengths. This personalised approach helped him develop a well-rounded skill set, as well as fostering a genuine love for learning. Another wonderful benefit of homeschooling is the close family bonds it fosters. Parents and siblings become an integral part of the learning process, sharing experiences, and growing together. "

Well, at least that’s what I tell myself as I stare at the newest addition to the fridge gallery — a piece I affectionately call “Mixed Media Mayhem,” courtesy of my three-year-old Picasso-in-training. Today, we’re exploring the uncharted waters of toddler artistry, where the line between ‘abstract art’ and ‘accidental wall redecoration’ is as fine as the hair on a paintbrush. In my past life, I might have strolled through museums, sipping on the subtle notes of an aged red, nodding along to the profound interpretations of art critics. These days, I’m more likely to be found in sweatpants, sipping cold coffee, deciphering the profound interpretations of my toddler’s latest masterpiece. “It’s a… um, a dragon?” I venture a guess. “No, silly! It’s a ‘nake!” she corrects me with a giggle that could melt the coldest art critic’s heart. It all starts with the best intentions: a quiet afternoon, an arsenal of washable paints, and a newspaper-covered kitchen table that looks like a crime scene in waiting. I’m armed with wet wipes and a prayer, hoping that today’s session doesn’t end with a new hair color. The setup is an art form in itself, requiring the strategic placement of paper and ensuring the ‘non-toxic’ label is indeed truthful because, let’s be real, everything ends up in the mouth. As the painting begins, I’m hit with a wave of nostalgia. Remember the days when your greatest worry was staying within the lines? Well, those lines have been crossed, my friends. They’ve been crossed, smeared, and splattered onto every conceivable surface. You haven’t lived until you’ve scrubbed neon green off a cat who thought it was a good idea to nap on the art table. The chaos is palpable, the ‘creative process’ enigmatic. To the untrained eye, it’s a mess. But through the lens of motherhood, it’s a masterpiece unfolding — one that doesn’t require an art degree to appreciate, just a whole lot of love and a little bit of humor. Halfway through, my little artist decides that brushes are passé. Who needs bristles when you have fingers, palms, elbows, and let’s not forget — the nose. Yes, the nose, an underappreciated painting tool, perfect for adding that personal touch to a canvas or, in my case, a freshly cleaned… "

I was navigating through the bustling streets of my city, a mosaic of cultures and histories. As a journalist and an advocate for social issues, my life was a constant exploration of stories often overlooked. On that particular morning, my attention was drawn not to the grandeur of the city, but to the invisible forces that kept it running. My journey into understanding the concept of invisible labor began quite unexpectedly. I had been assigned to cover a story about the working conditions of sanitation workers in our city. The more I delved into their lives, the more I realized how crucial their contributions were and yet, how undervalued they remained. Invisible labor, I learned, is the work that is essential for our society to function but often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. It encompasses a vast range of occupations — from domestic workers to caregivers, from sanitation workers to the people who harvest our food. These jobs, crucial to the backbone of our society, are often the least acknowledged. As a vegan and an animal rights advocate, I saw parallels between the unseen suffering of animals and the often unnoticed struggles of people performing invisible labor. Just like the animals I advocated for, these workers performed tasks that many of us preferred not to think about, yet we depended on them every day. Growing up, I was always conscious of social inequalities and the importance of a universal basic income (UBI) and free higher education. These beliefs stemmed from witnessing the struggles of people around me, people who worked tirelessly yet remained on the fringes of society. My journey into the heart of invisible labor was eye-opening. I spoke to numerous workers, each with their own story of hardship and resilience. There was Maria, a domestic worker who juggled multiple homes to make ends meet, yet was barely able to afford schooling for her children. And then there was Sam, a young man who worked night shifts as a cleaner, dreaming of the day he could return to college. These conversations revealed a world where hard work didn’t always equate to fair compensation or recognition. The more I learned, the more I felt… "

The concept of circling this enormous land with my husband and our three children — our curious four-year-old, our adventurous eight-year-old, and our teenager, wise beyond her sixteen years — gives a heedy sense of excitement, mixed with a respectable dose of realism about the challenges ahead. With our journey’s blueprint currently sprawled across our living room table, with maps annotating potential campsites, wildlife parks, and educational stops that promise hands-on learning experiences unlike any classroom could offer, our excitement only grows. We’ve marked out the terrain, mindful of the lengthy drives and the need to keep young minds and bodies engaged and energised. With a route that winds through remote outbacks and coastal havens, we’ve familiarised ourselves with the local wildlife, the necessary precautions to take, and the best ways to respond to emergencies. Our caravan — a wonderfully renovated 1980s old boy, named “Harvey” — is now a trove of survival guides, snakebite kits, and sunscreens. Transforming our caravan into a mobile home that suits the rugged Australian landscape has been a big task too — approached with practical enthusiasm so as to create a comfortable home on the road. For ourselves, we tore out the old bed to put in something more modern, with a new mattress and lift for creating further storage underneath. Our boys have their beds down the other end, with lap desks and storage nooks for all their individual needs. Our teenager gets his own “room” in a pop up roof top tent on our truck. We’ve also kitted out our set up with a 270 degree awning, which covers a side and back of the truck, where our extra fridge and other camp paraphernalia is stored too. Camp set up is being kept as simple as possible, but we have a Joolca shower tent and gas hot water system that’ll let… "

The sights and sounds of our kitchen speak to the timelessness of culinary arts and the new rhythms of digital discovery. Food has always been more than mere sustenance. It’s a reflection of culture, history, and familial bonds. The dishes we relish are infused with memories, tales, and traditions that span generations. However, with the advent of technology and the ubiquity of ready-to-eat meals, the culinary landscape is undergoing a transformation. As I watch my children navigate this blend of traditional and contemporary culinary techniques, it’s evident that the kitchen has evolved into a space of both tactile exploration and digital discovery. My son, who has developed an affinity for baking, often refers to my grandmother’s handwritten recipes. Simultaneously, my daughter, with her penchant for global flavours, frequently whips out her tablet to watch an online tutorial on crafting the perfect sushi roll or assembling a gourmet salad. This juxtaposition of old and new raises a few questions: How does the digitisation of culinary practices influence our connection to food? In an era where a recipe from a distant continent is just a click away, how do we ensure that our family’s cherished recipes aren’t lost in the shuffle? The influence of digital platforms on our culinary endeavours is undeniable. Websites, blogs, and apps dedicated to gastronomy provide a treasure trove of recipes, tutorials, and insights. The barriers that once limited our culinary experiences are dissolving, replaced by an interconnected network of food enthusiasts eager to share and learn. Yet, amidst this ocean of digital resources, the essence of home-cooked meals and the magic of family recipes shine even brighter. The scent of a stew that has been in the family for generations or the joy of biting into a cookie that tastes of childhood memories — these experiences are irreplaceable.

Coffee in one hand, planner in the other — I’m poised to tackle the week. The peace is punctuated by a small hand tugging at my sleeve, eyes wide with the urgency that only a seven-year-old can muster. “Mom, you won’t forget my party on Saturday, right?” Right. The birthday party. How could I forget? What ensues is akin to planning a corporate event, but with a twist. The guest list is more exclusive, the stakes somehow feel higher, and the attendees are less forgiving than any board member I’ve encountered. The venue? Our living room, which must transform into a fantastical realm befitting my child’s latest obsession: dinosaurs. The décor, the entertainment, the culinary spread — all of it must speak to the Mesozoic era. Simple, right? I dive into the world of prehistoric party planning with the same vigor I apply to my tech projects. Logistics, check. Scheduling, check. Risk assessment… well, let’s just say I didn’t account for the Tarbosaurus-sized tantrum about napkins not being the ‘right shade of fossil’.

It’s a mission, a gamble, a twist of fate ready to unfold. So there I was, list in hand, hopeful heart in chest, venturing into the suburban wilderness known as the local mini mart with my toddler, affectionately nicknamed ‘Chaos Conductor’, in tow. A prime setting for a survival reality show. The mission was simple: get milk. The reality? A labyrinth of candy displays, toy aisles, and a toddler with the negotiation skills of a seasoned diplomat. As I pushed the cart through the narrow aisles, I practiced breathing techniques and muttered affirmations that I barely believed. As Chaos Conductor serenaded the frozen food section with her latest hit single, “I Want That! No, That!”, my will to live danced on the edge of a knife. That’s when I heard it — a giggle, as pure and carefree as a mortgage-free existence. I turned to see an elderly man watching us, his eyes crinkling in amusement. “You’ve got your hands full,” he said, the universal code for “I see you’re seconds from unraveling but I’ll pretend this is normal.” Do you also see I’m one ‘I want’ away from a public meltdown? “Yes, she’s… spirited,” I said, the parent code for “Send help.” Chaos Conductor, now attempting to climb out of the cart to reach a box of sugar incarnate, forced me to abandon all pretense of control. I plucked her from the cart, abandoning my list — milk forgotten — and decided to flee. But not before she grabbed a chocolate bar, holding it aloft like a trophy. The elderly man chuckled, a sound that was either empathy or relief that he was past this stage. “You’ll miss these days,” he said. Like I’ll miss a toothache. I smiled, Chaos Conductor smiled, the chocolate bar did not. It was a standoff in aisle three, with an audience of one. With a sigh, I added the chocolate to my basket. The man nodded as if acknowledging a battle well fought, and I couldn’t help but feel like I’d just been inducted into some sort of parental hall of fame. Or shame. It’s a thin line. "

We don’t have a ton of options as far as getting last minute help watching the baby, so we had to get creative. I realize that many people may not have this option in their areas, but I am more so encouraging parents to get creative! We started researching ways to go on a “date” that was fairly baby friendly. It ends up that there is a drive-in movie theater right where we live on the beach! We had absolutely no idea that this was there, and I have lived here my whole life! We weren’t sure how it would be taking Noah, our 6-month-old son along with us, but we were going to give it a shot to find out! They were playing the new Jurassic Park movie and tickets were $5 per head, can’t beat that. This particular drive-in theater plays two different movies, one at 8:30pm and the other starting right after at 10:30pm. The sun hadn’t set completely during the previews but once the movie started, the sunset disappeared and the stars came out. It was perfect! I cooked dinner ahead of time and packed it in little containers so that we could eat it when we arrived. My recommendation is definitely to eat before you leave because while eating in the car during the movie is fun, if you have a little one it can be tough, especially if you are starving! Michael had just come from working out and we were pressed for time but we made it work! Luckily Noah was asleep for the first 30 minutes of the movie from the car ride alone. That made it easy for us to eat real quick but the whole time Michael and I were saying to each other “hopefully he keeps sleeping just a few more minutes!” as we scarfed down our food. Not long after we finished, Noah woke up. I quickly grabbed him from his car seat and brought him up to the driver’s seat with me. After I fed him, he was pretty content. He was fascinated with the sound of the movie coming out of the speakers and the projection light all the way to the big screen. Here and there we were able to sit him down on the center console between us and he would watch. But for the most part we took turns propping him up on our laps to watch the movie. It definitely wasn’t movie theater, child-free, date night comfortable, but it was fun, and we needed it! And believe it or not, we can’t wait to do it again! Like I said, neither of us had any idea that we even had a drive-in theater! So if you are itching for a date night and have a baby, don’t get discouraged if you can’t find a sitter. Get on the internet and find out what your city or county has to offer, I bet you there are quite a few things available that you may have never thought about as an option, or better yet, never knew existed! *Note about the pics: We are the jerks with the headlights on I jumped out of the car right when we got there while other cars were still paying to get in and the previews were running so that I could snap some pics before it got too dark. Lights were off seconds later! How did you like this parenting Advice? I would love to hear all about your crazy date nights with a baby or a child! "
https://medium.com/@Parentingtip2go/feed-me-im-yours-breast-vs-formula-9c1aff9b615?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"I am about to be judged. I am ok with that, if my story can help just one mom struggling with her feeding decision. Breastfeeding mothers of the world, prepare yourselves for what I am about to share. I chose not to breastfeed. WHAT? Don’t worry, I can hear your collective gasp, and all I can think in my head is … why judge? Why are we judging a mother’s choice on how she feeds her child? Before you decide I am unworthy of being on the planet, or even calling myself a mother, STOP! Let me share with you why I made that choice for my child(ren) and myself. As long as I could remember, I wanted to be a mother. Turns out, I had to really really want to be a mother, as I miscarried seven times before my first child was born. I was pregnant thirteen times to eventually having the sheer joy of mothering four. When my firstborn arrived, I had just completed a marathon 40-week throw-up session. I was sick all day, every day for nine months. It turns out that growing a baby is not something my body enjoys, and I have an adverse reaction. By the time she was born, I was clinically malnourished. She literally took every good bit of me for herself, and I was more than happy to give it to her. After 7 miscarriages, it was the very least I could do for a healthy outcome. So, it was not because I am selfish or not mothering enough. My body needed to heal. The perfect formula was available, and so it was what I nourished my child with. I had a trick that I used exclusively with my first born. Only I fed her for her first three months. Just mom and baby settled in, and away she went. We made eye contact, she felt the warmth and smell of mom, and she knew my voice, and that I her mother would be the sole nurturer for those first twelve weeks of life. It was beautiful, and I would not change that decision for anything. She was healthy, and I recovered from my pregnancy. Turns out, I needed that recovery period, because a mere 12–16 weeks later, our second daughter was on her way. I was pretty sick again but managed because I had to. I had an infant to care for. When I was 7 plus months pregnant with Alexandra, I was in a horrible car vs. Mack truck car accident on the freeway. The truck driver was at fault. I was the only one injured out of the 3 other adults and one baby in the car, and one in the womb. My left shoulder broke the driver side window. That is how hard I hit. Alexandra safely arrived two months later, and I was immediately treated with powerful narcotics and anti-inflammatory drugs to ease the pain of what was a torn rotator cuff. The doctors were not 100 percent sure of the what effect if any the drugs would have on my milk, but I was not taking any chances. I chose not to breastfeed. Not only did my body need to heal from the constant throwing up, but needed to recover from a horrible accident. The Same protocol followed in that I was the sole provider of feedings for my newborn daughter. Two years later, another daughter arrived. Sadly, she also died six hours later. Stephanie was born with Trisomy 18, which is an extra chromosome, and although chances of survival have improved today, babies like Stephanie rarely survive. I really thought my baby days were over, but four years later, Sabrina arrived, and one year and one week later, our last baby Steven. My pattern of extreme sickness ensued, and some other health factors were added to the equation. Once again, I enjoyed that exclusive mama feeding, which I believe is the greatest gift of motherhood. That one on one uninterrupted time with the brand new baby. Sabrina is just completing her freshman year of college, and Steven is graduating from high school in a few short weeks. They are also happy and healthy with brilliant futures ahead of them. Choosing breastfeeding, or choosing formula is highly personal, and should not be judged either way. The newest trend of pumping and bottle feeding baffles me. But again, it is highly personal. I am sure these women have their reasons, and really believe it is best for their babies. I would argue otherwise. This is where parenting wars escalate. Who is right? Who could say? Does formula feeding cause autism? Or is it environmental, and therefore passed through breast milk? Google that question, and you will find hundreds of thousands of thoughts. In one essay, the author seeks to blame formula. And yet, every comment refers to a child that was breastfed and is still autistic. There is no answer. Be gentle with your fellow moms and their choices. Everyone has a story, and their reasons might surprise you. No parent is a failure who nourishes and cares for their child. We are all in this together. What is most important is the overall well being of your individual family unit. I will support your decision either way. "

Parents are dreaming dreams for their kids, that the kid may just not qualify for, or even want! Middle of February, through March, is the time across America that high school seniors receive definitive admission answers from colleges and universities. All through March, and April 1, the cell phone buzzes, the e-mail arrives, and the snail mailbox is stuffed full. The “Yippee”, the “Wahoos”, and the painful tears from rejections. For some, they are a tad more relaxed because they have already been accepted to the school of their dreams, and this part is merely ceremonial. At least, you would think. And then it happens. Your perfect child who did everything right hears via e-mail, text message, and snail mail that they are just not the right fit for such and such school. Most schools are kind, and the guy that signs his name on the bottom of the letter understands the power he wields when he rejects your perfect specimen of a child. So he or she is gentle. Your work, your resume, and your involvement have not gone unnoticed by our admissions committee.

Harvard is a classy place, and they know it. They let you down gently. At least, you applied… And then the next envelope is opened, and again the rejection letter is read. This time, you want to call personally the very mean-spirited admissions director for their choice of words. Whereas your 4.2 GPA is impressive, unfortunately, you are just not up to the caliber of the students we admit to our school. We wish you luck in your educational endeavors. This last one seems extreme, but it truly was the words on of my second daughter’s rejection letters. And believe it or not, it was not IVY, nor a top-tier. That was one of those letters that when you read it, you could feel the sting of the imaginary slap across your face. Lucky for her, she had already been given a very lucrative financial package at the school of her second choice. Although her first choice had gently let her down and offered her ways of transfer, this last letter was from a school barely on her radar. So that brings us to the question that looms. Did she give less of herself in the application process to this school? They could tell it was not her best, and so they let her have it, in the rejection letter? Who can know? When it comes to the rejection, it is important to be present for your child. Let them speak when they want to. Don’t expect them to come right out with feelings or thoughts. They may not even know how they feel at the moment. What is important, is to encourage and support, and let them know that many great colleges exist in the world, and just because the school comes with a big name, does not mean it is the best fit. The hard part of the whole process is if your kid attends a college prep high school, where admittance to top tier colleges is king. It is on the school campus itself that the pressure is toughest. There are shouts of ” I got into UCLA… I got into Princeton… I got into USC… I got into Johns Hopkins…” And with each new shout of a bigger and better acceptance come the oohs and aahs of adoration. Some real, some from defeat and sheer envy, even from adults who remember too well in their life this first week of March. For parents that wield their children’s successes in everyone’s face, it is in poor taste to write on your car windows… “My kid just got into Stanford…and yours didn’t…” Fast forward to June when the high school diploma is handed out. Everyone dissipates with promises of never forgetting one another and being BFF’s until the end of time. And a week or so later, reality sets in, and all of the accolades of a perfect high school career go into a memory box, and we set out to start new again. In my house, neither daughter got the first choice in their quest for college admittance. But what did we know? Our physics major got into a top ten school for that major, and our film major got into the number two for her major. They both turned out to be perfect fits for their undergraduate years. Neither university sports huge money-making sports teams, or Greek societies on the front page of scandal making news. Parties abound, but it is not their thing. It seemed such a let down on March 1st and 2nd, but it turned out to be a tremendous gift. Like perfectly tailored clothes, both girls headed into their respective dorms with confidence that they would succeed. And so far… so good! We went through this grueling process two years in a row. We survived, and I know you will as well. "
https://medium.com/@Parentingtip2go/a-molested-child-my-story-37592fda07d4?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"I think the best movie of the year should go to Spotlight. Uncovering the heinous crimes of Priests against children, Boston was first to set the Catholic Church free to heal and admit to the sins of its Priests. We as a nation have a problem and those of us that were victims need to stand up. We need to be the voices that bring justice to those who harm children. Teachers, both male and female are accused of molestation, and make headlines across the country. It was the story of Jerry Sandusky a while back that brought it all back for me. When the story first broke about Penn State football defensive coordinator Gerald “Jerry” Sandusky, and his alleged molestation of children, my mind immediately went back in time to when as a young child… I was molested. I think of the children that are victims, and the pain they will face in the back of their consciousness for the rest of their lives. Sure, they won’t live with the deceit 24 hours a day, but the “bruise” on the soul stays with you, and is just beneath the surface of life to make up the individual the child becomes. They can go one of two ways… one of a destructive life, hurting themselves and those around them, any way they can, or like me, they can create a protective wall around them, where the screen is always up, and a heightened sense of fragility prevails where the wrong tone of voice, or choice of words, can leave me in tears. It took me many years to trust men outside of my father and brothers. I was about 3–4 at the time. Just around the corner on Emerald Place, I was playing in the backyard of a neighborhood friend. Growing up in the 60’s — 70’s in a small town, a child of that age could just walk the 15 or so houses without accompaniment, or perhaps I was delivered to the house by a sibling. That detail does not seem to matter. I was in the backyard, playing on the jungle gym. For whatever reason, I have totally blocked out who I was with, or why I was there. Recently, through the open walls of Facebook, the last name surfaced (a rare name), and it is of a woman that would be my age, that grew up in my town. Maybe it was she that I was playing with that day. Anyway, as I played in my dress and pigtails gleefully in the backyard, an older brother (of whomever I was playing with) of about 18 came to the backyard, and summoned me, as he wanted to show me something. I do not recall other adult supervision, as perhaps he was it. He led me to his room, which I can still visualize in the typical tract home model of the day. He said he wanted to show me something, and without missing a beat, he sat with his hand holding his erect penis for my inspection. “Isn’t it pretty? “ he asked. “Come over and touch it”, and with that, he pulled my hand over to stoke him. Following a few moments of stoking he put my head to his penis and instructed me to lick it just like a lollipop. I am not sure what ensued next, as with most children of molestation a bit of blacking out takes place. Or a fog. Who rightly knows? Either way, by the time I went back to the backyard, and climbed the jungle gym, it was with the biggest voice I could muster, that I screamed the “F” word. I am not sure how I came up with that, or why that was the word of choice, but it sure worked. With that shrill little voice came one angry brother from my house. The second oldest, and 8 years older than me. He came and grabbed me by the hand and dragged me faster than my pigtails could fly. I was in BIG TROUBLE for having such a mouth! Fine by me. A spanking ensued, and I never spoke of what happened on Emerald Place that day. The pond scum who took my innocence told me not to. Instead, I built my glass wall of protection. I call it glass, because you could see me. I could see you, but I was not letting you in. No one. EVER! At that point in life, I felt alone. Alone in a big family of 13, to parent myself. I sprained my arm as a preschooler and told no one. In elementary school, I bled so much from my nose once, that I soaked a bath towel. All without telling anyone. This is what molested children do. They go into a world all their own, because you feel alone. If no one would save me then, then I would always just protect myself. It is not that the parents don’t care. They don’t know! It is what children do to protect themselves. The years that followed were difficult. I was a beautiful little girl with raven black hair, creamy white skin dotted with freckles, and sapphire blue eyes. Men were always patting me on the head, or making comments about the beauty I was. What I did was ignore them at all costs. A lovely older gentleman just two doors down, was always so nice to me, but what I did to avoid him, was cross the street to pass his house. I was not rude, but I would not talk to him either. He could be just like the guy around the corner. If a male teacher were to touch my shoulders, I stiffened. It remained so, to early adulthood. Men in authority or perceived authority got to see me only through the glass wall. My guard was always up. I was always cautious with dads of friends, and any man in general. And then I turned 11. My walls were up, and I remained safe, until it happened AGAIN! At 11 years old, my parents sent me on what they thought was the chance of a lifetime. A trip around the world on a 32 foot sailboat. That story is for another time. But, it is in getting to the first leg of the trip that my story of molestation continues. At LAX in 1973 or 1974, the glory days of flying. I boarded Pan Am as an unaccompanied minor to PagoPago, American Samoa, to meet up with the people I would spend the next 15 months of my life with. The first leg of the trip was perfect, and I even sat in Operations with Pilots and Crew in Honolulu as we waited for the next leg of the trip. They were all so attentive, seeing to my ever need. Even gifted me with the Pan Am blue travel bag! On board my flight, I was seated with a native Samoan in his early 20’s. Not a big man, but he seemed pleasant enough as we chatted about where I was going, and why, and how exciting to be embarking on such an adventure. The travel had been long, and as I slept beneath the Pan Am issued blanket, I woke a bit startled as I realized something was up my skirt. And there it was. The Samoan man sitting next to me, thought to take advantage of this young child travelling alone, and his hand made its way up my thigh to a place no strangers hand belongs. I immediately awoke, gathered my self, and threw off the blanket. Without a word, I pushed the button for the Stewardess. Still in the glory days of flying, the beautiful PanAm Stewardess (in this time reference, they were Stewardesses) came to me with that big helpful smile, and with one look at my face knew something was not right. The perportrator looked at me with such evil, that I knew I was not to say a word. So very far away from home, I lied and I told the Stewardess, that I did not feel well and was queasy. She took immediate action; so as to understand what might be wrong with me. I must have been white as a sheet. The idiot next to me looked at her as if he had no idea what was up, then looked back at me with pure evil. The Stewardess was concerned, and offered to walk me up to the bulkhead, where she could keep a better eye on me, and maybe I would feel better. I gladly gathered my things and moved forward. The crew had been with me since Los Angeles, and they were extremely protective of this unaccompanied minor travelling so far from home. I don’t know if she knew what occurred, as I somehow blocked that. I do know that when the plane landed, I was first off, and was escorted to the people waiting for me. What happened after that? I built a bullet proof wall of glass around me, so that no one would get through. I was to be the perfect girl that says yes, obeys, and stays out of the way. I never complained once on that trip around the world. The most miserable time of my life, and yet I never complained. In my minds eye as a child, I felt that it must have been my fault. Or … this is normal. It happens to everyone. I don’t know. I just knew it was my secret shame, and one I would share with no one. This is the first time I have told this story in its entirety. As a mother, I can only wish I could scoop up that little child, and protect her, and tell her all would be well. Instead, I made it my mission to care for children, and keep them out of harms way. Away from corrupt adults who say and do terrible things to children. As a parent, I never give blind faith to any organization. I feel for these young boys who had no way out. Just like private time with a Priest back in the day, as a kid, you have made it to the big leagues when you get to hang with such a prominent name at Penn State. And that is where my feathers go up. If it seems too good to be true, it is. A child should never have time alone like this. These children showed signs. No one payed attention (or perhaps turned a blind eye), until finally it came to light. Those who know Sandusky personally don’t want to believe he may be a bad man. How does a boy shower in a locker room with a grown man, go home, and no one knows? Sandusky admitted to touching and showering with boys, but said he was not a pedophile. Clearly the man is delusional and needs serious help. Either way, the story will continue to unfold, and in the wake will be damaged boys trying to make sense of their lives. I got myself out, in both situations, but at what cost? I lost my childhood. The bruised soul remains. If an adult wants to spend an unusual amount of one on one time with your child, proceed with caution. There are signs. Listen to your gut, and most of all listen to your children. In telling my story, I can honestly say… The truth has set me free. Originally published at www.thefineartofparenting.com. "

I bet some days my kids are like “please get out my room with all that “I’m so sorry I yelled and I’m reading this book and watching that YouTube video to help me.” 🙌🏾 But what I love most about me apologizing to my. children, is that they copy that behavior. They are able to process their feelings and apologize when they feel they’ve wronged someone. And I’ve also thought them that, even if they don’t feel they are wrong, the fact that someone expresses that they are hurt, say something like “I’m sorry you are hurting or I’m sorry that you’re upset, I hope you feel better soon.” That’s the magic ✨ "

Now as a mom, half the time I don’t know what I’m supposed to feel when I act that way towards my children. When I’m kind and loving and soft, sometimes I don’t know how to feel but then I see the smiles on their faces, the warmth from their embraces and their kindness towards each other and I know that I’m doing something right. There are days I’m not so kind, I’m not so respectful and those days I apologize to them and most importantly I find the empathy in my heart to forgive myself. I am the parent of respectful, loving and kind children and for that, I myself must always, first, continue to practice being respectful, kind, and loving to my children. "

Now, WHY is that? Is it because it’s too hard to do? NO. I don’t believe that it’s too hard to do, because people do harder things. I believe, that it’s because we are not thought to: Be Rich, be happy, have peace, or be in relationships with love I think it’s because most of us believe that things like that are just supposed to happen. We think “life is just supposed to happen.” WE COULDN’T BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH When we are born, life happened. After that, LIVING, that’s a whole different thing. We MUST DESIGN the life we want to LIVE. Then we must DO What it Takes to live that life.

https://medium.com/@vidaforward/your-thoughts-are-killing-your-life-2e02a5673eda?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"It’s the hardest thing for most people to believe. “How can my own thoughts be killing me? What are you talking about?” Ex: Your spouse forgets to get you a birthday 🎂 card or a card for any other special day that’s important to you. That forget should be as simple as “love one forgot card, I’ll like to have a card so I’ll focus on him getting me a card.” And Yes, even if he has forgotten for the 100th time, it still should be discussed as “I’m hurt you forgot ___.” Instead, usually, this is what most of us women thoughts do to us. “what an asshole, he always forgets everything. Why does he always do this to me. How is that love? Does he even really love me? I’m so over this shit. Gosh, why is he so mean. I don’t ask for much, just to be nice to me but he always forgets what’s important to me.” The interesting part is, all that conversation has taken place in our thoughts and most times, it all happened within less than 5mins. Hands up if you know what I’m talking about 🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋‍♀️😂 Here’s the deadly part. Because you’ve poisoned yourself with all those horrible thoughts, you become not only hurt but angry and resentful as well. Your thoughts 💭 have made you create all this anger and anxiety, which causes stress, and stress is one of the leading, deadly cause of deases and death around the world. What if I told you that most of the things we think about every day is not completely accurate. In fact, our thoughts are just imaginary things of what our brain is telling us. And while there’s nothing wrong with that, the problem happens when most of us tend to live in our thoughts instead of in our bodies. We make our thoughts reality and that becomes the self-deadly-weapon that destroys our lives. The birthday card situation can be applied to every part of your life. When something doesn’t go as expected, Do-Not-Think, Process. Write down only what happened and then write down what you can do to make yourself feel better about what happened. And that’s it. 💯 "

When I write that the act of knowing yourself is your first true love, it’s because it is. You and all of your ugliness, all of your weirdness, all of your beautifulness, all of what you are and what you have yet to discover is what you need to put into practice of loving. When you love all of you, flaws and all, you start to shape and create yourself into the you that you like. And you will do this based on what you love and know true about you not based on what others say and think of you.

Just like it’s ok to be soft spoken if that’s how you are” The thing is, you’ve got to know when and where to use yourself for the good of every one. At a library, I’ll be soft spoken but in my home I’m not always that way. Just like some soft spoken people have places where they too might have to speak out loud. I love that you recognized a part of me sweetie and it’s ok, you don’t have to whisper it.” She looked at me like I had lost my damn mind. And then she said, “But I thought people who talk loud are rude.” And I replied, “No my darling, they not. They are just as un-rude as people who speak soft”. I prayed that I thought her that it’s ok to be proud of the things that people think are imperfect about you. 🙌🏾 And I give myself a high-five for continuing to accept that who I am, bold, loud, crazy, risk taker, is also just splendid.

https://medium.com/alx-africa/break-into-software-engineering-learning-hacks-d6777a10dbd4?source=collection_home---------0----------------------------,"“How to become a software developer in 4 weeks” is one of the many available catchy titles of videos and articles available on the internet. As a starter, you may be curious if such a thing is actionable, or rather as easy as it appears to be. The answer is yes and no. Continue reading this article to find out why. (Please note that this article refers to Software developers and engineers as one thing.) The journey to being a software developer/engineer is an interesting one that is fully dependent on practice, persistence, and understanding ability, among other important virtues. Some people can make it from nooby to a junior developer in a few months, some may take years. This article is meant to catalyze and smoothen your journey from now to your first role. The techniques, methods, and ideas mentioned here are a product of my experience, experimentation, and research on this topic. Grab a pen and notebook, and have fun reading. Talk to your inner self, have a hearty dialogue, and confirm if you are willing to be a software engineer. With a few clicks on the internet, you can get all the information you need to know about being a developer, its advantages, and its disadvantages. Are you willing to be a specimen of that lifestyle? If you do, then you are one step closer to your goal. Many developers have stunted learning progress because they are not motivated to grow in their profession. They magically found themselves in the class because it was a free Bootcamp or maybe they want to be like their well-paid coding friends. When your heart accepts to be a software engineer and when it is aware of what is in store for it, it will be armed to face and conquer all the possible learning challenges that will probably come along. In the ancient days when Google Maps was not yet born, travelers used to have paper maps. As they are gathering their belongings to set for their journey, they would also be analyzing the possible safe routes to their destination on the map. All through their journey, they will be confirmed if they are on the right route. When darkness meets them on the way, they will set up tents and shelter so that they can continue with their expedition the following day. The story above is a close analogy of your learning journey. The map you need is your syllabus or list of concepts or frameworks or things that you need to learn to achieve a specific end goal which is your destination. During your learning, you may experience blockers/hiccups that will hinder you from progressing, you will have to think of solutions and keep moving forward. Software development is a very wide field, and the only way to be an expert in it is to specialize. Find a specialty of your interest and use the internet to find an appropriate journey map for yourself. If you’re part of a Bootcamp, the journey map is already defined for you as the curriculum. Use your journey map to source materials you want to use to learn. Some people prefer books (like me), others prefer articles, others prefer youtube videos, others prefer video courses….what about you? Then plan your study times. An hour every day is fine. It’s also okay if you choose to learn for longer hours, you can adapt to learning techniques that can make you productive throughout your study session. Practice as you learn. Software development needs extensive hands-on practicality. The more code you type, the more programs pass/fail, and the more you experience, and the more you learn. Be consistent in your learning and practice, that is how mastery is manufactured. Teamwork teaches essential communication and social skills, such as active listening and effective speaking. When working as a team, you learn how to listen and participate effectively. With a team, you learn how to listen to one another and share opinions in order to function as a cohesive unit. Teamwork is a very important soft skill in the work environment, and also one that needs a little extra effort when studying/working remotely. There is a world beyond your study circle, where people learn about more interesting and complicated stuff that you too will enjoy. Won’t you like to join them? When normal people meet in TikTok to dance, we gather in TechTok to have fun. TechTok is a collection of TikTok content created and managed by people in technology like me and you. Another place to meet with devs is in TechTwitter hashtag. Which is just a timeline of tech tweets. It is through Twitter that I met wonderful personalities like Eddie Jaoude (the GitHub Star), Danny Thompson, Kacie, etc who I have learned so much from. There are also open Discord Servers and Slack workspaces that you can join to network with other devs. After a period of you following your journey map to learn and practice, take some time and look at your progress. Are you improving? Are you enjoying the learning? Are you heading in the right direction towards your end goal? It is important to award yourself if your progress is impressive. If it is not, you can take this time to amend your plans and make the necessary changes that can help you improve. Seek advice from a mentor or peer if you see necessary. Knowing a certain concept/framework/language is not enough, the real test is to implement the knowledge in a project. Continuously test yourself by building real-world programs, games, and solutions however dumb or useless they may seem. E.g building a tic-tac-toe web app will teach you a lot of CSS and JavaScript that you couldn’t have learned better as individual concepts. Beyond improving your ability to learn the material, teaching others can also lead to additional benefits, such as improved communication skills, increased confidence, and improved leadership ability. Here is a study conducted to prove this. Most developers use Linux operating system. Why do they periodically update and upgrade their packages? Software updates provide new and improved functionality while addressing existing issues, such as bugs and crashes. As a developer, you also need to update and upgrade yourself with the latest frameworks, improve on your weak points, and refurbish your skills. This culture will keep you fresh in the market for the long run. I hope the tips I have shared help you become a better software engineer. Till next time, happy learning :) "

Many of the applicants did not make it to admission (again I say it was a tough process) In partnership with Holberton Inc, alx offers us this program among other programs that you can learn more about here. A.K.A a no-teacher institution. They have a special mode of learning, learning by/for/with peers they call ‘The Holberton Way’. Most people wonder how a school can function without a teacher, but I realized that a peer himself is the best teacher there can be. When two or more students come to learn together, it is the best masterclass experience that I have come to learn and embrace. Being in this software engineering program is an exceptional experience for me (and most other peers as well) but as the application experience, it comes with its own claims too. One of the challenges being meeting the project deadlines and keeping up to speed with the learning. With no teacher, no class, no library, (like a typical school) it becomes hard for us to learn and implement the skills in the hands-on projects availed to us through the school’s intranet. I have established learning techniques and implemented them on myself to better my learning experience (it was hard at first to find out what worked for me and what did not), I now have a working plan that I believe will work for you as well if you try it. Doing the projects on time to meet the deadlines is one thing, and grasping the project’s concepts is another. As a student, you have to be truthful to yourself and distinguish between the two. In the end, the grades are what it takes to sustain you in your spot in the program. As you are reading through this, it will be best if you note down the key points. Open the day’s project and go through it real quick. See everything but do not respond to anything (even if you know the correct response) This step will help you identify the key concepts that you should learn on that day. You will also have a clue of the questions asked in the pre-projects quizzes. Go through the Concepts and Resources given in the project. Keenly read through the referenced materials and take notes of every new concept learned. In some projects, both the Concepts and Resources sections will be available, while in some only the Resources section will be there. Read and understand everything. If there is something that you think you need more explanation on, write it somewhere in your notebook, you will research more about it later. Scan the General concepts that you should have understood. Mark the concepts that you are confident in and note on those that you feel you need more clarification. Make sure that you can respond to all the General questions well. Use The Feynman Learning Technique to perfect your understanding. In summary, Feynman’s Technique is all about explaining the concepts that you have learned in simple words, either by speech (to a rubber duck) or on a whiteboard (pen and paper). Doing so will increase your understanding (keep in mind that you cannot explain what you do not know. If you get yourself stuck in between, go back to the resources and relearn.) You may choose to write the General concepts down on paper to track your understanding closely well. Mark those that you can explain well, and research more on those that you need more details. Rubber-duck-debugging works best for me (I use sponge-droid though). This great man is a superb listener and the best teacher too — best debugging buddy. Do the pre-project quiz Most of the projects have a pre-project quiz. You should get all the questions correctly before you get access to the day’s main project. Most learners find it very hard to do this pre-quiz simply because the checker marks all the questions at once (and they respond to all the questions at once). If you respond to all the pre-quiz at once and run checker, it will be very difficult for you to locate the errors if you got it (if not, good for you). I have a quick tip for you on how you can easily do the pre-project quizzes. Doing this is way easier because you can locate the errors and find a solution to them. You may have noticed that if you respond to all the questions at once and then when you submit in case an error arises you will/may have no idea which question you answered wrongly. Confirm the project’s requirements Not all projects have requirements specifications. If the day’s project has it, follow the procedure well and set your system to the required standards. Do not do the project without completing the requirements stage. If you have any problems, reach out to your peers for help. Start doing the project’s tasks by reading the first question. Understand what the question is asking of you. It will be better if you can locate which concept the question demands from you. If it is a coding question, go ahead and pseudo-code your response on pen and paper. Read the question again and go through your code several times to make sure that your code sufficiently replies to the question asked. Counter check if your response meets the requirements of the project, if yes, proceed to write and debug your code. If checker is available, use it to prove your code correct before you move to the next question. This thorough series of steps should take you to the right answer, in case they don’t, take a deep breath and say hi to your rubber duck (sponge-droid or anything dumb that you can imagine of). Read the question again and try to explain the question to the rubber duck aloud. Then walk your rubber duck through the solution that you have previously written. Be bold and say everything out loud in the simplest language possible (assume the rubber duck is a 10-year-old kid who just has a handful of vocabulary). When you do that, you are most likely to find out the mistake you made and rectify it. Explaining things out loud is a way to reinforce your understanding of the same thing. Describing your code out loud will enable you to spot the semicolon that you mistakenly forgot to place (or any error). My best debugging buddy is a good boy specialized in that field. In case rubber-duck debugging cannot solve your issue as well, you can try to reach out to your first consultation office, which is your squad. All peers are categorized into groups of about 20 individuals named as squads. So reach out to them via your slack channel (preferably by text message) and tell them your issue. Be concise on your problem. Mention the name of the project that you are stuck on, the question number, and the methods that you have previously used in your unsuccessful trials. Your squad will be there to help. In case your squad wasn’t able to help, go to your second consultation office, your tribe/cohort. All peers are categorized into groups of about 200 peers named tribe/cohort. Reach out to them in your cohort slack channel and describe your issue as you previously did with your squad. 200 heads are better than 20 (your squad) and are obviously better than 1 (yours alone). Your cohort/tribe will be there to help. This series of consultation offices should sort out your issue fast enough. In case they do not, the last consultation office is the #ask_alx_team slack channel. Describe your issue there as well. The technical mentors (and other peers) will be there to help you. Once your issue is solved, note the mistake that you did and write them down so that you do not repeat them next time. Then proceed with the other questions similarly. When you are done with the mandatory tasks, open the advanced tasks (if any) and do them in a similar manner. PS: The process is simpleread_question > understand > pseudocode > test_code > debug > run_checker A similar approach is mentioned in the intranet concepts as The Framework. Go through your project again. Ensure that all checks are running correctly.Ensure that your project is marked 100% done (or sometimes 200% if you have completed all the advanced tasks available) Run checker for all the questions and make sure that all checks run correctly.Double-check it again and again. Go over the slack channels This is not a mandatory part of the project, but I consider it suitable behaviour for a great learner. Finishing the day’s project means that you have understood the concepts and you are in a position to help other peers who need your help. However, helping them does not mean giving them direct correct answers to the projects, it means serving them with leads that will get them to the correct answers. Leads help learners to understand on their own while direct answers will just make the peer pass checker for that moment and never in the future. Always help with leads, not direct answers. Move through the slack channels and be there for those who need your help. See the challenges other peers faced and how they solved them. There is no harm to learn more and be hungry for more knowledge.A little motivation here and there won’t be bad either, encourage other peers to keep moving — it’s always a sweet feeling. Prepare for the next project. Read ahead following the week’s schedule. Be ready to do hard things. Try the tips above and tell me your experience in the comments section. I have gathered some motivational videos to help keep you on track. Enjoy them. "

There are several reasons which cause the high price of the cars. Here is the reason which affects the prices of the automotive sector in Pakistan. The biggest reason is the Currency Rate. Over the last couple of years, the value of the Pakistan rupee to other countries, especially the USD has decreased significantly which affected the prices of cars. The devaluation of PKR results in higher import costs such as shipping charges for car manufacturers for importing cars from one country to another. The second reason is the Inflation rate. It is important to know what the Inflation rate means. Decrease in purchasing power as the increase in the prices of goods and services. Pakistan’s auto industry assembles cars in Pakistan by importing car parts and accessories. The government often charges high imports in Texas and Duties on Auto parts so an increase in prices of imports in Texas and duties results in making them more and more expensive prices of cars. Another major reason for the rise in the prices of cars in Pakistan is the rise in raw material prices. Pakistan imports auto parts and accessories from Asian countries. From the previous year, the price of raw materials has more than doubled this year. The cost of production and transporting automobiles has gone up due to the high value of raw materials prices. The laborers who are working in companies need salaries so companies are managing it from the customers who are buying cars, so this also increases prices. The automotive market has been forced to raise the prices of their vehicles again due to the increase in the cost of purchasing raw materials. Higher brands car demand higher prices of the car because they are not local it is an imported car that offers higher features, technology, and safety as compared to local ones. Secondly, the price varies with the model and availability of parts, the customer always wants the latest model car because new the car has many stock of parts which creates competition among customers for buying that car which enhances the price of the car. The competition in the Pakistani auto market has increased because various auto companies are introducing many cars which tends to increase the prices of cars. It is important to note that this situation will be solved when the economic condition of the country is stable. "

Take a vehicle history report from the previous owner of the car which will help you in providing the past of the car include accident, mechanical issues, and will indicate that the car is used or obsessed. To identify the hidden problem of cars that are now visible to the human eye, check the car with a trusted mechanic who has the technology to identify the problem. Always take a test drive of the car while driving the car pay focus on brake acceleration how it responds and any unusual vibrations from engine production then immediately check with the mechanic. Don’t be afraid of negotiating the prices of cars with the seller. Research the market value of similar cars in your area and if the price of the car is not aligned with the condition of the car then you can stop the deal. and research for other cars. Avoid rushing in to purchase the car take your time to research on car inspected properly by trusted mechanics and then you can buy it.

This exploration delves into the multifaceted dimensions of this critical skill, unravelling its intricacies through insightful perspectives, actionable strategies, and illustrative instances, all with the intent to enlighten and empower individuals on their quest to master this invaluable proficiency. Effective communication, far beyond the mere conveyance of words, emerges as an art form rooted in self-awareness, active listening, and the adept adaptation of one’s communication style. Establishing a robust foundation requires an introspective understanding of personal strengths and weaknesses, coupled with a keen mindfulness of emotional states and biases. In the contemporary cacophony, genuine listening has metamorphosed into a scarce and prized skill. Active listening transcends the auditory domain, embracing non-verbal cues, inquisitive questioning, and an authentic engagement that fosters an atmosphere of mutual respect and comprehension. A recognition of diverse communication styles, shaped by cultural, societal, and individual dynamics, emerges as paramount. The skilled communicator navigates this diversity adeptly, tailoring their approach to suit the context — be it within a team, in a managerial role, or in informal interactions. Personal Discourse: Building Intimacy through CommunicationIn the realm of personal relationships, the efficacy of communication becomes the cornerstone of intimacy and connection. From familial bonds to romantic entanglements, the ability to express oneself authentically, utilize “I” statements to convey emotions, and actively engage with the perspectives of others transforms conflict resolution into a constructive process.

Remember I shared that I went on a group interview for Selfridge feeling unconfident in a group of beautiful women? I knew that appearance really mattered, it might not the number one, but it might cause my insecurity. Especially, western people generally have pronounced facial features. Even though I had put on mascara, I still felt I might be invisible in the group, they are like 3D, but I felt like I was 2D as an Asian. Hahaha Therefore, with the limited money, feeling I was burning my money, I decided to get myself eyelash extensions!! So, I won’t have this kind of insecure feeling bothering me. For men, a suit is the best. For women, makeup and eyelash extensions are lifesavers! Agree? That day I just wore a white shirt and a black pencil skirt to the store. But when I arrived, I realized this look was not for the retailer, I looked like I was there to work in the office. “Okay, it’s fine, it’s fine. They might see me taking this opportunity seriously. Clothing doesn’t matter that much” I was trying to calm myself in my mind. When I arrived at the store, I just realized there was another girl who would have this interview with me.

Debugging is an important part of building products, and it’s just as important to use that iterative lens on your own job-seeking efforts. Many of the people I talk to are not tracking their job applications, have not considered the point where they commonly fall off the rails, and are struggling to figure out how to improve. If you’re going to get a job, especially in a tough economy, you’ve got to apply design thinking to your employment search. How might we turn the distressing process of finding a job into something we can learn from? Let’s start with one of my favorite design artifacts: a journey map! Design interviewing is usually broken up into four types of activities: If you start to track your process according to these stages, you’ll recognize patterns. This is similar to how teams begin to notice patterns when they track and analyze usage data for their products. You can build a job search dataset with a Kanban board in a product like Notion, Figma, Trello, or Asana. There are many templates out there already, but here’s mine if you’d like to use the exact one I did to complete my two most recent job searches.

They have very different memories from that day. Once upon a time, in the little village of Smallville, there were two really good friends. They knew each other very well, in fact, they were so familiar with each other’s company since they spent so much time together. They were so close, that it was hard to tell them apart, their friendship was really thick. Sure perhaps, it was weird that they happened to be a guy and a girl, but they had been platonic buddies for more than a while now, and it was something that everyone had gotten used to, and the surety of this reality was starting to dawn on everyone. However, there was only one person who could take credit for the friendship being awesome in the duo, which was the girl. In this friendship that seemed to withstand the test of time, at least for now, it seemed pertinent that she was the one with verve and the only one who knew what ‘real friendship’ was about. Yes, and so something finally was going to happen between the two of them; Something that would lead them to either ‘question’ the status quo, or choose to cement their existing strong bond of friendship. Usually, most people who ever walked the earth, or had any kind of bond, or friendship ever, have had to face big decisions like this in their lives, and if they chose well, the wisdom of the bond endured as well. As corny as that sounds, it does happen in real life! And many of us would rather avoid those sorts of moments because the reality of them is too ‘phenomenal’ to understand at that moment. The littlest things are often the most important; And usually turn out to be major events that can even have life-altering proportions. ‘Deep conversations’, sometimes could help to offset things, because of their very deep nature. Especially, when they were by their very nature, just that ‘deep’. Conversations do that people. They do often tend to have that sort of magic about them. So, one day, the two friends, Jill and James happened to be sitting down side-by-side whilst talking about everything they loved. This is something they were accustomed to, and they usually did. A habit for them both, the two talked for hours, getting into deep reflective conversations that made the other think. Or blink. Or change the other. Over Coffee. And all this happened at their favorite haunt, the old Cafe, which happened to be opposite Smallville High. Jill casually happened to remark “Hey, James. We have known each other. a really long while now… December is almost here, do you have a favorite Christmas memory? Being a time to celebrate, many think of it as a time of spiritual renewal. So, do you remember anything significant that we can be innovative about, and use to make this one even better?” James looked her in the eye, and couldn’t help but stifle a laugh. He replied with a smile, “Christmas of 2005 was indeed the most memorable for me at least. It was in a word, different which is why I remember it like it happened yesterday.” “It was the one time when, even though I was still very young, and still in junior high, I remember clearly that there was a lot about me that people didn’t get. A total bookworm, and a guy! At the same time, I had an ardent desire to play basketball for the school team.” “Those days were indeed different, but teaching, very teaching. I hated studying, like many other kids back in the day. There happened to be this one person that I really adored. Who did keep me company as well? A teacher that I simply loved and found relatable. She helped me with schoolwork and encouraged me to join the basketball team, which I later ended up doing.” Upon hearing his truthful admission Jill was filled with a sense of ‘awe, wonder, and self-fulfilment’. She found his story ‘relatable’, and she felt that there might be something that he could learn from her as well to enrich his very personal experience. “To me, Christmas of 2010 was the most noteworthy. To tell the truth, I spent much of it at home, with family and friends. I didn’t hate being social, but I was a Bookworm, like you, being an introvert, is something people usually never get.” “There was this one day when, I happened to meet someone from the other class, without anyone ever knowing. We sat down together in the empty classroom and shared a cupcake together, and that was a really amazing experience. I must admit, because it felt new even though we were both so young! His eyes were blue, and they told a story. The cake had blue frosting. And that’s all I can remember about that beautiful day.” After they had done talking they seemed to look at each other for more than a few seconds and then looked away. The topic was indeed random, but it led to another level of self-discovery for both friends, who seemed to get to know each other better and better as time passed by. Like fine new wine. The truth it brought home, brought a new light to their relationship as well. Suddenly it seemed as if the two friends, had added another dimension of richness to the quality of their friendship, just by having this very conversation. Which seemed in a weird way, like something enviable, precious, and ethereal. “So you were an introvert back in high school too! “ they both said in one voice, in unison. Yet it was strange how it sounded almost melodic! And they looked each other in the eye like when they first started talking. They both were somehow relieved. It was like such a lot of unkempt baggage had been released. It was like their yolk was suddenly easier to bear. It no longer seemed weird that they were playing the staring game in public. Without blinking. Like most introverts. Platonic friends. Who hung out. and overdosed on the good things in life. It was like these two friends were going to have lots more to talk about over coffee, at the quaint little cafe, near Smallville High. Soon it was Christmas, a few months after this particular meeting at their favorite old Cafe. The two friends were surprised by each other, and by now felt more at home with each other safe in the knowledge that they were both introverts. They met as usual that Christmas, but this time it was better than any of their previous meetings! A warm Christmas with hot chocolate and marshmallows. A Christmas like no other. "

Lately, I have been struggling to find the drive to write. Given the motor failure in my vintage sewing machine, I cut costs by acquiring a hand crank as opposed to a new one. Why add a hand crank instead of replacing the motor? I consistently speed up quickly on the foot pedal, and it can be intimidating. I am fond of the capacity to regulate the speed for increased accuracy in my tasks. It operates with no electricity or a motor. Manipulating the fabric with one hand and turning it at the same time will be time-consuming. I am fond of the decision to transition to a hand crank. I highly recommended hand crank sewing machines for a peaceful environment, devoid of the noise produced by motorized models. Although they are portable, I would refrain from carrying them because of their significant weight. Currently, I am using a desk light in place of the original light that accompanied the vintage sewing machine. I appreciate the convenience of not having to handle cords and wires. Using hand cranks provides a relaxing experience and serves as an excellent exercise for balance. It offers substantial financial benefits as an alternative to buying replacements for the motor and lights. Swapping a motor to a hand crank is a straightforward process. I had a wish to start it off with a non-electric choice rather than an electric sewing machine. Conclusion My work on the gathered skirt is still ongoing. I am currently facing challenges in gathering fabric. I am determined to continue attempting until I achieve success.

In this series, we are talking to People experts about how they’re utilizing new technologies to make their jobs easier and provide greater strategic value. As a part of this series, we had the pleasure of interviewing Helen Merianos. Helen Merianos joined Sanofi Research & Development in 2021. In her role as Head of R&D Portfolio Strategy, Merianos drives decision-making through objective, externally focused data driven insights and scenario planning. Merianos earned her PhD and MS in biophysical chemistry from Yale University and her BS in chemistry from the University of Virginia. She started her career and spent three years at McKinsey & Co. She has 15 years of experience in the pharma industry, in a variety of commercial and portfolio strategy positions as well as global project head for rare disease and infectious disease. Thank you so much for your time! I know that you are a very busy person. Before we drive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started? I am a scientist by training. My PhD was in structural biology. After finishing my education, I went into management consulting at McKinsey and Company where I spent 3 years leveraging my scientific and analytical strengths to solve business problems. Then, I joined GSK in R&D where I supported investment decisions on medicines at all stages of discovery and development from a commercial perspective. I also held a couple of project leadership roles for medicines in late-development where I was responsible for a large cross-functional team, leading development, regulatory and commercial strategy for the products. In addition, I spent several years leading portfolio management at GSK where I led a business transformation around investment governance. I joined Sanofi a little over 2 years ago and lead the R&D Strategy team guiding portfolio strategy for Sanofi R&D. We are at a critical juncture in the company’s transformation to become a more innovative, science-led and AI enabled pharma company. It is very exciting to be in this role at Sanofi at this moment in time. It has been said that our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that? When I first came to GSK from management consulting, I struggled with my communication style not really fitting into a corporate environment. At the time, I did not know this was the issue. I simply knew I was not making the connections or relationships I needed to be successful in a large pharma company. I went to my boss and explained that I knew how to do the work, but I was struggling on how to get it done in this environment. He was kind enough to take the time to review some of the materials I was using in meetings with colleagues and very quickly explained that it was too analytical, too detailed. Unlike consulting, you don’t have to put all your thoughts/proof points on the page because if anyone has a question later, they will just stop by your office and ask. Once I started communicating with conclusions/high-level analysis and only shared the data if asked, I fit in. I wish I would have asked for help sooner because it was a simple fix. None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful for who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story? I am grateful to so many individuals who helped me along the way. At each inflection point in my career there was always a special individual who helped me make the strategic choices that were right for me. Overall, the most critical aspect of who I am and how I got here comes down to my love of science, my love of data. I got this obsession from my dad who is also a scientist. He incorporated science into everyday life growing up. When he wanted to rush me out of the house for my sports, he would say, ‘Fast like an electron. Not slow like a neutron!’ I was the only kindergartner who knew what an electron was. Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? ‘There is a voice that doesn’t use words. Listen.’ — Rumi This quote speaks to me because for many years earlier in my career, I did not have the loudest voice. I had to learn how and when to use my voice while being true to my authentic self. A prior boss helped me with this challenge, by asking me for my view in meetings. It gave me the space I needed to practice speaking up. I bet if you ask anyone at Sanofi, they will say I no longer have this challenge! This quote also speaks to one of my most sacred values, being data driven and inclusive. It is critical to create the space for different points of view, styles, backgrounds, etc. to ‘speak’ their minds. It is critical in a function like mine where we are guiding massive investment decisions. To get the best decisions, you need a diverse team with diverse perspectives. Including an AI perspective in the room when making decisions, will make us smarter. We need to be open to this transformation in all aspects of our business. Thinking back on your own career, what would you tell your younger self? Be yourself. Fitting in is overrated and exhausting. You won’t always be the youngest or the only female in the room. Let’s now move to the central part of our interview. How have recent technological advancements such as AI made your job easier? AI is transforming portfolio management by leveraging large publicly available datasets to predict many of the inputs used to determine business cases of the investments we make in our potential medicines. AI also provides recommendations for us to investigate to keep us on track with our goals for our innovative pipeline. This data is now able to be integrated and accessible in a transparent way so we can all be smarter about the investments we make in medicines. I have personally benefited with more time to think and strategize based on the data than spending most of the time obtaining the data, cleaning, and integrating it. For me, this means faster and smarter decisions that leverage all the available data both inside and outside the company. We hope the end result will be a bigger impact on the patients we serve. In which processes do you utilize automation the most? We use automation in general business processes like approvals for work with our business partners, expenses, managing complaints, etc. We are also using it to integrate data across business units. The integration of the data is mostly for training the AI we use across the company to make better informed decisions say around risk of a stock out or other important business processes that could directly and significantly impact the patients we serve. What should people bear in mind when automating processes? You still need a subject matter expert to review the deliverables and make sure they make sense. Rarely would an automation result in a significant decision without human intervention. We are using automation to create space for us to think and get smarter with data, including AI. It almost always ends with a cross-functional discussion leading to the decision, but everyone is looking at a single source of truth of the underlying data and what the AI is saying. You can spend the discussion time on risks and opportunities and taking the decision with less or no time debating the data. What are your “Top Five Tips For Harnessing AI Technology to Propel People Operations”? 1 . When you start, the data is probably not 100% correct. Just publish the data anyway. Make it visible. Within a short period, you’ll have better quality data than you have ever had. It is OK not to understand all the details of the AI engine- knowing what data are used to train the algorithm and what data are not, is good enough in the beginning. 2 . The insights from AI take time to build but keep pushing use case by use case. In a surprisingly short period, <6 months, you can transform how you use AI and the insights generated. 3 . Fix your business processes first or in parallel. AI will move more quickly, and you’ll miss the chance for a major business or cultural transformation if you don’t start on those aspects as quickly as possible- ideally first. 4 . Get a team of your best change management experts to support the cultural revolution that AI will drive. Do this early in the process even at the time of your first minimally viable product or MVP. 5 . Start with the business or cultural change you want to drive first then determine how you might leverage AI to deliver the transformation more quickly. This approach will help ensure utility in all the use cases you build enabling quick wins and early proof points which are needed to drive change. What are your favorite “I couldn’t live without these” tools? I cannot live without plai, the Sanofi wide snackable AI app which has all the relevant R&D data I need to do my job with visibility across the business units. I cannot live without my competitive intelligence alerts as it is how I stay updated on the industry. How do you see technology impacting the HR space in the future? I think we will see utility of AI in recruitment process in terms of filtering and screening and ideally helping to ensure a diverse candidate pool for roles. I also think we may be able to leverage AI to increase engagement of employees by addressing problem areas surgically and quickly through Ai-enabled alerts. It could guide managers to address the root cause of diminishing engagement of their teams prior to seeing attrition. We are very blessed to have some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world whom you would love to have a private lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this. Adam Grant. His book “Think Again” provides many examples of where the intersection of data and courage results in the extraordinary. It is critical to challenge our thinking, to listen to all perspectives, including AI. It is powerful to imagine all you know as truth to be wrong and re-think problems and create new options to arrive at the best decisions. Drug development is risky business. We will be wrong a lot of the time, but the more we practice quality decision making, the better we will do for our patients. How can our readers further follow your work?

Abhijit Dubey is Global Chief Executive Officer for NTT Ltd., and member of board of directors for NTT Ltd. and NTT DATA Inc. NTT Ltd. is one of the leading IT infrastructure and service providers in the world operating in 57 countries. Abhijit joined NTT in February 2021 from McKinsey and Company, where he most recently served as a Senior Partner and core leader of the Global Tech, Media & Telecom (TMT) Practice. Prior to McKinsey, Abhijit worked at Schlumberger as a Senior Field Engineer in the Oilfield Services business, based in North Africa. He holds an M.S. in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University and a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering undergraduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai. Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path? Before I joined NTT, I spent more than 20 years advising technology companies at McKinsey & Company, most recently as Senior Partner. NTT was one of the clients that I worked very closely with on their global expansion, outside of Japan. Over the decade I worked with them, their global business expanded from $1 billion in revenue to about $19 billion. It was a privilege when NTT asked me to lead the global business through the next phase of its global expansion — namely to create a world leading IT services company. Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began leading your company? I assumed the CEO role April 1, 2021, right about when the second deadly wave of COVID-19 hit India. Suddenly, there was a shortage of ventilators in the country, amongst a myriad of other challenges. I am extremely proud of how our company mobilized its forces globally to procure ventilators from Mexico and China and used our global supply chain and logistics capability to move them to different cities in India with the highest need. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that? I cannot remember a funny mistake, but I have made several mistakes through the course of my tenure here. One that comes to mind is underestimating the “impact of the unsaid.” We all know that the organization latches on every word and action of the CEO, but they equally latch on (perhaps even more so) on the unsaid. While you can drive absolute clarity on the “said”, it’s always helpful to think through the impact of the “unsaid” when driving CEO comms internally. None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that? My parents have been instrumental in shaping me and my journey. Despite our humble context, they gave it all to ensure the best education possible, while instilling in me the value system that defines me today — the highest integrity, resilience, humility, respect, kindness, and hard work. Leadership often entails making difficult decisions or hard choices between two apparently good paths. Can you share a story with us about a hard decision or choice you had to make as a leader? A global company with operations in more than 57 countries and providing critical infrastructure for the world, brings more than its fair share of challenges on a somewhat higher frequency than many other companies. One such example was the tough choice we faced when Russia invaded Ukraine. On principle, we quickly decided to shut down all our local operations in Russia and stop serving all Russian clients globally. However, one decision was particularly difficult. We have a global IP backbone business that, along with other players, is the foundation for the internet, including in Russia. We faced the difficult choice to continue partnerships with local Russian ISPs so that ordinary Russian citizens could continue to have access to the Internet or sever all ties with the local ISPs. This was a divisive issue within the company, with many of our colleagues wanting a full and complete severing of anything to do with Russia or Russian companies. Instead of shutting down or restricting access to information via the internet, we made our decision based on the founding principle of an open and unconstrained internet and continued our partnerships with local Russian ISPs. Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. Most of our readers — in fact, most people — think they have a pretty good idea of what a CEO or executive does. But in just a few words can you explain what an executive does that is different from the responsibilities of the other leaders? Well, for starters, the buck stops with the CEO. The CEO is ultimately responsible and accountable for everything the company does and delivers to all stakeholders (shareholders, customers, employees, society, community, and the planet). The CEO is the ultimate role model setting the tone for the company culture, sets strategic direction and allocates resources (talent and investment) and is the ultimate risk and crisis manager for the company. And finally, the company and CEO reputation are inextricably linked. The CEO is a “steward” of a company and one of the overarching objectives of a CEO is to ultimately leave the company in a better place. What are the “myths” that you would like to dispel about being a CEO or executive? Can you explain what you mean? I suspect there are quite a few “myths” out there. A few that come to mind. What is the most striking difference between your actual job and how you thought the job would be? Before I came into the CEO role here, I had the privilege of being a trusted counselor to many CEOs and learned a lot about what the job entails. After coming into the role, the “what” of the role hasn’t really been a surprise albeit the relative emphasis and the “how” does differ and comes down to the management and leadership philosophy of the individual. That said, the most striking difference for me has been how much time, effort, and mindshare I spend on preventing and managing risk in the company. CEO = Chief Risk Officer is an equation I hadn’t fully anticipated until coming into the role. Do you think everyone is cut out to be an executive? In your opinion, which specific traits increase the likelihood that a person will be a successful executive and what type of person should avoid aspiring to be an executive? Can you explain what you mean? I firmly believe in the power of human potential, that all of us are limited only by our aspiration and context. As Nelson Mandela said, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” So yes, I believe anyone can become an executive if they so want and are in the right context. That said, becoming a successful executive requires some specific traits in my mind– growth mindset, thirst for continuous learning, superb people management skills, an ability to inspire and galvanize an organization for change, excellent communication skills and above all, someone who lives and breathes the values they espouse at every moment, even when under extreme stress and pressure. What advice would you give to other business leaders to help create a fantastic work culture? Can you share a story or an example? Leaders play a defining role in shaping company culture. My advice on this is very simple — actions speak louder than words. As a leader, you have to role model the values you promote and make the tough decisions needed. As a leader, I have a very simple “One strike, and you are out” philosophy. Even the slightest digression from the values we stand for is automatically dealt with the severest of consequences. However, in the normal course of business, especially in the tech industry, we want people to “take risks.” We want people that are curious, want to learn, and try new things. Here we do allow mistakes. We follow the “fail fast approach.” But when it comes to matters of integrity, this is where we draw a very strict line. How have you used your success to make the world a better place? At NTT we believe in technology for good to realize a more affluent and harmonious society using information technology. This is aligned to my personal passion for sustainability and what drew me to NTT. In a bid to limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement, we have committed to science-based reduction pathways, and have set ambitious climate targets to achieve Net zero emissions across our operations by 2030, and value chain by 2040. We’re also working across our global data centres to achieve 100% renewable energy. And to support our clients and partners reach their sustainability ambitions, we are growing our portfolio of smart solutions to help them in reducing their carbon emissions. Fantastic. Here is the primary question of our interview. What are your “Five Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Became A CEO” and why? 1 . The tyranny of “CEO says” — I continue to be surprised by how my name is brought up by team members to justify what they want done. In many cases, “Abhijit said so!” is false or mispresented. Invoking authority to influence others is the laziest form of influence and I spend time coaching my teams on much more effective forms. 2 . A+ game, every time, all the time — A CEOs every word and action (or lack of it) is scrutinized closely by everyone inside and outside the company. As such, you always have to be on your A+ game in every interaction, whether it be internal or external stakeholders. Imagine a day where you get off a long 12-hour flight, freshen up for an hour, and launch straight into a packed day filled with leadership meetings, employee townhalls, media sessions and customer/partner and government official meetings. This is typical of a country visit I make, for instance, with high stakes in every single one of these interactions. 3 . 99% of time, energy and mindshare is about managing people — Before coming into the role, I felt I had a good grasp of what to expect, having counseled other CEOs over the years and seeking advice from many successful current and former CEOs. I did believe that I would spend a meaningful amount of time on company vision, strategy and resource allocation decisions. While I do spend time on that, it is only 1% of the job. The rest is spent on managing people — inspiring, galvanizing, setting and managing expectations, coaching, orchestrating team dynamics etc. and the list goes on. Running a business is ultimately all about people. 4 . The “last mile execution” challenge — Ever so often, as an executive and senior leadership team, we come up with brilliant ideas, strategies and initiatives. However, I continue to be surprised how hard it is to cascade intent into execution on the field where it matters, despite a continuous rhythm of coordinated communication and reinforcing incentives. 5 . Loneliest job in the world — Again, this is what many CEOs I sought advice from had warned me about. That said, there is no way to really understand how lonely the job is without experiencing and living it. A sounding board is in most cases either inaccessible or not in a position to be effective (e.g., your friends and family.) You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good for the greatest number of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. Having grown up in India, we were raised to treat food with utmost respect and never waste it. Simply because there was so much scarcity around us. If you look at a global scale, roughly one-third of food produced that is intended for human consumption every year is wasted or lost (around 1.3 billion tons and valued at $1 trillion.) This is enough to feed 3 billion people. Besides this, food waste also has a significant impact on the environment and society. If I could inspire a movement, it would be around reducing food waste and be called: “Buy smart, eat all, no wastage befall!” Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? “Trust is the most important currency.” It is hard to build and yet so easy to lose, both in personal and professional contexts. This is what I was taught growing up and have come to appreciate deeply over the years. My entire professional career has been in services (oilfield services, management consulting and now in IT Services) which has the customer at the center of everything we do. Building durable and deep trust is the foundation of working together. We are very blessed that some very prominent names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them. Undoubtedly, Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team. Steve is an incredible athlete and now coach, who deserves most of the credit for building one of the most successful modern-day sports franchises and teams in the world, while at the same time being an incredibly humble and good human being. The CEO job is at once that of a versatile, durable and winning athlete AND a great coach who can bring out the best in others. I would love to learn Steve’s belief system and “micro habits” that have made him who he is. Thank you for these fantastic insights. We greatly appreciate the time you spent on this.

Actor Ben Mehl stars as ‘Dante’ alongside Penn Badgley in Netflix’s hit series “You.” The highly-anticipated third season is being released on Netflix on Friday, October 15th. Developed by Sera Gamble and Greg Berlanti, You is based on Caroline Kepnes’ bestselling books You and Hidden Bodies. Dante is a librarian who retains his wit and equanimity no matter what the day brings. A veteran whose eyesight was damaged, Dante is a dedicated family man with a husband and two stepchildren who longs to expand his family, and delights in helping his friends with their children. Born and raised in Toronto, Mehl graduated from the University of Toronto where he double majored in Astrophysics and Drama. He was accepted to both NYU’s Graduate Acting Program and Julliard but received his MFA from NYU. Mehl has performed largely in theater but has also appeared on television such as “The Good Wife.” In addition to acting, Mehl also teaches acting, voice and movement for actors in NYC. He has taught Movement and Shakespeare’s Clowns at the NYU Graduate Acting Program in addition to Voice and Movement, Physical Characterization and Combat at the New York Film Academy. Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up? Thank you so much for interviewing me! I grew up in Toronto in a very loving and supportive family. My parents immigrated from South Africa with my two older brothers when they were very young, and then a few years later, I came as a surprise. I always loved to imitate sounds and hear rhythms in the pitter patter of dogs’ footsteps, or the rain drops on the roof. My mom always told me there was no such word as “can’t” and that I could do anything I set my mind to. I watched my brothers when they did school shows, and I wanted to do that too. My 4th grade teacher at Lillian Public School, Mr. Craigie, heard me singing the national anthem at school, and recommended that I audition for Claude Watson School for the Arts, a public school that required an audition to be admitted. There was only one spot to join in the fifth grade, and I got it. There, I got to explore drama, music, dance and visual art for half the day, and did all my academics in the other half. I loved my time there and continued in the Claude Watson program as a drama major at Earl Haig Secondary School. I did the school shows, I joined the swim team, I joined four different choirs. I enjoyed science too and was particularly passionate about space. When it came time for college, I wasn’t ready to give up on acting, but also wanted to continue studying science and truly wanted to be an astronaut one day. So I went to the University of Toronto where I could, and did double major in Astrophysics and Drama! Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path? I remember doing a scene in Paul Comeau’s 6th grade drama class, playing Oswald from King Lear. I think this was the first time I felt that while playing this other character, I felt like I was more fully myself. It was a feeling that never left me and would come back every time I got to play another role. I felt like acting allowed me to use myself in the fullest way I knew how. And throughout the crossroads of my life, I have never been willing to let it go. When deciding what to study in college, to rethinking my life after vision loss, to my own common and continual struggle to find work as an artist, to the challenges of raising kids as an actor, there is this passion in my heart for it that I can’t betray. Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career? In my last year of U of T, while I was doing Reefer Madness the Musical at Hart House Theatre, I noticed that there was a spot in front of me wherever I looked, almost like a camera flash in my eyes, following me wherever I looked. I was soon diagnosed with a rare genetic form of macular degeneration called Stargardt’s disease, which causes one to lose their central vision. I was told that it was progressive, and that there was no treatment or cure. My vision deteriorated to the point where I could no longer read normal sized text or recognize faces. I didn’t know whether pursuing a career in acting was possible anymore. How would I read my scripts? How would I see the expression in my scene partner’s face? After taking time to mourn the loss of my central vision and accept my new life, I decided I was not going to let this disease define me, and I would learn what it meant to be an actor with this disability and continue to pursue my dream. So I auditioned for acting schools in the US, including Juilliard and NYU’s Graduate Acting Program, got into both, and chose to go to NYU for my MFA. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that? I was doing a clown show I created with two friends called Paplooey! In the dressing room, I clipped my glasses onto my costume while I put on my makeup. During the show, the three of us are dancing and trying to entertain the audience, and for some reason, the audience seemed much more engaged than usual, and they were laughing and making sounds like they were watching something more entertaining than I thought we were. I soon discovered that our feet had been dancing near misses around my glasses on the floor. Only after the audience let out a loud “AWWW”, and feeling something crunch under my foot, did I realize that I forgot to take my glasses off my costume before the show started. Lesson: don’t make a spectacle of your spectacles! What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now? Tell us about your role on “You.” My role on “You” is my first role where I haven’t had to pretend to be able to see more than I actually can. On the other hand, although I, Ben Mehl, am legally blind, I am not totally blind, like Dante is. So it was very important for me to learn how to be accurate in my representation of him. I trained with an orientation and mobility specialist to learn the proper techniques for using a white cane. I spent a lot of time practicing, first with a blindfold on, to understand how it feels in my body, and then without the blindfold, but just looking into my own blind spot. I normally strain to focus on what I can see in my peripheral vision, but playing Dante, for once I could just let my focus rest in the void in the center of my vision. It was an incredible kind of liberation for me to let go and simply let myself not see. At times I felt like I was preparing for what my future may hold for me. I also spent hours observing and taking notes outside a building for blind residents in New York. I watched how people with experience use their canes. I gained a deep appreciation for the skill it takes to navigate the world without sight, and for the confidence and proficiency I witnessed in people who have learned this skill. I brought all of that into my role. Something very cool about my role in the show is that Dante’s blindness is kind of inconsequential. Sera Gamble was inspired by her blind godfather, and made Dante blind simply because some of us are blind and deserve to be represented. I also love and commend the decision to cast someone who really was blind or low vision. I did struggle with whether it was okay for me to be portraying someone who was totally blind. I recognize my privilege within this community in terms of how much sight I do have. This is why it was especially important to me to do my research and do my best to portray this character accurately. Dante is a confident, independent, but fallible human being who has found extraordinary ways to adapt and continue to be a librarian even after losing his sight. You have been blessed with success in a career path that can be challenging. Do you have any words of advice for others who may want to embark on this career path, but seem daunted by the prospect of failure? Be patient, be grateful and be a good human being. Treat people with respect and dignity and make connections with everyone you can — not only people you think can advance your career. I got this role because an old friend of my wife’s recognized the name of my eye condition and connected me with a masseuse friend of his in San Francisco who has the same disease. Years later I did a show at Berkeley Rep and got to hang out with him and make a new friend. Years later still, he connected me with another visually impaired friend of his, Marilee Talkington. Marilee is an actor and advocate for the inclusion of blind and low vision actors in the entertainment industry. She has dedicated many hours and a lot of heart into helping to open doors for actors with disabilities. Without the work of many disabled artist activists like her, I may never have had the opportunity to audition for this role. I also have to say, I didn’t know if this moment would ever come for me. But if it hadn’t come, it wouldn’t have meant that I was any less deserving of it, or worthy of it. I never stop learning and challenging myself to grow as an artist. All I can hope for is to be ready when these opportunities arrive. I can’t control if or when that happens, I only have control of my work and my commitment. Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”? Follow your joy. Let that be your barometer in your work. Your joy is what brought you to this. When I struggled with not having enough acting work to survive, I searched for something I could do that would keep me connected to that joy, and I found teaching. Through teaching I found a way to stay engaged in the thing I love to do even if I’m not in front of the camera or on the stage. Also, don’t base your self-worth on your success in the industry. You have control over the work you put into your auditions, but not the results. Value yourself for your work and all the other things you do in your life, like the ways you care for yourself, others and the world. None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that? There are so many people who have helped me on my path but one does stand out in the most personal way for me. My mom passed away almost four years ago, two months after my twins were born. She has been my inspiration and guiding light throughout my life. She saw the struggles in her life as challenges to face. She inspired me to face the challenge of Stargardt’s and to stay on my path. She was always there for me to cheer me on. With her loss, I feel myself reaching out in new directions for help as much as I can. Asking for help can be hard, but especially in this career, you can’t do it alone. Don’t deprive someone of the opportunity to help you. Also, appreciate the many people it took to get you where you are today. How can our readers follow you online? I have just started using Instagram! @benmehl This was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success! Thank you so much for taking the time to interview me. It was an honor. "

Efficient and cost-effective logistics are crucial to remaining competitive in this rapidly changing landscape. In this interview series, we are talking to e-commerce managers, supply chain professionals, logistics experts, and anyone with hands-on experience in the field of e-commerce logistics. As a part of this series, we had the pleasure of interviewing Pat O’Brien. Pat is the Managing Director of Fulfillment and Logistics for Harte Hanks. Pat’s fulfillment team puts clients’ brands into customers’ hands, including traditional e-commerce, print-on-demand literature, sales enablement materials, promotional items, product and product samples, and specialty kits. The logistics division helps retailers compete with the freight industry’s largest players on cost and speed. Moving full loads, partial loads, and time-sensitive materials to the tune of more than 1.3 billion pounds of freight per year, Harte Hanks is the master of the middle mile and serves as a true supply chain partner for companies like Office Depot and American Eagle. Pat’s team of 200+ operations and client service professionals operate from multiple production centers across the U.S. and Europe, including a new 400,000-square-foot, FDA-certified facility strategically located in Kansas City and a 300,000-square-foot Boston facility serving the consumer goods, pharmaceutical and healthcare and financial services industries. Before joining Harte Hanks, Pat managed logistics for Wayfair, was a management consultant for Bain & Company, and was a U.S. Navy officer and pilot for a decade. He holds an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is based in Massachusetts. Thank you so much for your time! I know that you’re super busy. Before diving in, our readers would like to get to know you. Can you tell us a bit about your backstory and how you grew up? I grew up outside Boston, the youngest of six kids. My dad and one of my brothers both served in the military. My sisters work in education. Our parents were extremely service-oriented, both in our church and the local community. From a young age, I knew I wanted to serve in some capacity and was lucky enough to end up as a Navy Pilot after graduating college. I flew for the Navy on active duty for 9+ years before deciding to pursue a business career, but luckily, I still get to fly as a part of the Navy Reserves. What led you to this specific career path? My career in operations and logistics evolved naturally. I always loved the operational side of my time in the military, and I gravitated towards ops-heavy courses when I completed my MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I worked as a management consultant for Bain & Co., where I was fortunate to get exposure to many different business practices and industries (private equity, M&A, and post-merger integrations). But what I enjoyed the most were the deep supply chain transformations that I worked on for Fortune 500 retailers and CPG companies; for example, redesigning a supply chain to better compete with Amazon or reimagining a national manufacturing footprint to help a major CPG brand better compete on price and service. During those engagements, I realized I enjoyed being immersed in the day-to-day operations of running and scaling an ops-focused business unit more than serving as a strategic advisor. Can you share the most exciting story that has happened to you since you began at your company? I joined Harte Hanks in 2020, and the past three years have been full of exciting projects, most notably the move into our new 400,000-square-foot Fulfillment Center in Kansas City, Kan. We were at the tail end of closing three other subscale facilities and our team managed the move flawlessly over a period of three months without a single lapse in service to our clients. At the same time, they were onboarding a new operations leader for the site, and I joined the team about a month into the move. It was a great experience to jump into my first days on the job, and it showed me how real the Harte Hanks motto is: “Harte Hanks — We Make it Happen.” What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now? How do you think that might help people? The most exciting projects we’re currently working on are our continued investments in technology. A few months after I joined the company, we brought in a new CTO, Elliott Peterson, who shared my vision of a constantly evolving operational tech roadmap to keep Harte Hanks Fulfillment and Logistics on the leading edge. Together, we built a roadmap that takes the best of what we’ve always offered and unlocks what we’ll need to be competitive in the future. Whether it’s investing in our order management and warehouse management systems or continuing to add capabilities to our proprietary freight rate shopping tool, I’m grateful to work with a leadership team that believes in investing in our tech stack to ensure we stay at the forefront of the operations and logistics industries. You’re a successful business leader. What are three traits about yourself that you feel helped fuel your success? Can you share a story or example for each? Excellent, thanks so much for sharing that. I want to shift gears and talk about e-commerce. What was the original vision for your e-commerce business? What pain point(s) were you trying to solve for your customers? Harte Hanks has been a player in e-commerce for many years already, and my vision was to take our business to the next level. I think our differentiator is our ability to provide multiple streams of fulfillment that naturally augment a successful e-commerce offering. Not only can we manage e-commerce for our clients, but we also handle all forms of direct-to-customer and business-to-business fulfillment. Harte Hanks excels at product sampling, influencer “gift boxes,” complex kitting projects, point of sale/purchase displays for retail, and custom digital printing. Our strategy is to be a one-stop fulfillment provider. One of the other industry pain points we’re addressing is the all-in cost for servicing e-commerce fulfillment. The e-commerce space has grown aggressively and will continue to evolve. However, the expense of fulfillment and the carrying cost of having inventory spread across the country to enable next-day and same-day speed to customers is a constant struggle for companies. Our optimized footprint, plant automation, and low-cost “Value Added Services” allow us to match best-in-class offerings with a lower cost to serve than the biggest players in the industry. What are some of the biggest challenges you currently face regarding e-commerce logistics costs? We are always trying to find the right balance of cost, quality, and speed to customers on behalf of the brands and retailers we support. Amazon has done an amazing job over the past 20 years training customers to expect faster speed. However, there is a cost to achieving that speed, both in fulfillment and inventory carrying costs. Our goal is to help our clients achieve compelling speed, balanced with inventory and shipment visibility while helping them minimize the risks of carrying too much inventory. What role do technology and automation play in reducing e-commerce logistics costs, and what specific tools or solutions have you found most effective in achieving this? Technology and automation are at the forefront of driving down costs and providing better visibility for our clients and their customers. From the front-end ordering process, real-time multi-node inventory visibility paired with outbound shipping optimization is the best way to achieve the lowest cost to fulfill an order. We want the right item to be fulfilled from the right Fulfillment Center that optimizes outbound shipping costs and delivery speed. And we want to partner with clients on how they prioritize the cost/speed balance because it may vary depending on whether a SKU is in high demand or a slower-moving staple. Within our facilities, tech and automation can drive down costs. Real-time inventory visibility allows for fewer “touches” and inventory movement around the facility and unlocks optimized picking patterns for our team. Bringing thoughtful automation to fulfillment activities allows us to do more with less and keep our team members working on the most value-added parts of our overall offering, such as complex SKU kitting. How do you ensure that your logistics providers deliver the highest quality of service at the lowest possible cost, and what metrics do you use to measure their performance? What are some of the key factors that influence your decisions when selecting logistics providers, and what advice would you give to other e-commerce professionals looking to make similar choices? Of course, price is important when selecting a partner. But quality, visibility, client service, outbound performance, and the satisfaction of the end users/customers are also important criteria and determine whether a partnership will stand the test of time. On the logistics side, you can’t underestimate the importance of long-term relationships. We’re a 100-year-old company, and we’ve been providing fulfillment and logistics for over five decades. We have great relationships with carriers and major parcel companies and have developed effective and transparent processes. Can you please share five innovative or unconventional strategies that you’ve employed to reduce e-commerce logistics costs? 1 . Harte Hanks Footprint Optimization: Before I joined Harte Hanks, it became clear to our COO and Fulfillment Leadership that our Fulfillment Centers were mostly subscale and did not offer optimal efficiencies. When I came to the company, we were in the final stages of closing three locations and investing in our new 400K square foot, temperature-controlled, and FDA-certified showcase facility in Kansas City, Kan. Consolidating the smaller facilities has allowed us to maximize operations in our Kansas City facility, leading to lower costs, continued investment in automation and scaled processes allowing fewer touches of inventory as it rolls through our facility. Those savings are passed along to customers to make their fulfillment investment as financially attractive as possible. 2 . Investment in our Tech Solutions: While Harte Hanks’ proprietary Order Management System (nexTouch) has always been at the forefront of capability and client customization, we are in the process of reinvesting in the system to make it more scalable and to lower the cost of integrations with the ordering systems of our clients. This will lower the total cost of doing business with Harte Hanks while reducing our implementation timelines so customers looking for a new fulfillment partner can depend on tight turnaround times to get their items live and sellable. We are also revamping our warehouse management system, which will afford us increased operational savings across our plants, again lowering the total cost of fulfilling our clients’ goods. 3 . Fulfillment Center Automation: While clients increasingly expect higher levels of automation in pick/pack fulfillment, our team continues to automate across all our full suite of fulfillment services. Traditionally, complex kitting for customers with dynamic needs, custom box creation, and sample fulfillment have been more challenging to automate. For the past two years, our team has invested significant time and effort to bring light automation to every step in the process by adding modular conveyors, automated shrink wrap machines, carton erectors, etc. These improvements have lowered our service costs and increased throughput across e-commerce, kitting, and sampling programs at each site. 4 . Freight Optimization: Our Fulfillment and Logistics business utilizes Allink 360°, our proprietary transportation management software, to enable us and/or our clients to find the best rate, route, schedule, and carrier to move shipments. From full truckloads and LTL to parcel shipments, we ensure that products are moving at the best possible rates with high cost transparency and inventory visibility. Our freight team has also partnered with providers seeking innovative freight solutions for clients looking to maximize their e-commerce reach and speed to customers without necessarily having to forward position their inventory all over the country. 5. Innovative Partnerships: We have an array of innovative partnerships with trusted vendors, tech leaders, and our core customer set that help current and prospective clients tap into those partners to help fill any gaps in their overarching fulfillment solution. From product sourcing, creative kitting/sampling options, GTM campaigns, point-of-sale solutions, and technical breakthroughs, when clients work with Harte Hanks, they are privy to our wider internal Harte Hanks offerings (Marketing Services, Customer Care, Inside Sales support) as well as potential support from our critical “Channel Partners” via simple referrals / consultative services. As a 100-year-old company, we’ve built longstanding relationships that level up our internal offerings while exposing our clients to a wider ecosystem of support. Looking ahead, what are the biggest challenges and opportunities in reducing e-commerce logistics costs, and how do you plan to address them in the coming years? I think sustainable scale is key to lowering costs in the eComm space. We are in the early stages of evaluating sites for our next Fulfillment Center, most likely in the western U.S., to strive for a sustainable scale that supports our customers’ needs. As we continue to scale and improve our operational processes to maximize our current footprint, we are looking to ensure that our clients continue to benefit from increased speed to customers and lower outbound shipping costs without getting over their skis on inventory-carrying costs. You are a person of significant influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-) I talk with my family all the time about the importance of understanding U.S. civics and an increasing need for people to understand what being a good local and national citizen means. I believe the biggest challenge we face today is the divide that U.S. citizens perceive between different parts of the nation or different political parties. I think a dedicated refocus on what makes us unique and similar to each other as Americans and some history lessons on how we’ve successfully bridged those gaps in the past would go a long way toward uniting the country and our government and allow us to focus on the challenges that are facing us all.

When ChatGPT first launched, the internet went crazy and I remember making a list of different ways I was going to make money from it. And then AI Art became a thing and I wanted in as well. I made cliparts, patterns, digital products, you name it. So yes, you can say, I was a Gold miner. But in any gold rush, it’s never the miners that make the most money. Because behind the scenes are the shovel sellers making the real money. Now After messing around with AI for months, I feel silly for not trying out this side hustle sooner. If you know the slightest thing about AI, it’s that AI works on a simple principle. Garbage in, Garbage out. Now, there’s something called an AI prompt. It’s like a command you give these AI tools, and based on these commands, you get an output. This principle makes it really tough for people who want to use these AI tools but end up with just generic output or images. The majority of these people are business owners or creative entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to learn how to make better prompts for these AI tools. But they’ll sure be willing to have someone hand all the prompts they need on a platter of gold. We’ll be standing in the gap between the Gold miners and the Gold with high quality prompts to help them level up their output with AI. And with the rate at which new AI tools are being launched these days, the possibilities are endless. Businesses and creative entrepreneurs are looking for all kinds of AI prompts for tools like And your job is to learn how these tools work and create an entire side hustle where you sell these prompts to them. I’m seriously considering this side hustle and I’ve already compiled some of my best prompts on Leonardo.ai For example, here’s a prompt I created for a clipart I currently sell in one of my creative shops. Other creatives would die for a prompt like this, to help them create design bundles they can sell marketplaces like Etsy, Creative Fabrica and Gumroad. So we’re basically selling them a prompt that either make them more money or saves them time. And that’s is in fact very valuable. Remember how I mentioned something about AI founders constantly releasing new tools? Well, It’s crucial to cut through the noise and choose just one AI tool. You could choose ChatGPT or maybe an AI art generator like Dalle. But, for any tool you choose to create prompts for, it has to be very popular. If you create prompts for a lesser known tool, you’ll basically be limiting your market cap. So to make the most money, stick with the three big dogs: Like I mentioned earlier, I use Leonardo.ai for all my creative needs, and I was thrilled about selling a bundle with all my prompts. So yes, there’s a learning curve. You’ll have to learn how these AI tools work if you want to create prompts that provide consistent high quality outputs. Now that’s not an excuse for you to not try this side hustle because I have the way out. Watch hundreds of videos about the AI tool you’ve picked until you can make prompts buyers would die to get a hold of. Yeah, I know, it sucks. This was supposed to be a free side hustle and it still is, you just have to choose your own pill. To be honest with you guys, I took the first route and learned everything I know about AI from YouTube but it took me months to know what I know now. The truth, folks, I learnt everything I know about AI from YouTube. But It took me months to grasp what I know now. If you’re willing to invest a few dollars, I highly recommend you check out Ken Bluttman. He sells AI Art prompt class specifically for Midjourney. Now Midjourney is the largest AI art generator there is and it’s even better than Leonardo ai. The best part is, they work almost the same. So when you learn Prompting for Midjourney , the best of them all, you can apply the knowledge elsewhere. Remember, you don’t have to buy the class. But if you value your time and want to launch this side hustle a lot faster, then you can check out this prompting class here. Now, this is the part that always gets me very excited. And if you guys know anything about me, you know how much I love marketplaces. Prompt Base is a very new but trendy marketplace that launched during the rise of AI to the spotlight. Just from the name, you know this marketplace is dedicated to selling AI prompts for different AI tools. So the traffic is quite targeted and specific. You can create a free shop and start submitting your AI prompts singly. It’s that simple. No one is talking about prompt Base, so the competition is still very friendly. Etsy is another marketplace and probably the best for selling your AI prompts. They get more than 454 million visitors every month, and these are all potential buyers for your products. Now, If you’ve ever tried selling on Etsy and made no sales, it’s probably one of two things But that won’t be the case for our AI prompts. Because Plus, it’s so obvious that the demand is there. So you can sell AI prompts on Etsy to make passive income. In fact, some people were smart enough to get in on this very early and are already making thousands of dollars. For a clear picture of how much you can make with this side hustle, I found 2 Etsy shops selling their AI prompts. First, we have purrfect city, And at an average price of $3.43 per prompt, this shop has made well over $9,312 passively. I also found a shop called Guide pro And at an average price of $4.99 per prompt pack, this shop has made $9,585 in passive income. My point is, AI isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay. You either adapt or get left behind. And Prompting is one of the best skills you can learn in this day and age. So if you’ve been looking for a way to get a piece of the AI pie, here’s your chance. Start your AI prompt shop today. Remember, Midjourney is just one of the AI tools you could be creating prompts for. The Prompting Class I showed you guys is for Midjourney & Midjourney is not free. It costs $10 per month but I believe it’s worth it. Once you learn how to create these prompts, you can launch your own prompt shop, or even take this side hustle one step further. Use your prompting skills to make money in various other ways. For example, you can So you learn the skill once and you’ll keep making money from your knowledge. So consider this side hustle and start improving your AI prompting skills on YouTube or with Ken Bluttman’s AI art Prompting Class.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

You know, the one who always seem to get way more done than everybody else, but who never seems stressed or frantically trying to finish an assignment. How does he or she get it done? And can you steal those secrets to improve your own productivity? Yes. Yes you can. Studies has shown that most productive employees, pinpoint the working flow that leads to that incredible ability to get things done. And the trick might surprise you. Turns out, what the most productive 20% of employees have in common is their ability to take effective breaks. Specifically, the most productive people work for 55 minutes at a time, then take a break for 15 minutes before getting back to their work. The employees with the highest productivity ratings, in fact, don’t even work eight-hour a day. Turns out, the secret to retaining the highest level of productivity over the span of a workday is working longer — but working smarter with frequent breaks. The reason the most productive 20% of our users are able to get the most done during the comparatively short periods of working time is that their working times are treated as sprints. They make the most of those 55 minutes by working with intense purpose, but then rest up to be ready for the next burst. In other words, they work with purpose. Working with purpose can also be called the 100% dedication theory — the notion that whatever you do, you do it full-on. Therefore, during the 55 minutes of work, you’re dedicated to accomplishing tasks, getting things done, and making progress. Whereas, during the 15 minutes of break, you’re completely removed from the work you’re entirely doing — you’re entirely resting, not peeking at your email every five minutes or just “quickly checking Twitter.” There are a lot of surprising benefits to this rest time. First and foremost to your levels of productivity, working for long periods of time can be detrimental to your level of engagement with a certain task… "

It was a Monday. I woke up in our little place in Berkeley and, for some strange reason, decided to wear a pressed white dress shirt for the day. I never wear a shirt like that because I always wear something comfortable like a t-shirt and jacket, but I saw it in my closet and put it on, and my wife, Livia, said I should wear it. So I did. I walked the thirty minutes it took to get from our house to the downtown Berkeley BART station, swiped my card through the turnstile, sat down on a bench, and waited for the train. It takes twenty-three minutes to get from downtown Berkeley to the Montgomery Street station in San Francisco, and the train travels in a tube strapped to the bottom of the San Francisco Bay. It always made me a bit nervous, which made my questionable white shirt a bit sweaty. I knew the shirt was a mistake. Carrying my Apple PowerBook in my backpack, I walked the thirty minutes it took to get from Montgomery Station to Twitter’s office, then on Bryant Street. By the time I got into the office, approximately two hours after waking up, I was shvitzing a little. As soon as I walked into the office my friend and Twitter’s fearless Product Manager, Jason Goldman told me that Ev was waiting for me in his car downstairs. It wasn’t normal for me to show up at work and be told that Ev was waiting for me to go somewhere else. Something was up. “Why’s he waiting for me? What’s the meeting?” I asked. “Just go.” He said. So I turned around and went back outside the building. Sure enough, Ev was waiting right out front for me. I got into the car. “Where are we going?” “Palo Alto.” I couldn’t remember anything about Palo Alto on my schedule so I started grasping. “Oh! Is today the day we’re supposed to do that Q-and-A for Google?” I said. “I wish I hadn’t worn this shirt. I feel weird in this shirt.” It was just an ordinary white button-down shirt, like a suit shirt, but I was obsessing. Should I have tucked it in? I already felt awkward in the stupid shirt, and now we were going to Google — or somewhere. We started driving toward 101 South. Ev likes to drive fast. And in spite of his general patience with me, he would get annoyed when I babbled. "

At first glance, they may not seem like much. Reading OpenAI’s announcements, it’s easy to get bogged down in the nerdy specificity of some of these new additions. But make no mistake; as technical as they may seem, OpenAI’s new announcements have the potential to change the world just as much as ChatGPT did around this time last year. Here’s the core of what OpenAI announced, and why it matters. One of OpenAI’s most exciting announcements was the availability of the GPT-4 Vision platform through their API. Previously, OpenAI had released the Vision platform only via their ChatGPT interface. Vision is super powerful, but was somewhat limited — in order to use it, you needed to log into ChatGPT and upload your images manually, a few at a time. Adding Vision to OpenAI’s API is a game changer. It means that instead of having to use a manual process, developers can now build vision capabilities directly into their own applications. A screen-reader company, for example, could build the system into their software, allowing visually impaired readers to have a description of any image on the internet instantly created and read aloud as they surf. I tested this new capability myself and it’s pretty remarkable. Media companies like my company, Gado Images, can use the Vision platform to understand the visual contents of our databases of tens of thousands, or even millions, of images. That capability makes it way easier to locate valuable parts of a collection. "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

But the viewpoint is mostly as an interviewee, not as an interviewer. In my 25 years in Big Tech, I’ve conducted over a thousand interviews (eight hundred at Amazon as a Bar Raiser, a couple of hundred at Microsoft, and shy of a hundred at Google). Big Tech has 3 types of interviews for Software Engineers: [1] Coding, [2] Systems Design, [3] Leadership, soft skills, culture, etc. Loops tend to have a blend of these 3. For example an SDE-I might have 3 coding, 1 systems design, 1 leadership, while a Principal Engineer might have 1 coding, 2 systems design, 3 leadership. I personally prefer the more open-ended Leadership interviews, as I feel I learn more about the candidates that way. But Coding interviews are a necessary evil. For coding interviews, I have often asked a variation of the following problem, loosely based on something I had to do in real life. Since I decided to retire the question, I’ll dissect it today. I want to focus on explaining what I looked for in a candidate with this question. The question is not particularly difficult, but it does require a little bit of thinking and knowledge of code complexity and data structures. You can easily get the customers that came on both days, you can easily get the customers that visited at least two unique pages, but getting the intersection of those two efficiently requires a little more work. I’ve probably asked it 500 times, which has allowed me to calibrate it quite well. I have found that a Hire / No Hire decision from this question aligns with the final loop Hire / No Hire decision on a candidate about 95% of the times. I can also upscale it for higher level candidates, which makes it fairly versatile, and there’s many hints I can give to candidates struggling along the way. Great candidates must ask clarifying questions before jumping into coding. I’m hoping to see some intuition from my candidates as I’ve actually expressed the problem in an ambiguous way. Did I mean 2 unique pages per day or overall? This significantly impacts the solution. I mean “2 unique pages overall” because that’s a much more interesting problem. About half the candidates jump straight into coding without clarifying this, and out of those, half assume incorrectly that I meant “2 unique pages per day.” If it’s a more junior candidate, I’ll hint heavily before they start coding. If it’s a more senior candidate, I’ll wait a bit and see if that comes up as they’re thinking more deeply about the algorithm. In real life, engineers deal with ambiguity all the time, and the root of most software problems can be traced back to poorly defined requirements. So I want to get a signal on spotting and dealing with ambiguity. There’s one more clarifying question that 90% of people miss upfront, but that also matters: What about duplicates? Visits to the same page in the same day? What about visits to the same page on different days? For this problem, these are duplicates. Another clarifying question that matters is what scale are we talking about here? Does the data fit in memory? Can I load the contents of one of these files in memory? Can I load the contents of both? The question was inspired by a real-world system that I worked on at Amazon, called Clickstream, that was responsible for tracking user behavior on amazon.com. We processed petabytes of events from millions of concurrent customers on a giant Hadoop cluster of ten thousand hosts, and we had an entire team of engineers maintaining and operating the system. But for the purposes of a 45-minute interview, just imagine the data fits in memory, with a much smaller scope. Lastly, another clarifying question that is important is how much does Performance vs Memory vs Maintainability matter? There’s a naive solution that is O(n²) in running time, but only uses O(1) of memory. There’s a better solution that has running time of O(n) but uses O(n) of memory. And there’s an in-between solution that does some pre-processing in O(n log n) with O(k) of memory, which allows you to run the main algorithm in O(n) with O(1) of memory. Each one has pros and cons. Some of the heuristics you may use for improving performance or memory usage may make the code harder to read and evolve later on. On more senior candidates, I’m hoping to have a spirited chat about these. In theory you could write a pretty simple SQL query, and sure, Big Tech companies have giant data warehouses where you can easily do this sort of thing. But for the scope of a coding interview, you wouldn’t want to. Since this is not a distributed systems problem and the data fits in memory, why introduce the additional complexity and dependencies of a database for something that you can solve with 20 lines of simple code? Starting point: About 80% of the candidates go for the naive solution first. It’s easiest and most natural. It’s some form of “for each element from file 1, loop for all the contents of file 2, looking for elements with the same customer id, and keeping track of the pages they view.” The problem with the naive solution is that its running time is O(n²). I don’t mind getting the naive solution first, but I really want to see my candidate having that aha moment that O(n²) is probably never good in any problem. And I want that aha moment to come pretty quickly and without hints. No great engineer should ever settle for an O(n²) algorithm, unless bound by memory or some other unmovable constraint. After a candidate puts forth the O(n²), I smile politely and I wait. I am really hoping the next words that come out of their mouth are “…but the complexity of this is O(n²) so can I do better?” I’ll probe, “what’s the running time of this solution”? And most of the times, the candidate will have the aha moment after that hint and move on to a better solution. At this point you need to do some thinking about what data structure you’re going to use, and how you’re going to store your data. Poor candidates go for linked lists, or arrays. You don’t know the size of the data upfront, so you can’t use arrays. And linked lists have O(n) search, therefore you’ll end up back to an O(n²) algorithm no matter how hard you try. You can use a Tree, but since search is O(log n), that’ll yield an overall best of O(n log n). Better candidates have the intuition that a Map will provide the O(1) lookup that they need to turn the O(n²) algorithm into an O(n) algorithm. Great candidates will proactively point out the downside is that you’ll use O(n) memory. If you want to be more pedantic about it, you can even point out maps have the hidden cost of running a hashing function over and over again, which can be expensive. Overall, faster running time at the expense of more memory is a good tradeoff to highlight. If you’re using a Map, what is your Key, and what is your Value? I’ve seen all kinds of answers here. Some candidates use PageId as the Key, and CustomerId as the Value, but that is not going to help. Candidates then switch it around to have CustomerId as the Key, and PageId as the Value of the Map. But that’s not particularly great either because it overlooks the fact that you can have many pages per customer, not just one. Some candidates have the intuition that they need a Collection of pages as the Value of the Map, but they’ll go for a List, which saddens my soul because it overlooks the fact that you can have duplicates. This is a good opportunity to probe around data structure knowledge on Lists vs. Sets, as candidates think about handling duplicates. So, Map<CustomerId, Set<PageId>> will do. But will you load the contents of both files into a single Map? Or have two maps, one for each file? Or can you get away with just loading the contents of file 1 into a map, and processing file 2 without storing it? Great candidates realize they can go for option#3 right away on their own. That’s a lot less memory, and a simpler algorithm. Good candidates get there, but need a little hinting. The condition “customers that came on both days” is pretty simple: as you’re reading a customer entry from Day2, if the customer is in the Map from Day1, then you know they came on both days: The condition “customers that visited at least 2 unique pages” tends to be a little harder for candidates to get right, so if they’re stuck I throw a little hint: you have a Set of pages from Day1, and a single page from Day2… how can you determine that this is at least two unique pages? Poor candidates will loop through the elements in the Set to check if the page from Day2 is in there. This turns your O(n) algorithm into O(n²) again. The number of candidates who have done this is surprising. Better candidates will do a .contains() on the Set which is an O(1) operation on a hash set. But there is still a catch with the logic. The intuition to get this right is this: If you are inside that If loop and the customer visited at least two pages in Day1, and they visited any page in Day2, they’re loyal, regardless of which page they visit in Day2. Otherwise, they only visited only one page in Day1, so the question is: is this a different page? If so they’re loyal, else it’s a duplicate so you don’t know and should keep going. You need attention to detail, like using “>” instead of “>=” or missing the “!” in the second clause. I saw these fairly often. I didn’t worry. Great candidates spotted them quickly as they double-checked the algorithm when they were done. Good candidates spotted them after a little bit of hinting. That gave me a good signal on debugging skills. If candidates get to this point and we have some extra time, it’s kind of nice to probe on how to optimize for either speed or memory usage. Bonus points for some discussion about tradeoff between these versus future maintainability. For example, if memory is a constraint, you don’t need to actually keep every single page from Day 1 in the Map, just two, since the problem is “at least two pages” so a Set of size 2 or even an array of size 2 will use less memory than an unbounded Set. Or, if you’ve already determined that a customer is loyal, you don’t need to waste CPU cycles going thru the logic again next time you encounter that customer in Day 2. The vast majority of candidates go for the Map approach, but sometimes I have a candidate go for the other one. Maybe 5% of the time at most. What if you pre-processed the files and sorted them by CustomerId, then by PageId? Pre-processing is a powerful tool in your software engineering arsenal, particularly if you’re going to be performing an operation a bunch of times. You can take the hit of pre-processing with the first one, or do it beforehand, which amortizes the cost over time. Sorting the files can be an O(n log n) operation with constant memory. If the files are sorted, then the problem is easier and it’s just a two-pointer algorithm that you can execute in O(n) with O(1) of memory. You move the pointers for file 1 and file 2 until they’re both on the same CustomerId, which means they came on both days. Since the second sort key is by PageId, you use another two-pointer algorithm to determine that there are at least two unique pages. So it’s a 2-pointer algorithm within a 2-pointer algorithm. It’s kind of a fun problem! I’ll leave the actual implementation as an exercise for the viewer. I hope this little insight into a coding problem from the viewpoint of an interviewer, and the ways in which I’ve seen great, good and poor candidates approach it, has been useful to you. Best of luck in your next interview! "

Your pains as a developer are real — the pressure to deliver cutting-edge products, stay competitive, and keep up with evolving user expectations can be overwhelming. But what if we told you that there’s a compass to navigate this complex terrain? What if there were insights that could not only ease your pains but also spark a wildfire of inspiration? Well, you’re in luck because we’re about to embark on a journey through the future trends of back-end and web development. In this article, we will unveil the key trends that will define the year 2024, providing you with the tools and knowledge to stay ahead of the curve. Whether you’re a seasoned developer striving for excellence or a product owner seeking to drive innovation, this is your roadmap to success. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are no longer buzzwords but powerful tools in the arsenal of developers. In back-end development, they play a pivotal role in automating tasks, analyzing vast datasets, and making data-driven decisions. Here’s how you can use them to your advantage: Serverless architecture is a trend in web development that will continue to expand in 2024. Often referred to as Function as a Service (FaaS), it eliminates the need for developers to manage servers. Instead, you can focus on writing code and deploying functions, enhancing scalability and cost-efficiency. The serverless approach allows programs to operate on cloud-based servers. So you don’t need to be concerned with server availability, capacity, or infrastructure management. AWS, Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and others offer such services. Furthermore, it is very cost-efficient, since the service cost is usually calculated depending on real resource utilization. You can apply this development trend in most businesses for image identification, multimedia processing, chatbots and assistants, notification engines, IoT apps, data collecting, and so on. This emerging technology decentralizes data processing by moving it closer to the source. In web development, you can minimize latency and enhance real-time capabilities. Reduced latency: since edge computing brings computation closer to the data source, it reduces the round-trip time between a user’s request and the response. This significantly lowers latency, making web applications more responsive and improving the user experience. For real-time applications like online gaming, video streaming, and IoT interactions, lower latency is crucial. Improved performance: also, with this 2024 trend, your web applications have faster performance. Content delivery networks (CDNs) are a common implementation of edge computing that caches and serves content from edge servers. The approach decreases the load on the back-end servers and accelerates content delivery. Bandwidth savings: less data is transferred to centralized points or cloud services. So you have significant bandwidth savings, especially in scenarios where large volumes of data are generated. Real-time data processing: edge nodes can process data in real time, making it ideal for applications that require immediate analysis and decision-making. For example, in IoT apps: sensors can process data at the edge to trigger actions or alerts without relying on centralized servers. It is a trendy cybersecurity approach that challenges the traditional perimeter-based security model. In a zero-trust model, organizations do not automatically trust any user or device, whether they are inside or outside the corporate network. Instead, it assumes that threats can come from both internal and external sources, and it verifies and validates every user and device attempting to access resources. Here are the key principles of this software development trend: The Internet of Things is a rapidly growing software development trend. This is an interconnected network of physical devices that collect and exchange data over the Internet. These devices can range from simple sensors and actuators to complex industrial machinery and consumer appliances. Smart homes, robot vacuums, lightning, and conditioning — all of these features are a part of IoT. There are approximately 15.14 billion connected IoT devices. They generate vast amounts of data, including device statuses and user interactions. You can create systems for your web or mobile app to ingest, process, and store this data efficiently. This trend pairs well with cloud computing since the data is typically stored and processed in the cloud. You need to work with platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to build scalable and reliable back-end systems for IoT applications. While not directly related to back-end or web development trends, ergonomic keyboards are gaining attention among developers. They often spend long hours typing and coding, which can lead to discomfort and health issues if not properly managed. Ergonomic keyboards are designed with the user’s comfort and health in mind. With reduced discomfort and a more comfortable typing experience, your productivity increases. You also have reduced downtime due to discomfort-related breaks. Rust Rust is gaining momentum as a robust and secure programming language. Its memory safety features make it ideal for systems in backend development that prioritize performance and security. JavaScript JavaScript has been a trend in software development for quite a long time. It continues to play a crucial role in the industry. While JavaScript was traditionally a front-end language, it has expanded its reach into back-end development as well. Node.js, a runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side, has gained significant popularity. It allows you to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides of a web application, making it a full-stack language. At the same time, JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that simplify web development. For back-end development with Node.js, you can take advantage of frameworks like Express.js and NestJS. JavaScript is often used in serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. Python Python has long been a popular programming language for back-end software development. Python’s clean and easy-to-read syntax makes it an excellent choice for developers, whether they are beginners or experienced programmers. This simplicity accelerates development and reduces the likelihood of errors. There is a rich ecosystem of libraries and packages that simplify web and back-end development. Python works well with another trend of 2024 — cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. For example, you can use libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data-driven web applications in IoT, machine learning, and AI systems. Django Django has been a trend in web development for a while. Its main goal is to make the development process faster and more efficient by providing a robust and flexible foundation. One of Django’s major strengths is its emphasis on rapid development. It follows the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) principle and provides a high-level, clean, and pragmatic design that allows you to build feature-rich web applications with less code and effort. Moreover, the framework includes an admin interface that is automatically generated depending on the data models defined in your application. With the interface, you manage your app’s data easily, making it a valuable tool during development and for site administrators. Node.js It is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment with which you can run JavaScript code on the server side. Node.js has gained significant popularity and has become a development trend in 2024. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications. Also, Node.js allows you to use JavaScript not only for client-side web development but also for server-side programming. This unification of client-side and server-side code simplifies the whole process, as you re-use the same language and libraries on both ends. Svelte Svelte is a game-changer in web development. It compiles components into highly efficient JavaScript, resulting in faster load times and a smoother user experience. Svelte is often compared to React, another popular JavaScript framework. While React focuses on a virtual DOM, this one takes a different approach by compiling components into efficient JavaScript code during build, potentially leading to better performance. Qwick It is an open-source project featuring a modern JavaScript framework. Qwick optimizes web application performance, particularly focusing on speed and efficiency. The framework is becoming a trend for its rapid page load times and efficient rendering approach, even for complex websites. Unlike traditional frameworks that require client-side hydration for interactivity, Qwik eliminates this step, further improving load times. The world of back-end and web development is poised for exciting changes in 2024. From AI and ML integration to serverless architecture and edge computing, you have a lot to look forward to. Check out these trends and technologies now to harness their full potential and remain competitive in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Originally published at https://shakuro.com "

We started our visit at Dream Harvest Farming, the only organic vertical hydroponic farm in Texas. It was really great to see a sustainability minded start up; I was impressed by both their entrepreneurial spirit and their great tasting kale. At Waste Management, I was interested to learn about their innovative technology projects reimagining the future of waste, from methane capture at landfills to turning waste into a coal replacement or jet fuel. Next, at EDP Renewables, I was excited to learn there are positions available to all areas of study as long as they are passionate about renewable energy. My own course of study, Sociology, is a little unconventional for the sustainability field, but I view my skills in sociological research as a strength. We ended the day at the City of Houston’s Green Building Resource Center with a great view of the Houston skyline over the building’s solar panels. Thank you to all our hosts and the career center for facilitating this trip! I am more excited than ever to know the range of possibilities for sustainable work! #SustainabilityHouston "
https://medium.com/@kh39/ghosting-employers-3c5d556cc516?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Breaking up is hard to do… Anyone who has been in the dating game knows that when it isn’t the right fit, it isn’t always easy to let the other person know. The same thing happens when you are looking for your first job out of college. You’ve got high aspirations, a hope to make a difference in the world, a drive to put all you’ve learned in college to good use, and a twinkle in your eye for that first “real” paycheck. It can be a lot like dating. You put yourself out there, get to know a company, and let them get to know you. The stakes are high. You make sure to put your best foot forward. One big similarity between applying for jobs and dating — how you handle moving on when it just isn’t the right match. Organizations, like Relay GSE, are looking for passion, commitment, a social justice orientation, cultural consciousness, and a learner mindset in our future teachers. We are also looking for professionalism, courtesy, and respect — whether Relay and teaching is the right fit for those we recruit or not. Just like you, recruiters and hiring managers are investing time and resources into finding, developing, and selecting great fits for their organization. We put a ton of energy into strong prospective candidates because we know that this decision is important for the candidates we are recruiting — and for the deserving students they will teach. This year, my colleagues and I noticed something during the recruitment season. A trend that has hit the dating world came to our door steps. We’ve heard the stories. Charlize Theron famously did it to Sean Penn. Jake Gyllenhall reportedly did it to Taylor Swift on her birthday. Drake claims Rhianna did it. Aziz Ansari wrote a whole book about it. Ghosting. Look it up in Urban Dictionary and you will find that ghosting is “the act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone the subject is dating, but no longer wishes to date.” It’s like being stood up at the prom. You’re waiting around for your date to show, but nothing happens. No call. No text. No message from a friend. Nothing. Though the veil of technology is there, the impact is still the same. A company or recruiter puts time and energy into a candidate — and the candidate doesn’t respond to an email articulating a next step. Sometimes for college students it can feel just as frustrating — you apply for a job and never hear back — or even get an interview and yet, after the interview, may not hear back. No matter which way ghosting happens in the hiring process, it surely doesn’t feel good. Recruiters are wondering, “What just happened?” Where did that smart, professional, impressive individual go?” Likely you wonder the same. “Things were going so great with this organization — what just happened?” I completely empathize — and yet want to make sure you know that when you don’t think the role or the company is the right fit for you, you just have to tell us. It helps you save your time by not having the stress of consistently avoiding emails from an opportunity you no longer want. Organizations would much rather hear, “I’ve found another position,” or “I have decided I want to do something different,” than candidates assuming we’ll “take the hint” and never getting back to us. Most people don’t enjoy tough conversations, but overcoming that fear and anxiety can build your confidence and your communication skills, which will help you throughout your career. Your reputation is important. Employers are connected and you never know when you’ll run into that recruiter again. You want to put your best self out there, from beginning to end. Additionally, we have had the wonderful fortune of meeting candidates who think a company, organization, or mission isn’t a good fit the year they graduate from college, only to realize it is just what they were looking for a few short months into a job that turns out not to be all they’d hoped. How wonderful it will be if that door is still open for you. Whether in dating or job searching, let’s aim to do better and leave ghosting to Halloween. "
https://medium.com/the-ga-index/why-we-should-all-be-angry-5b66d53bb549?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"General Assembly (GA) is a community committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We aim to provide a welcoming environment for everyone at GA: students, staff, instructors, clients, and anyone who walks through our doors, physical or virtual. No matter what, we strive to uphold our work value to “Keep Getting Better” in our diversity journey. In the United States, where many in our community are located, there is a long history of violence and harassment against People of Color. Now that many people carry cameras with them and have instant access to social media, these acts of violence and harassment are more likely to be swiftly and readily exposed. In recent weeks, we have experienced a shared sense of grief and horror over the untimely deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and the harassment of Christian Cooper. We stand with People of Color and are fully committed to creating physically and emotionally safe spaces for our entire GA community. We do not tolerate racism or racial harassment of any kind — and we never will. In that spirit, we share this reflection by James Page, General Assembly’s Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: As a Black man in America, I’ve been aware since my teen years that others’ fears are closely linked to my skin color. While I found some humor when a White woman would clutch her purse as I walked by, there was also significant frustration. I was a nerdy Catholic school kid who liked to crack a joke. However, my identity as a Black man was perceived as dangerous and threatening in a way that superseded anything else about me. In 2016, I took a trip to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture with my 13-year-old son. I will never forget the Emmett Till exhibit, where an open casket holds a photo of Emmett’s beaten and deformed face. I was frozen. I held my son’s hand, and without any real awareness, tears began to roll down my face. My son asked me what was wrong. I explained that Emmett was a 14-year-old African-American boy who was visiting family in Mississippi in 1955. A White woman accused him of whistling at her, and he was brutally beaten and murdered by two White men. The killers were found not guilty, even though they admitted to killing him one year later. They were confident that the American legal system would protect them. Sixty-two years later, Emmett’s accuser admitted she lied — he never whistled at her. Her false accusation was enough to end that young man’s life with no recourse to his accuser or his murderers. Fair-minded people can agree that taking another human life is wrong, and share the sense of outrage at the senseless, recent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. However, the story of Emmett Till and its connection to the story of Amy Cooper speaks to a much deeper pattern of racism, exploitation, and injustice that is pervasive and prevalent in our society. Why am I angry at the justice system and our police force? Why am I angry at Amy Cooper? Why should we all be angry? Because she shared the same sense of privilege and entitlement as Emmett’s accuser when she called the police on Christian Cooper. She knew that if she called 911 and expressed fear as a White woman threatened by a Black man, she would be believed, and a Black man would be punished, regardless of what actually happened. She weaponized her racial advantage and it could have been lethal to Christian Cooper: just as it was when Carolyn Bryant lied about Emmett Till, when Eleanor Strubing accused Joseph Spell of rape, and when Tom Robinson was accused of raping Mayella Ewell in To Kill a Mockingbird. Black men have been conditioned to fear the police, the U.S. justice system, and White women. It is well known that when the cops, or “the posse” show up, the Black man — a 14-year-old Black boy visiting family, a Black man in a consensual relationship with a White woman, a Black character in one of the greatest novels of all time, or a Black Harvard grad birdwatching in a park — can be arrested, beaten, jailed, abused, and subjected to extreme acts of violence. His Black body can be deemed disposable, be made an example of, and deemed unimportant, a piece of property for the public; another piece of “ strange fruit — blood on the leaves, blood at the root.” While fear is closely linked to my identity, passed on from generation to generation, it is a fear that I must submit to — unbelievable in 2020. I must learn and follow the unspoken rules. I must fear the police, the justice system, bank lenders, the President of the United States, and the White woman clutching her purse — innocuous people or protectors under any other circumstance. As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote, “It is not necessary that you believe that the officer who choked Eric Garner set out that day to destroy a body. All you need to understand is that the officer carries with him the power of the American state and the weight of an American legacy, and they necessitate that of the bodies destroyed every year, some wild and disproportionate number of them will be Black.” The only way to end this ongoing cycle is to educate ourselves, show up for People of Color, and get involved in the political process. This is not a new moment in our nation’s history, but part of the ongoing suffering, injustice, and inhumane treatment of minorities; these acts of aggression, violence, and unequal rights we are experiencing right now create real trauma for communities of color who have to live every day in fear. All of us have a role to play in dismantling institutional racism in this country; all of us must help address — and heal — that trauma. Now is the time to stand together and say, “No. More.” If you are looking for ways to show up as an ally in this time, here are some places to get started — we share a handful of resources and it is by no means exhaustive: At General Assembly, we will never compromise on ensuring that everyone within our community gets treated with dignity and respect. In the spirit of our shared commitment to learning, we urge all of you to engage on these issues with curiosity, humility, empathy, and self-awareness in service of active dialogue, brave allyship, and the human goodness that can be brought out by all of us.

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/managing-remote-teams-advice-from-the-experts-part-3-7419c3c9a0bb?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"We’ve reached the last segment of our three-part blog series on managing remote teams. We hope our experts’ advice has been useful for team leaders who are transitioning to working from home and adjusting to this new normal in the world of work. For our final installment, we sat down with General Assembly’s very own Caitlin Davey, Manager of Learning Experience Design. Caitlin has managed a remote team for 2 years and has deep experience designing remote learning experiences in data for GA’s enterprise partners around the world. Read on to hear Caitlin’s insights on: GA: Thanks so much for the time today, Caitlin. In your role, you’ve participated in many conversations with our partners who are shifting to remote work. What are some of the top tips you share on leading remote meetings? Caitlin: First and foremost, set a clear agenda with time chunks. If minutes tend not to work for you, then try to estimate time based on the percentage of the meeting you want to spend covering a given topic. Also, keep meeting times manageable and allow for stretch breaks every 30 minutes to allow participants to physically stretch and refocus their attention. As a team leader, you need to model active engagement and bring strong energy to amp up the energy of participants. Second, if there are key decisions that need to be made or input that is required, consider sending a pre-read of materials along with your agenda so participants can come to the meeting prepared. When your meeting comes to a close, name owners of action items and send follow-ups with the highlights of the meeting, and a video recording if available. Follow-ups ensure that everyone is clear on the next steps and can review what was discussed. GA: Staying organized seems to be key! On the flip side, what are some of the top mistakes you see people make when leading remote meetings? Caitlin: When leading remote meetings, try to prevent the “No, you go ahead” loop as I like to call it. As a leader, you need to own facilitation and direct the conversation. This can look like nominating the next person to speak, asking for the opinion of a team member by calling on them, or determining the order of who will speak in advance. This keeps the meeting moving and increases the comfort of team members because expectations are clear. It also prevents lags where no one is responding to broad questions. Then again, get comfortable with some silence. The fidelity of remote meetings can mean that participants need time to think and respond. Don’t rush to fill the silence as participants may just need some time to formulate their thoughts before chiming in. Pauses in conversation can feel less natural in remote meetings and people often fail to leave time for ideation or questions — it’s important to build this in. Name ways participants can contribute, whether that’s asking people to come off mute and speak, inviting comments through the chat, or using the raise hand feature if your conference platform is Zoom. If you have challenges leading the meeting while following the chat, nominate someone to raise any critical questions, and make sure that you build in time to pause and answer instead of interrupting yourself to address comments. GA: I’ve definitely experienced those “No, you go ahead” loops before, and love the tips to address it! Switching gears a little bit, what are some norms you like to use to engage a remote team? Caitlin: Team bonding and preventing feelings of isolation are especially important for teams that are working remotely. Plan to connect through icebreaker introductions or get remote coffee. These may sound corny, but leaning into the corniness can actually unlock a greater sense of connection and make calls feel less like a checklist. One of my favorite icebreakers is to ask participants to quickly hold up something nearby that shows their personality. For example, my pack of stamps is always handy because I love sending mail to friends and family. Teams should also collectively decide on remote working agreements. These can go beyond sharing preferences for communication channels and even include mindsets to adopt as you work together. One example of a working agreement we hold at GA is “Be present,” which means we all agree to minimize multitasking during meetings and practice active engagement. Another example is “Take space, make space,” meaning that as we take time to talk, we also intend to make time for others to speak. GA: Oftentimes, we hear that it’s hard to encourage participation in a remote meeting in the same way you would in a conference room. How do you encourage your team to speak up? Caitlin: Inherently, whoever called a remote meeting feels like the owner, leader, and facilitator of that meeting. To allow individual contributors to feel ownership think about nominating leaders for various meetings and give them a chance to step into a leadership role. Breakout groups can also be a great way to divide large teams into more manageable groups to connect. Zoom has a breakout group feature, but you could also consider smaller sub-groups for projects. Beyond structure, when you’re looking for participants to speak in a given meeting, call on participants by name to share input. You can also message participants ahead of time to preview the specific question and see if they’re comfortable sharing. Knowing your team’s working styles is key, as some people prefer to think through a question on their own rather than respond on the fly. GA: All the insights today have been great so far. One final question for you, Caitlin: What advice can you share around supporting your team during this difficult transition? Caitlin: It’s important to know the channels of communication that work best for your team. For example, if you’ve decided that not everything needs to be a call, think twice before scheduling a call rather than sending an email. Or, if you decided not to email after hours, don’t break your own rule. Also, ask what your employees need. You should check in with your team more frequently than normal to make sure that they feel supported and remain engaged. I’d stress that you should be checking on their goals and if they need support rather than to monitor attendance. A real benefit I see to remote meetings is the many ways for participants to share. Features like a meeting chat can allow more perspectives to surface than in an in-person setting. As we’re all transitioning to more virtual connections, there’s an opportunity to take time to set new norms, make employees feel supported, have fun as a team, and realize that in remote settings, we can still connect. We’re so grateful to Caitlin for sitting down with us to discuss top tips for leading and supporting teams remotely.

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/managing-remote-teams-advice-from-the-experts-part-2-6f54177bebee?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"Key insights from Adi Hanash, VP of Product at Tempest, and Original Remote Program Product Owner at General Assembly. Last week we kicked off our three-part series on managing remote teams. As many companies transition to working from home for the first time to help curb the spread of COVID-19, we wanted to offer some advice to help our community navigate this adjustment. GA has deep experience working with a distributed team and has also helped thousands of learners upskill and reskill through live-online formats. With these things in mind, we’ve tapped into our network of experts to answer top questions we’ve received from our partners, and to share tips and tricks that you can use with your remote teams. For our second segment of this series, we sat down with Adi Hanash, VP of Product at Tempest, an organization focused on building a digital support platform for people recovering from alcohol use disorder. Adi is also a former General Assembly colleague and built the remote learning experience at GA as the original live-online product owner. Adi has transitioned 10 courses to be delivered online and also has 4+ years of experience working remotely himself. Read on to hear Adi’s insights on: GA: Thanks so much for sitting down with us, Adi. We’ve heard from our community that one of the biggest remote work challenges is tracking teams. What is the best way to track attendance and engagement? Adi: There’s a piece to attendance worth addressing that is “How do we know someone’s in the office from nine to five or for the prescribed hours?” Having worked on product teams, we start every morning with a quick check-in to set the goals for the day and then hold an end of day check-in. You need to be comfortable allowing a little bit of freedom to do the work in the middle of the day. Another piece to attendance is making a decision as a team about what it means to be attending a meeting. For me, the number one thing is being on camera. So, if I’m using a video platform, my expectation is everyone who’s in that meeting is on camera for that meeting. If you turn off your camera, I assume you’ve walked out of the room. Being visible also prevents someone from just listening in while doing other work; it forces them to be more present. GA: What do you talk about during those daily check-in meetings? Adi: My product team has a ritual called “stand” that we practice every day. It can be held over a chat platform or in live sessions, but every morning, the team will go around and talk about what they did yesterday, what’s on deck for today, and any blockers or external constraints. At the end of the day, we check-in again and cover what was done that day, any blockers that still exist, and what’s queued up for tomorrow. It’s a really quick check-in that should take 10 to 15 minutes total. The key is to focus not on the meetings or activities a person will have during the day, but the deliverables for the day. That’s where, as the team leader, you can be very clear on what your expectations are for the work that needs to get done. Or, if you are an individual who is now working remotely, you’re aligned with the rest of the team on what your workday entails. It’s a really helpful way to get everyone on the same page and to make sure that you are setting expectations around deliverables — even in this remote environment. GA: How do you get into the work mindset before that “stand” check-in at the start of your day? It’s definitely a little different starting your day from home versus going into the office. Adi: Establish what your rituals are for starting and ending work in your remote environment. This may sound silly, since I know one of the benefits of working from home is being able to be in pajamas all day, but my ritual was that I very consciously decided that when I started work, I put on a collared shirt. I was still in shorts, and that was fine, but the act of putting on the shirt meant I was at work, and the act of taking that shirt off meant I was no longer at work. I’m not saying that’s the right one for you, but I would just encourage everyone to establish rituals. GA: You also mentioned giving the team a little bit of freedom to do the work in the middle of the day. What do you think about flexible work hours when working from home? Adi: The most important thing is to not conflate remote working with flexible working — you have to address them independently of each other. Remote working is the ability to do the work that you have to do from home or in various locations. Flexible work hours mean that you allow a person to set their own schedule for when they are working and when they aren’t. The question of flexible work schedules needs to be addressed in its own way. When I worked remotely, I was working eight hours, but my mistake was spreading those eight hours over 14 hours, which made me feel like I was working the entire day even when I wasn’t. So when you work remotely, you should be very clear on what is okay to do with your schedule in your day (for example, leaving for lunch) and what is not (for example, cleaning). Do not make the mistake of spreading eight hours of work over too long of a period. The way I’ve managed this is to be very clear on my calendar about my scheduled time. You have to create boundaries for yourself and for your team to make this work successfully. GA: What about when you have team members who treat everything as an emergency? How do you deal with that if it falls within an unavailable slot in your schedule? Adi: This can be especially challenging for remote workers. I think the number one thing is defining the levels of emergencies with your teams. There should be some version at the top, which is that the business cannot move forward unless the emergency is solved. If it is a company-wide blocker, then everyone has to stop what they’re doing and help solve the problem. Then down at the bottom, there are things like a typo on the website. At that level, you need to ask, “Is it preventing us from doing anything? How many people have reported it?” Once you get to an understanding of the emergency spectrum, you’d be surprised by how many actually have to be addressed in real-time. So that’s the number one thing I would encourage you to do. GA: What tips do you have for managing and running large format meetings? Adi: The most important thing with any meeting, especially larger ones, is to remind people of the opportunity cost of a meeting, and make it clear that there has to be true value driven by the people in the room. So for example, if you have 15 people in the meeting for 30 minutes, you’re not taking 30 minutes, you’re taking seven and a half hours. And if you start to think about it in terms of time as accumulation, you start to become a lot more judicious as a leader around what type of meetings you want to be calling and who’s going to be involved. Then, if you do decide to proceed with a large format meeting, the number one thing is to have super-clear agendas. You have to be explicit as to what the deliverables for the meeting are. If you cannot define clear deliverables, there are probably better ways to do the meeting than to actually have a meeting. For example, if you need a decision on X, then the meeting attendees have to be defined by who’s responsible for making that decision. So that at the end of the meeting, you’re able to say great, our decision is X. GA: How can you motivate your team members when everyone is remote? Adi: For those of you who are in a leadership position, you need to think about what recognition looks like in a distributed room. It’s very easy to say “Great job!” to an individual, but you need to find the ways to publicize their victories and their wins, and more so in this distributed environment because it’s almost a requirement for them to know that even though they’re on the other end of the computer, their work is having an impact and is being recognized. Chances are, you have some sort of chat platform that you can use. At Tempest we use Slack, and so we have to be creative about how to use it for this purpose. For example, one thing that I love to do with our team is to create a shout-outs time. Every week there’s a certain time where we get onto Slack and just shout out all the victories and wins for the week. Those small ceremonies and rituals help establish the connection, especially with remote employees, that the work they’re doing isn’t being lost to the ether, and that you’re actually seeing it and recognizing it. A huge thanks to Adi for these amazing tips on rituals and leading a remote team. We’re always here for questions, email cheers@ga.co if you’ve got any!

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/managing-remote-teams-advice-from-the-experts-part-1-e6d685b475ea?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Top tips from Matt Brems, Managing Partner at BetaVector, and Global Lead Data Science Instructor at General Assembly There has been an unprecedented shift to remote work as companies and individuals do their part to curb the spread of COVID-19. We’ve heard from our global partners that this shift has been a difficult adjustment and that teams could use some tips and tricks to cultivate connections with their teams and maintain productivity during this uncertain time. General Assembly (GA) has deep remote work experience and has also delivered live online learning to over 5,000 students around the world. With that in mind, we’re sitting down with our experts to get answers to your most pressing questions on managing remote teams and adjusting to work from home. For our first segment of this three-part blog series, we sat down with Matt Brems, Managing Partner at BetaVector and Global Lead Data Science Instructor at General Assembly. Matt has taught 1,000+ students since 2016 and has been working and teaching remotely for the last two and a half years. Read on to hear Matt’s insights on: GA: Matt, thanks so much for being here with us today. To kick things off, what were some of the concerns you had when you started to teach online, and how might these concerns apply to people transitioning to remote work? Matt: Glad to be here! One of the challenges in shifting to an online classroom was that I just didn’t know what the blind spots were going to be. I knew the content I was supposed to teach, but the blind spot was how could I ensure my students’ success when everybody was now connecting remotely. Part of it just took some experience, but really, it was about listening to my students. As a manager, you know the business objectives that you’ve always had. However, you have an additional blind spot: how do you get your team to succeed with the uncertainty of everyone working from home? You have to create space for your team to share what they need and what isn’t working. Then you have to listen to what your team is telling you and act on it. Finally, you need to accept that there will probably be a period where it feels weird and uncomfortable. GA: It sounds like it all worked out! We’ve heard a common blind spot is not knowing how to collaborate with teams remotely. Do you have any tips for managing collaborative work? Matt: When collaborating with others remotely, it’s important to be as explicit as possible. When I started teaching remotely, I would ask vague questions like, “What’s wrong with this?” or “What do you think about that?” Since my questions were vague, my students’ answers were all over the place. That wasn’t a failure on their part, it was a failure on my part. So when it comes to working collaboratively, I have a couple of recommendations. First, break the task down into smaller chunks and make the asks as specific as possible. Let’s say you need your team to write a report by the end of the day. Instead of just putting the ask out there, work with them to divvy it up. I’m not trying to encourage micromanagement, but it’s much easier for communication to break down remotely. People jump into their next meetings, people make assumptions about who does what. Second, be explicit. Instead of using terms like”end of day,” specify what “end of day” is. Does it mean 5 p.m. or midnight? If you’ve got people in different time zones, which time zone? Being explicit, wherever possible, is really helpful. GA: Really great tips. Another blind spot we’ve been hearing frequently is around cultivating a sense of community while remote — how do you manage to keep your team connected? Matt: When it comes to developing that sense of connectedness in the programs that we teach, we start every lesson with an icebreaker. For example, earlier today, my colleague asked, “If you were forced to be part of a talent show, what would your talent be?” This gets people to engage in a fun way and share the things about them that you wouldn’t otherwise know. Think about the “water cooler” talk where people share things that aren’t directly connected to work. We can still do that; we just have to be a bit more creative and intentional about creating that sense of community. As another example, General Assembly develops community by doing daily trivia. Katie, our “trivia guru,” announces a time for trivia, comes up with five trivia questions and then asks them in the trivia Slack channel. People compete to be the first to correctly answer the question. It’s a lot of fun because so many people get really into it. Everybody laughs because some people are right on the money and some people are sharing weird, off-the-beaten-path answers. We’re leaning into everything that we would do in-person to build that community; we just have to be more intentional about it when we’re remote. GA: To expand on culture even further, what advice do you have for creating norms for your remote teams? Matt: To come up with norms, start with a shared blank document and let everyone contribute their thoughts about what’s important. Then transition to discussing these thoughts in a meeting and have people come to a consensus on norms for the group. Specifically, you want to provide a safe space for people to share what they need out of your team environment, and you want to make space for people who have different experiences than you might have. I want to be abundantly clear about this: Once the team agrees on a norm, everybody needs to follow it. And that includes leaders. There is sometimes this tendency for people in leadership to say, “Hey, we established the team norms, but that’s for everybody else. Because I’m a leader, I don’t necessarily have to abide by that.” That can be the quickest way for norms to deteriorate. Being clear and making sure everybody adheres to the norms is huge. GA: A lot of people have children or parents to take care of in addition to working from home — what are your thoughts on flex hours as part of those team norms? Matt: I think that’s really important right now. Everybody needs to come together and be flexible and empathetic because this is a difficult time for a lot of people. Recognize that maybe somebody will be able to do good work from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. before their kids get up, and then there are times during the day when they need to take breaks to play with their kids, and then they’ll be ready to hop back on later in the evening. This ties directly into setting team norms. Norms can include being explicit about the hours that people are available, as opposed to assuming that everybody is still going to be on the nine to five office schedule while at home. In my opinion, assuming that what you did in the office will simply work at home is one of the quickest ways to set yourself up for failure. GA: On the flip side, how do you set boundaries with family while you’re working, given remote work and home life coexist in the same place? Matt: With my fiancé, we had to have very direct conversations about what worked for us and what didn’t. For example, I said “If you come home and my headphones are in, just wave at me but go into the other room. If I’m able to talk to you, I will take my headphones out and come talk to you.” Some people recommend even having a little sign, like a yes/no sign. If it says yes, you can come up and tap them on the shoulder, but if they flip it and it says no, don’t bother them at that moment. That can be really important. GA: One final question. We know that working from home can be stressful, especially when juggling family obligations and health concerns. What advice do you have for people who are having those feelings right now? Matt: It is very common and normal for people to feel stressed, to feel isolated, or to feel upset about what’s going on. I read on Twitter recently that this isn’t a normal working from home scenario… we’re working from home during a crisis. I have worked from home for almost 2.5 years, and I still feel like something is fundamentally different, given all that’s going on in the news. One of the things that I personally believe is that community is really, really important. And it’s possible to have community with one another, even if you’re not physically in the same room. With my fiancé, we sat down with his parents and did a virtual drink. For the first three minutes, it felt bizarre to talk with people on a computer screen, but after a few minutes, you don’t even notice that they’re not in the room. Virtual connections can happen with family, friends, colleagues and co-workers to the extent that you want. Leaning into my community has been really cathartic for me, and hope that it is for many of you too. A huge thanks to Matt for taking the time to sit down with us to share his remote work tips and tricks. As we adjust our everyday lives to our ever-changing world, it’s helpful to know that our sense of work, community, and work/life balance does not have to be compromised.

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/how-to-teach-online-de0e565c4e98?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"As the spread of COVID-19 continues to transform daily life around the world, we at General Assembly have been paying close attention to how the virus is upending education: And this is only the beginning — we are entering a new world of work that will look radically different as the pandemic progresses. Last year alone, we saw a 141% spike in enrollment in GA’s full-time remote programs. In some ways, the rise of online learning means that education providers are better-equipped than ever to respond to these changes. Schools are rapidly implementing online programs, video conferencing has never been more sophisticated, and hundreds of thousands of students are logging on to continue their studies virtually. But the reality is that converting to an online learning environment isn’t as simple as clicking a button. As Kevin Carey put it in The New York Times, colleges are quickly realizing that “it’s impossible to transform a college course into a virtual world overnight,” — and that teaching and learning don’t always work the same way online as they do in person. At General Assembly, we are grappling with this challenge as well: We recently made the decision to bring all of our in-person Immersive courses online to support more than 5,500students globally. The good news is that online learning isn’t new to us. We’ve learned a lot from facilitating online programs for over 4 years, and hope to share those challenges — and opportunities — with institutions around the globe as they enter this new and confusing world. That’s why we’re offering free access to How To Teach Online to anyone. This short-form course — led by one of our resident experts in online instruction, Maria Weaver — is specifically designed for instructors transitioning to a remote format.Whether you’re a seasoned online instructor or a first-time Zoom user, sign up to access new tools, discover essential resources, and gain best practices for impactful online instruction, including how to: In uncertain times like these, it’s more important than ever to share knowledge and experience with those who can benefit from it. This course has helped hundreds of our instructors acquire the basic skills and techniques needed to lead effective online classrooms, and we hope it provides the same value for other instructors out there. Our team is committed to making more of our resources and expertise readily available to the global education community, and we see this as an initial, small step in that direction.

Our eye-opening analysis revealed there was a digital skills gap in marketing driven by missing data skills across channels. We also uncovered that top talent often existed outside the marketing function and that seniority — at least below the VP level — didn’t predict a skills advantage in digital marketing. Nearly two years later, we’ve set out to provide an in-depth look at marketing capabilities and skills gaps with the publication of our new white paper, The State of Skills: Marketing 2020. To develop our latest report, we analyzed over 20,000 users across dozens of countries and numerous industries who took the Certified Marketer Level 1 (CM1) assessment between October 2018 and November 2019. We’ve also combed through significant CM1 data to determine how assessment-takers performed across five essential topics — consumer/customer insights, creative development, channels and execution, measurement and analytics, and marketing technology — and how those scores varied across role, work experience, and other areas. Launched in October 2018 and created in partnership with the Marketing Standards Board, CM1 reflects a shift from thinking about “digital marketing” as a discipline in itself, toward thinking about the broad set of competencies marketers need to succeed in the digital age. Building on the DM1 assessment, CM1 guides development of critical marketing skills that align with the foundational competencies of our Marketing Career Framework, and enables high scorers to earn the industry-recognized CM1 Credential. Today, leading companies use our assessment to benchmark their teams’ skills, prospect talent, and prescribe literacy, upskilling, and reskilling programs based on assessment performance. The State of Skills: Marketing 2020 includes key insights from some of these global industry leaders, and highlights both opportunities and challenges for organizations grappling with today’s changing marketing landscape. After analyzing CM1 data for thousands of individuals, as well as the job function, seniority, and education levels for 3,300 users who self-reported information about their positions, here’s what we found. While the key takeaways that emerged from our CM1 analysis revealed some persistent trends, they also build on our 2018 findings, offering new data for companies looking to digitally transform and advance their marketing organizations. They also guided us toward some insightful conclusions — actionable next steps for companies aiming to transform marketers with cutting-edge, competitive skills that enable business success and drive value. For a deeper dive into these takeaways and the data we analyzed — including the questions and topics where CM1 assessment-takers shined (and struggled) — read the entire report here.

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/what-its-really-like-to-change-your-career-online-4cb807852e68?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"Going to work used to mean physically traveling to a workplace. Whether by foot, public transit, or car — a job was a specific location to which you commuted. But with the advent of the gig economy and advances in technology, telecommuting has become more and more prevalent. In fact, according to a 2018 study, approximately 70% of workers worldwide spend at least one day a week working from home. So, why should education be any different? Learning from the comfort of home saves you the time and money you would’ve spent commuting, allows you to spend more time with loved ones, and encourages a much more comfortable, casual work environment. That’s why we’re now offering all of our career-changing Immersives online. We’ve transformed over 11K+ careers — so whether you’re interested in becoming a software engineer, data scientist, or UX designer, you can trust our proven curriculum, elite instructors, and dedicated career coaches to set you up for professional success. We sat down with three experts on GA’s Immersive Remote programs to better understand how they work — and more importantly — how they compare to the on-campus experience. GA Education Product Manager Lee Almegard explained the reasoning behind the move: “At GA, the ability to pay tuition, commute to class, or coordinate childcare shouldn’t be a barrier to launching a new career,” she said. “Our new 100% remote Immersive programs are designed to ease these barriers.” Obviously, saving yourself a trip to campus is appealing on many levels, but some interested students expressed concern that they wouldn’t receive enough personalized attention studying online as opposed to IRL. Instructor Matt Huntington reassures them, saying “Our lectures are highly interactive, and there is ample time to ask questions — not only of the teacher but also of other students.” It’s not always easy to stay focused in a traditional classroom, but when your fellow students have been replaced by a curious toddler or Netflix is only a click away, distraction is a real concern. GA graduate Alex Merced shared these worries when he began his Software Engineering Immersive Remote program, but they quickly disappeared. “The clever use of Slack and Zoom really made the class engaging. It leverages the best features of both platforms, such as polls, private channels, and breakout rooms,” he said. “This kept the class kinetic, social, and engaging, versus traditional online training that usually consists of fairly non-interactive lectures over PowerPoint.” If you’re concerned about staying focused, you can use these simple, impactful tips to stay motivated and on track to meet your goals: Most importantly, listen to yourself. Everyone learns differently, so take stock of what works best for you. Find the strategies that fit your learning style, and you’ll be well on your way to new skills and new heights. Another key component of learning is the camaraderie that comes from meeting and studying with like-minded students. How does that translate to a virtual classroom? GA Career Coach Ruby Sycamore-Smith explains that both students and faculty can have meaningful, productive relationships without ever meeting in person. “We’re a lot more intentional online,” she says. “You’re not able to just bump into each other in the corridor as you would on campus, but that means you’re able to be a lot more purposeful with your time when you do connect — way beyond a simple smile and a wave.” Merced agrees. “Breakout sessions allowed me to assist and be assisted by my classmates, with whom I’ve forged valuable relationships. Now I have friends all over the world.” And as Huntington pointed out, “There is no back of the classroom when you’re online.” When you learn remotely, every seat is right next to all of your peers. “When we piloted the Software Engineering Remote bootcamp, we took extra care to make sure that our virtual classrooms felt exactly like the on-campus ones, with group labs and even special projects to ensure students are constantly working with each other,” Huntington explained. “A lot of our students form after-hours homework groups, and nighttime TAs create study hall video conferences so everyone can see and talk to each other.” And with students from all over the country, you’re going to connect with people you never would’ve met within the confines of a classroom. These peers could even be the very contacts who help you get you hired. She says, “Career preparation sessions are very discussion-based and collaborative, as all of our students have varied backgrounds. Some are recent college graduates, others may have had successful careers and experienced a number of job hunts previously. Everyone has unique ideas and insights to share, so we use these sessions to really connect and learn from one another.” Merced is enthusiastic about his GA experience and quickly landed a great job as a developer. “Finding work was probably the area I was most insecure about going into the class,” he confessed. “But the prep sessions really made the execution and expectations of a job search much clearer and I was able to land firmly on my feet.” After years of teaching in front of a brick-and-mortar classroom, Huntington was a little wary about his move to digital instructor, but his misgivings quickly gave way. “I was surprised to feel just as close to my virtual students as I did to my on-campus students,” he said. “Closing down our virtual classrooms and saying goodbye on the last day of class is so much more heart-wrenching online than it ever was for me when I taught on campus.” Huntington’s advice to a student wondering if online learning is right for them: “Go for it! It’s just like in person, but there’s no commute and it’s socially acceptable to wear pajamas!” Learn About Our Immersive Remote Programs Originally published at https://generalassemb.ly on March 4, 2020.

https://medium.com/the-ga-index/putting-the-future-of-work-in-a-global-context-854872476a9c?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"Today’s workforce is not just changing. It’s undergoing a seismic shift that, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, “is happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale, or roughly 3,000 times the impact” compared to the Industrial Revolution. The reality is that professionals grapple with a volatile economy where the shelf-life of skills is shrinking, hybrid jobs are increasing, and fears about automation’s disruptive impact on the job market make headlines every week. In the U.S., despite surging stocks and historic GDP growth, people’s incomes and wages haven’t kept up and income inequality continues to accelerate. Around the globe, governments and employers alike recognize that areas such as AI and automation are quickly reshaping the workplace. And the gap between the skills workers have and the skills companies need is growing wider as workers struggle to keep pace with emerging technologies in fast-growing industries. In my role at General Assembly, I get the opportunity to speak with U.S. policymakers and analysts who grapple with employment and workforce development issues, and formulate solutions to ensure Americans can succeed in the new world of work. In these conversations, examples of education and workforce investment models spearheaded in other cities and countries often come up, and how we might repurpose them. Global training providers like GA are also partnering with organizations to craft upskilling and reskilling programs that arm professionals with cutting-edge skills, and also generate creative sources for talent in an increasingly competitive market. We know technology is transforming the global workforce. What’s less clear is how this transformation will take place — and what policymakers, learning and development providers, and business leaders should be doing to prepare for it. In our new white paper, which we developed in collaboration with Whiteboard Advisors and features a foreword from former Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Seth Harris, we uncover a lot of useful insights about how the U.S. and other industrialized nations are navigating these employment and workforce issues. Our study examines the experiences and policy initiatives of six countries — Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Singapore, and Switzerland — and their strategies to improve upskilling, economic mobility, and employability in an evolving, and, at times, turbulent marketplace. While the U.S. economy and labor market have unique characteristics, we discovered there are lessons to be learned from other developed economies pursuing workforce development programs and initiatives. For example, we examine Australia’s Vocational Education and Training (VET) program, which provides government support toward helping people pursue non-college skills training. Or, consider Germany’s Dual Training System, where companies partner with publicly-funded vocational schools to provide job training. As American politicians, educators, and business leaders, we must ask ourselves: How can the startling impact of these innovative approaches be applied within a U.S. context? It’s a question industry stakeholders and experts have posed to General Assembly with increased frequency since we were acquired by The Adecco Group in April 2018. As the largest human capital solutions company in the world, The Adecco Group is an active participant in the highly successful Swiss apprenticeship model, a government-led initiative that provides young Swiss professionals paid apprenticeships designed in partnership with Swiss companies, and that’s recognized around the world as a paradigm for work-based learning. Putting the Future of Work in a Global Context offers a high-level analysis of these and other examples of skill- and employability-building initiatives in industrialized nations, as well as a few observations: Today’s increasingly global workplace demands a more nuanced, comprehensive understanding of the different ways governments and industries are addressing and responding to economic mega trends. Our hope is that this paper can begin a conversation about the lessons, ideas, and insights that other countries have to share with U.S. policymakers, employers, and practitioners on how to respond to and anticipate the future of work.

https://medium.com/@sihui/the-other-side-of-technical-skill-domain-knowledge-and-long-term-vision-7db0602755da?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"When we first start our careers as software engineers, we tend to focus on improving our coding skills, a.k.a. technical skills. This includes, but is not limited to, mastering a specific tech stack, adopting best practices, and studying architecture designs. But there is another side that is just as important: gaining the domain knowledge and forming a long-term vision for your team, product, and company. I’m leading a multi-quarter project that requires collaboration among several engineering teams. My team has been the ultimate initiator and driver of the project. As more and more senior engineers from other teams have joined, I started to wonder if I was still qualified to lead the project. After hearing my concerns, my manager pointed out something I neglected: the importance of domain knowledge and a long-term vision. I was not the most experienced engineer on the project, but I had the most context and domain knowledge. The project is most related to my team’s current domain, and I have been working in this area for a long time. The domain knowledge I gained over time leads to a long-term vision. Both the domain knowledge and long-term vision are critical to the success of the project. The importance of gaining domain knowledge and forming a long-term vision is rarely discussed, especially compared with the level of emphasis we put on improving technical skills.

https://medium.com/@sihui/how-to-handle-disagreements-and-conflicts-at-work-a6654e15632c?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Have you ever experienced the embarrassment of feeling so certain about your opinion and then later being proved wrong? Well, this has happened many times in my career. Feelings related to this kind of event stay fresh for a long time. The more certain I was in the beginning, the more embarrassed I felt when I realized I wasn’t totally right. It’s common to have disagreements among engineers. Disagreements present great opportunities to learn from each other and innovate on better approaches. Being wrong is nothing to be embarrassed about. What embarrassed me was my arrogance and stubbornness that made me assume I was right and others were wrong without even first hearing their arguments. Something similar happened last week. Although I was thrilled by the outcome of the discussion, I once again made the mistake of assuming my approach was right. In the end, I felt embarrassed by my arrogance and stubbornness. I decided to use this opportunity to take a closer look at the issue, combine my experiences with advice from resources I came across, and come up with a recipe for handling disagreements and conflicts at work. Or, I should say, a recipe for being more open-minded and less stubborn. This post includes: A teammate and I had a disagreement about the approach to take for a task. In the beginning, I was so certain that I was right and he was wrong that I was impatient and interrupted him multiple times while he was making his case. As his viewpoint unfolded, I understood that each of our approaches had its advantages and disadvantages. After a long discussion, we came up with a new approach that combined the advantages of the two approaches we originally had in mind. The new approach not only drastically reduced the amount of development time required but also improved the overall design of the system. I was so thrilled by the new approach that I kept talking about it with a big smile on my face for the rest of the day. Besides the euphoria generated from the collaborative, creative problem-solving process, I also felt deeply embarrassed by my initial attitude when my teammate first raised his disagreement with my approach. If, instead of trying to see the other person’s point of view, my teammate and I insisted that the original approach each of us had was better than the other person’s, we might’ve kept talking in circles without going anywhere. The new approach might have never arrived. We would have been so busy arguing with each other that we’d have no time to innovate and solve the problem like a team. When you are certain you are right, you leave no room for different opinions. You close the possibility that there’s a better way out there. You cannot improve and innovate when you are close-minded. You risk missing out the opportunity to discover a better approach. Another worst case scenario is, because of your stubbornness, you cannot hear a word from your teammate. If all you do is express your own opinions without listening to your teammates’ arguments, you might be able to convince your teammate you are right… but They will walk away feeling they haven’t been heard and their opinions aren’t valued. These negative emotions hurt the team’s morale and make future collaboration harder and less fun. Disagreements are inevitable. Unless you only work with clones of yourself, there will be disagreements. There are two fundamentally different mindsets to approach disagreements. This was my default mindset towards disagreements. With this mindset, when a disagreement came up, naturally, I became a bit frustrated and impatient. While the other party was making their case, I always had an urge to interrupt them because I wanted to convince them and tried to finish the discussion as fast as possible. I tended to have lots of mixed feelings at the beginning of a disagreement. I felt the pressure to prove that I’m right, the pressure from the false urgency in my mind, the urge to interrupt people, and the guilt from being rude. As a result, I never enjoyed the beginning of a discussion triggered by disagreements. This is a more positive mindset. Disagreements are gifts because the process of resolving them might inspire better and more innovative solutions. Ultimately, disagreements come from either the different experiences we have in the past with related subjects or the different priorities we have in mind. As a result, disagreements are great opportunities to learn from each other and get on the same page. Approaching disagreements as gifts automatically sets you in a positive mood when disagreements come up. It makes discussions more enjoyable and helps you get more value out of them. After we adopt a positive mindset towards disagreements, here are the concrete steps we can follow to resolve them. If you are like me and tend to be impatient at the beginning of the discussion, check with yourself to see if you are trying to rush through it. If so, ask yourself if there is really a need to rush. Is the sense of urgency from the project itself, or it was triggered by you wanting to defend your position? Most discussions take about 40 to 90 mins. Most of the time, things are not that urgent and you can afford the time. As we discussed above, the worst case is, because of your false sense of urgency and defensiveness, your teammate doesn’t feel heard during the discussion. Maybe it simply doesn’t matter which approach you go with. The significance of the matter determines how much time it’s worth spending on the discussion. The tricky thing is you and your teammates might disagree on its significance. If that’s the case, time box the discussion and follow the next steps. When you don’t see the significance but your teammates hold strong opinions, you should give this matter more attention and hear your teammates out. After all, you should never assume you are right. As silly as it sounds, we often treat our own beliefs as if they are facts. When we assume we are right and others are wrong, we are attached to our opinions and find it hard to listen to others’ with an open mind. It’s hard to convince ourselves we are wrong when disagreements first rise. We are so familiar with our own opinions that they always seem to be obviously true. The 80–20 Rule of Conflict from Positive Intelligence is helpful in such cases. Here is the definition from the book with small modifications. The 80–20 Rule of Conflict: When differences arise, we tend to ask “which one of us is right”. This question is not helpful because a) it divides people into groups where each group feels the urge to defend their positions and prove other positions are wrong, and b) it also frames the discussion to be about picking a solution among the given set of presented solutions. “Why do we see this differently” is a better question to ask. This question turns the discussion into a collaborative investigation where the group works together with one common goal in mind — to better understand each other’s position and reasonings. Positive Intelligence presents The Iceberg of Conflict: When we ask “why do we see this differently”, we dive deeper into the Assumptions level and Aspirations level. Assumptions and aspirations are the underlying reasons that form our positions. When we discuss our assumptions and aspirations, we can understand why the other party holds such positions. Sometimes we hold different positions because we have different assumptions. When we address the assumptions directly, it becomes clear to both parties which position, if any, makes sense. Sometimes we see things differently because we have different priorities and try to achieve different things. When we examine the underlying priorities and motives directly, we understand where each other coming from. If these priorities and motives are compatible, we might even be able to come up with a better solution that satisfies both parties’ priorities and motives. That was the case last week. My teammate’s underlying motive for his approach was to avoid unnecessary manual work and speed up the project. And my motive was to avoid introducing further couplings between two systems. After our motives were out in the air, we came up with a new approach that satisfied both. It’s worth emphasizing again: make sure your teammates feel heard. Making sure your teammates feel heard is critical for your relationship with your teammates, the team’s morale, and the ongoing success of the project. If you tend to talk over others in discussions, the best way to make sure this is to, literally, force yourself to shut up and listen for two minutes. To be honest, I don’t expect to get rid of my stubbornness in one day. I will try out this recipe and update here with new findings. I would love to hear what has worked for you and your team as well. 🙂 My career plan for the year is to grow into a tech lead. I’m excited about all the learnings ahead and would love to share this journey with you in a brutally honest fashion. I will be sharing my weekly learnings on my personal blog (Not Medium).

We all crave a feeling of importance. Dale Carnegie claims that This is also true for work — we want to be the M.V.P. (Most Valuable Player) of our team. The sense of importance provides meaning and motivation. At the same time, it also feeds our ego. After all, Marvel movies are popular for a reason — deep down, at some point in time, we all want to be heroes. The word “responsibility” gives me mixed feelings. In this post, I share: On one hand, the word “responsibility” reminds me of my importance and motivates me to produce great work. It feeds my ego and makes me feel good. On the other hand, it brings me stress. Feeling things depending on me sometimes weighs me down and even makes me paranoid. I’ve lost many nights of sleep to questions like: “What if we can’t deliver the project on time?” or “There are so many unknowns; how can I know if everything will be fine?”. I would be restless until the project was almost done because I felt responsible for it. There’s no way to know for sure things would go well until they happened. This way of thinking, using responsibilities at work to feed my ego and allowing them to interfere with my life, served me well at the beginning of my career. It motivated me to produce lots of good work and push projects across the finish line. "
https://medium.com/free-code-camp/when-to-refactor-legacy-code-vs-when-to-stay-focused-on-your-current-project-fda99919cc34?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"When I work on projects, I often run into legacy code that can be improved — to be more readable, more testable, or more compliant with the current coding style. My urge to refactor the code is especially strong after spending a good amount of time trying to understand a piece of obscure code. That code hurts my brain, and I don’t want the same thing to happen to other developers. There is (the adaptation of) the famous Boy Scout Rule: Leave Code Better than You Found It. But at the same time, I also want to stay focused and make progress on my current projects. I worry that I might get distracted and spend too much time refactoring. This is a dilemma I often face. I want to be the good samaritan leaving code better than I found it, an engineer turning all the messy code I come across into something clean and elegant. But I also want to stay pragmatic and ship projects quickly. Balancing between refactoring the legacy code I come across and staying focused on my current project can be hard. A recent conversation with my manager on this topic provided me guidance to find that balance. Here are a few points I find helpful. After I read a piece of legacy code, my brain immediately thinks about how it should be ideally. But refactoring that code from its current state to the ideal state sometimes requires an extensive refactoring. At its best, the required refactoring can be time-consuming. At its worst, it can turn into a rabbit hole that causes a big delay on the project. When I face cases like this, I used to either take a chance and do the extensive refactoring anyway or hold my nose and let the code stay stinky. Now I realize there is a happy middle point: I don’t have the make the code perfect. I can spend as much or as little time as I can afford to make the code a bit better. Small improvements I do can be still useful for the developers that come next. And those developers may have time to improve the code further, building upon the improvements I make. (PS: There’s no perfect nor ideal code. The moment you make a change, you see more improvements you can make.) Time-boxing is a great technique to avoid rabbit holes. Before starting to refactor, do a quick estimation about how much time you can spend on refactoring legacy code without delaying the project too much. Write that number down. Time-boxing your refactoring gives you the peace of mind knowing the main project will stay on track. And that makes the refactoring experience more enjoyable. Things can be even easier if you bake the refactoring time into the project estimation before starting a project. While estimating how much time a project might take, take a quick look at the code you need to touch: when was it first written? How readable and extensible is it? How much test coverage does it have? Unless there’s a hard requirement about when the project needs to be shipped, you should bake some refactoring time into the project’s timeline. After all, as we keep building upon a legacy codebase, refactoring it as we go is the best way to keep it healthy. And a healthy codebase, in turn, makes building new features faster and safer. Refactoring a piece of code is the best way to understand it. Compared to staying aloof and just reading a piece of code, coming in and modifying it gives you a much deeper and intimate relationship with the code. When you try to add your touch to the code, you will start to notice things you missed before. You may see the constraints and may even understand why the author originally wrote the code this way. Although refactoring a piece of code doesn’t seem to add any immediate value to the business, it’s an opportunity for you to gain a piece of domain knowledge you currently don’t have. Gaining that domain knowledge is invaluable to both you and the business. The more you do it, the faster you become. One last reason to refactor legacy code is to use it as an opportunity to strengthen your “refactoring muscle”. Investing in building your “refactoring muscle” has a self-reinforcing compound effect: the more you refactor, the better you are at refactoring, making your next refactoring faster. The more you do it, the better the codebase is, making building future features faster. Luckily, my next project relates to code from almost three years ago. I expect to face many cases requiring me to balance between refactoring legacy code and making progress on the project. I will share my new learning on my personal blog (NOT medium).

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/never-feel-overwhelmed-at-work-again-how-to-use-the-m-i-t-technique-70d132aad0cc?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"Have you ever felt exhausted after a day at work? At the end of a busy day, you couldn’t remember how you spent your time. All you knew was that there was more to be done tomorrow. You were tired, overwhelmed, and even a bit frustrated — the to-do list always out-ran you. You might have wanted to review your day and see how to be more productive. But the pain you had in your head from a long day was so strong that all you could do was drag yourself home and collapse on a couch until it’s time for bed. The next day, the same story repeats and it’s a never ending cycle. That was my life over the past few months. As my role evolves, coding is no longer my sole responsibility. My days often consist of a mix of interviewing, various meetings, code reviews, ad-hoc discussions, and coding. Often, at the end of a day, I feel like a failure because I didn’t make as much progress on my project as I had wanted to. All I could think of was all the remaining work that needed to be done, which could be discouraging since I never seemed to be able to get to the bottom of the to-do list. This troubled me for a long time. I knew objectively that I worked harder than ever. After a day of hard work, I deserve to feel accomplished and proud. Things changed after I discovered the M.I.T. technique: a powerful way to keep me focused and productive throughout the day. Here is how I apply it to my day-to-day work. After I get to the office, first thing in the morning, I open my note-taking app (I use Workflowy). First off, I start a new section for the day and write down two to three most important tasks I want to focus on and get done under the M.I.T. section. Then I list out tasks, both M.I.T.s and non-M.I.T.s, in the order I plan to do them under the log section. I then check my schedule for the day and plan blocks of time for the M.I.T.s. I will try to get them done as soon as possible. Lastly, before actually starting to work, I tell myself as long as I get the most important tasks (M.I.T.s) done, it’s a productive day that I should be proud of. Finishing these tasks is my definition of success for the day. Here’s an example of how my note will look like: As the day goes, new tasks come in. According to their urgency and importance, I add them to the log section. Here is how it might look like in the middle of the day: My M.I.T.s for the day are flexible and can change. It’s totally fine if I need to swap a M.I.T. with a new one or even decide to not work on it and move it to another day altogether. At the end of the day, I will update the progress of all the tasks, especially the M.I.T.s, and leave a note for tomorrow. Here is how it might look like at the end of the day: It feels great to be able to see all the tasks you worked on and how you spend your time at the end of a hard working day. (I also create a Google calendar event to log how I spend my time after I finish a task.) There are other areas in which I can improve my productivity and achieve better work-life balance while getting more done. I will explore and experiment with different techniques and share them on my personal blog (not Medium) when I find something interesting. Subscribe if you’re interested and don’t want to miss out!

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-fastest-way-to-get-promoted-as-an-engineer-dd0c1399587a?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"We all want to live up to our potential, grow in our career, and do the best work of our lives. Getting promoted at work not only proves that we have advanced our skills but also shows that the hard work we put in is being recognized and appreciated. As I was going through my bi-annual performance review with my manager, I learned that I missed that one thing that could have helped me grow faster and would’ve led to a promotion. The fastest way to get promoted at work — act as if you have already been promoted. If you want to be promoted to be a level 6 engineer, start to think and act like a level 6 engineer. If you want to become a tech lead, start to think and act like as if you are already a tech lead. Observe the types of work engineers at the next level do that are different than yours, and start looking for opportunities to take on those types of activities. Ask your manager about the expectations for the next level, and start to work on meeting those expectations. You can even work out a reasonable target date for your promotion with your manager and plan backward from that date. Here is my story. In the past six months, my responsibilities at work grew a lot and my role changed gradually. Before, I was a pure individual contributor. My main focus at work was to read, write and talk about code. In the last six months, I acquired new responsibilities, such as leading projects, facilitating technical discussions, leading cross-team collaborations, and onboarding new team members. While these new responsibilities provided a tremendous amount of growth opportunities, I was one step behind in recognizing the changes in my role and the new exceptions from my team. For example, one piece of feedback I received was that while facilitating technical discussions, I should make sure we stay on topic and not get lost in details. My first reaction when I heard the feedback was that I didn’t even realize I was the facilitator for the discussion. I thought I was just a participant providing technical expertise. Another bit of feedback I got was to focus more on the big picture and overall timeline of a project instead of only the part that was right in front of me. The feedback makes sense. After all, a major responsibility for a tech lead is to monitor projects’ progress and communicate them in a timely manner to external stakeholders. But in my mind, I was still thinking of myself as an individual contributor. Even though I knew I was leading the project, I was late to recognize all these new expectations and responsibilities. In other words, I was acting like an engineer at my current level, instead of a tech lead, the next level I wanted to grow into. This way of thinking — acting like you are one step ahead of yourself, or “fake it till you make it”, is applicable to many other things besides getting promotions. Many self-taught developers tell me they aren’t sure if they have learned enough to be a professional developer. My answer is always to act like you are ready and apply for jobs — that’s the only way to find out. This is a simple but powerful mental shift. I will start applying it at work and post updates on my personal blog (not Medium) reporting how it goes. Subscribe to follow along. I hope to see you next week in your inbox :) My career plan for the year is to grow into a tech lead. I’m excited about all the learnings ahead and would love to share this journey with you in a brutally honest fashion. I will be sharing my weekly learnings on my personal blog (not Medium).

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/design-patterns-command-and-concierge-in-life-and-ruby-aab9815817ea?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"The Command Pattern’s definition is a stressful one to look at. The formal definition is that it: Let’s forget about it for a second and take a trip to Hawaii. And live in a luxury hotel. We spent the day on the beach, scuba dived, and did some sightseeing. It’s time to get back to the hotel to chill, eat, and plan for the next day. After getting back to the hotel, we want to: We check out the hotel’s service menu and find three service items matching our needs. We then call the front desk to place these three requests. A concierge picks up our call, writes down our list of requests, and acts on each service request as instructed by the service menu. Then each staff member executes according to each specific request: Let’s recap what just happened. a. We selected the services we wanted from the menu and submitted them to a concierge. b. The concierge wrote these service requests down as a list. c. After we hung up, instructed by the service menu, the concierge sent our requests to corresponding departments. d. Each department executed on the given request. 1. We submitted these three requests to the concierge: 2. These requests went into a list the concierge keeps track of: Let’s see that in action (console): As we can see, after we submitted three requests, these requests were in a request_list taking care by concierge. 3. Instructed by the service menu, the concierge sent our requests to corresponding departments. The code above should work fine. Except for one thing…. It smells bad. Specifically, the part where we have the switch cases: Why does this part smell bad? The method knows too much and requires frequent changes. Having these two combinations together is almost always a bad thing. Why? A method that requires frequent changes is a method you need to update often. Each time you update a piece of code is an opportunity to introduce new bugs to the system. When the method also knows a ton — and it’s long — the chances of messing it up when updating increases significantly. That’s the reasoning behind a design principle we talked about earlier — encapsulate what varies. There must be a better way than this: Take a closer look and think about it. Let’s rephrase what the code is doing in English. We loop through the requests on the request list. For each request, according to its service type, we give the corresponding department related data and execute the request. Essentially, we loop through the requests and execute each of them accordingly. But what if each request actually knew how to execute itself? Then the method can be as simple as: Instead of letting the act_on_requests method decide how each request should be handled, we distribute that responsibility and knowledge back to each request and let it decide how to itself should be handled. With that being said, our requests could look like this: And the updated Concierge will look like: With the updated codes, here is how we, customers of the hotel, send requests to the concierge. It is pretty easy to create another service. For example, the hotel also allows us to reserve SPA: The service not only supports execute (making a spa reservation) but also undo (canceling the reservation). Let’s say the hotel also provides another way to request services without having to call the concierge — a service requesting panel: We can just press the button and the service with a default setting will be delivered to our room. Here is the code for the ServicePanel: And here is how we can create a service panel: Let’s revisit the definition of the Command Pattern. It: Each of the services classes we created, RoomService, LaundryService, TripPlanningService, and SpaReservationService, is an example of encapsulating a request as an object. Recap: The ServicePanel is an example of parameterizing an object with different requests. Recap: Our requests were queued while the concierge was taking them over the phone. Recap: SpaReservationService supports undo. Recap: Thanks for reading! Don’t forget to subscribe. :D This was originally published on my blog, Design patterns in life and Ruby. "
https://medium.com/free-code-camp/lets-talk-about-you-and-the-singleton-design-pattern-bb2e160fa952?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"This might be the most important post in my Design patterns in life and Ruby series, because this one is about YOU. Before anything, you need to listen to this song: No, I’m serious. The song is less than 2 minutes. Listen to the song before you read any further. Let’s take a look at the lyrics of the song: You’re in a class by yourself, you’re one of a kind, and you’re the one and only one! This uniqueness is exactly what the Singleton pattern is about! Definition of the Singleton pattern: The second part of the criteria is easy to fulfill — basically any class can provide a global point of access. But a simple class like this does not ensure that the class only has one instance: We can easily create two different instances of you. It’s because the new method, the method for creating instances for the class, is public. To prevent having multiple instances of the class, we can try to mark the new method private, so no one outside of the class has access to the method — unless you really go out of your way and use You.send('new'). You can always call .send(method_name) to invoke a private method in Ruby, if you really want to go against the will of the author of the code. But then we can’t create an instance of the class at all! Why don’t we create an instance from inside the class and open a point of access to the outside world? (In Ruby, @@ indicates the variable is a class variable.) Now there is a way to access the instance created within the class: Both criteria of the Singleton pattern’s definition have been met: We just wrote a simple example of the Singleton pattern! There are many advantages of using the Singleton pattern. One of them is lazy initialization: In the above code, we don’t initialize the instance until the first time LazyYou.instance is called which is the first time the instance is needed. Now you have a basic understanding of the Singleton pattern. Next time when you try to ensure a class only has a single instance, you can consider this pattern. And when you are down, remind yourself that you are the one and only one and the things that make you different are the things that make you you :) Don’t forget to subscribe so you won’t miss the next post!

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/using-the-simple-factory-design-pattern-is-a-lot-like-making-cheesecake-92a119cde191?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"The Video Version of This is Up! — Factory Patterns are about encapsulating object creation. But before diving into details of the patterns, let’s talk about cheesecake. Because cheesecake is about … happiness! 😝😋😍 Let’s focus our gaze on six of my personal favorites: Original Cheesecake, Ore0 Cheesecake, Coffee Cheesecake, Tiramisu Cheesecake, S’mores Cheesecake, and Hazelnut Cheesecake. And here is how we make a cheesecake: Create a cheesecake instance based on the selected type -> Make crust -> Add layers on top of the crust -> Bake it -> Refrigerate it -> Add toppings to the cake -> Return the cake! 🍰🍰🍰 Wait … that Mango key lime cheesecake looks very tempting 🤔🤔🤔. Let me add it to my list: One second … I have been having too much caffeine lately. I don’t want the coffee cheesecake to be on my list anymore. Let me update the make_cheesecake method again. Oooh…. they have a low carb version of cheesecake. It’s always nice to have a low carb option. It needs to be on my list! So since the first time we defined make_cheesecake, we have updated it three times. Each time, the change was for the exact same reason — to update my cheesecake list. And everything else, make_crust, add_layers, bake, refrigerate, and add_toppings, remained the same. Sorry for changing my mind every three seconds. But as they say: change is the only constant in life (and software development). To be honest, we will need to change the list at least one more time: pumpkin cheesecake will be available from September. It’s WORLD FAMOUS! Without a doubt, we need to add it to the list once September arrives. Oops, that means we need to remove it from the list when the holiday season passes. It’s obvious that my cheesecake list changes often. There is a design principle: encapsulate what varies. We should give it a try. The CheesecakeFactory is a simple class. All it does is create and return the correct cheesecake based on a given type. With the help of CheesecakeFactory, the make_cheesecake method becomes much simpler. The make_cheesecake method can now focus on the actual steps that go into making a cheesecake without having to worry about different cheesecake types. Our CheesecakeFactory is an example of using the Simple Factory. Simple Factory is used for encapsulating object creation. Besides Simple Factory, there are two other members of the Factory Pattern family: Factory Method and Abstract Factory. We won’t go into the details of these two patterns. In a nutshell, Factory Method and Abstract Factory use inheritance. Factory Method is about creating one type of object, and Abstract Factory is about creating a family of different types of objects. All three of them are about encapsulating object creation by using the design principle: encapsulate what varies. Pulling the logic of creating the correct cheesecake based on a given type is a small move that gives us lots of benefits. The biggest benefit is that we can modify the cheesecake list without touching the make_cheesecake method and its test. All we need to do is update the CheesecakeFactory class and leave make_cheesecake and its test alone. We want to separate the parts that vary often from the stable parts. Because each time we modify a part of our code, we might introduce bugs. The parts that vary are the fragile parts of our system. We want to keep the stable parts away from the fragile parts. So if we did introduce bugs when updating a part of the system, it would be easier for us to locate the bug. I need to run to get a cheesecake now.

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/understanding-the-template-method-design-pattern-by-eating-at-chipotle-37f6e029f065?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Life— gain an intuitive understanding of OO design patterns by linking them with real-life examples. Template Method is a commonly used design pattern in programming and real life. Before we dive into details of the pattern, let’s learn an important life lesson: There are four steps involved: For example, my go-to order is Bowl + Steak + (Tomato + Corn) + Guacamole and my friend Amber’s go-to order is Burrito + Chicken + (Green Chili + Red Chili) + (Chips + Soda). If we code our go-to orders in Ruby, they will look like: When we order, we put everything we want into the vessel and return the stuffed vessel. Unfortunately, Amber and I decided to go on a diet for a while. And we decided that when we ordered from Chipotle, we could only get tomato as a topping and no extras. So our choices are limited to: During the diet, our go-to orders have to be modified to: Putting our orders down in Ruby, we have the following: Since both our orders have the exact same toppings, extras, and order methods, it makes sense to pull them out as a parent class, DietOrder, and have DietOrderSihui and DietOrderAmber inherit from it. Now our friend Ben wants to join our Chipotle Diet Club, and he likes Tacos with Carnitas. Then his order will be: Ta-da, you just learned the Template Method design pattern! 🎉 🎉 🎉 Don’t believe me? Take a look at the definition of the Template Method: Doesn’t this sound exactly like what we just did with our DietOrder and SihuiDietOrder/AmberDietOrder/BenDietOrder? DietOrder defines the order skeleton: one can only get tomato as a topping and no extras & drinks, and one orders by picking a vessel and putting everything inside the chosen vessel. SihuiDietOrder/AmberDietOrder/BenDietOrder redefine the vessel and meat depending on our personal preferences. Let’s say a month passed by, and Amber and I followed our diet strictly. We decided to reward ourselves with cheat days! On a cheat day, we have soda as our drinks. 🍺🍺🍺 And each of us can decide which day of the month will be our cheat day. Since Ben is new to the club, he decides to stick to the diet strictly for a bit longer. Let’s see how it looks in Ruby: In DietOrder, we ask if today is a cheat day. If so, we can have Soda as an extra. Otherwise, there are no extras. And by default, today is not a cheat day. Amber and I get to define our own cheat days: Since Ben is sticking with the diet strictly, he doesn’t get a cheat day. His class doesn’t need to change. The is_cheat_day? method is a hook. A hook provides a way for a subclass to implement an optional part of an algorithm. If the subclass doesn’t care about the part, it can skip it and use the default implementation in the parent class. In our case, is_cheat_day? is optional. SihuiDietOrder and AmberDietOrder implement it because we want to have a cheat day each month. But Ben does not want to have a cheat day. So BenDietOrder skips implementing is_cheat_day? and uses the default one from DietOrder, which always returns false. There are two important object-oriented design principles used in the Template Method: 1. Encapsulate what varies. In our case, the varying parts are vessel, meat, and is_cheat_day?. We encapsulate them in subclasses. For the parts that don’t vary, toppings and extras, we leave them in the parent class. 2. The Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you. Yes, The Hollywood Principle is a real thing. In Hollywood, movie producers will tell actors: “Don’t call us, we’ll call you if we find a role that fits you.” In programming, low-level components can participate in the computation, like AmberDietOrder defining its own is_cheat_day?, but the high-level components control when and how, like DietOrder calls is_cheat_day? within extras. One definition => Two Design Principles => Or… you can just take away a Chipotle order 🥙 🌮 🌯 Next time, we take our design & food adventure to 🍰🍰🍰 "

They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access.

We’ll be using an AI generator that barely anyone ever talks about it. And I’m pretty sure this story is going to leave your jaws dropped. Now, most of the side hustles I share are very simple, in terms of the structure and steps you need to follow. If you can use the tips I share to focus on a specific keyword in a smaller market, you’ll make money for sure. How many of us are fashionistas or love a good fabric pattern? Well what if I told you it was possible to start out your own fashion line with almost no effort. Yeah, I’m serious. And no, I’m not writing this story just for the fashionistas, there’s room for everyone with this side hustle. The best part is that I’ll be sharing highly popular online platforms, where you can sell these patterns to generate a steady stream of passive income. Now remember, the images we’re talking about are patterns So, we’ll be generating these patterns to sell online using AI art generatorsm And for this, allow me to introduce Creative Fabrica Spark. First, we need the ideas or niches. Simply head over to ChatGPT and ask for pattern ideas that can be generated with AI. Now, these are quite broad niche ideas, so let’s narrow them down a bit. Ask ChatGPT to give you 10–20 sub niches for your favorite category. Now that we have the ideas we need, let’s head over to Creative Fabrica Spark. So Creative Fabrica Spark is a suite of AI tools but we’re particularly interested in its pattern generator. So once you choose the pattern generator, it’s time to start generating. You can copy-paste this simple prompt & replace it with your specific idea to generate the pattern of your choice. Now, Here’s the pattern I generated with Creative Fabrica Spark using this same prompt. I don’t know about you but this pattern is pretty amazing. Now, With the ideas from ChatGPT and a tool like creative Fabrica Spark, you’ll be able to generate endless images and patterns to sell online. This has to be the most important part of this story, so pay attention. You guys loved Zazzle the last time I talked about it. So here’s another idea for you. At least this time, AI is doing almost everything for you. Now, Zazzle gets over 24.2 million visitors per month. On Zazzle, you just need to upload a digital copy of your pattern on products like Zazzle will then handle the entire shipping costs and customer service while you make passive income. Creating a Zazzle shop is free, and I found a seller who was making a pretty sustainable income of over $7,000 per month. This is another lesser known print on demand website, which means less competition and more sales for you. Don’t be deceived, Society 6 gets over 3.3 Million visitors every month and works just like Zazzle. Moreso, I found a seller who made $7,091 selling patterns on Society 6. Sounds familiar right? Creative Fabrica, Creative Fabrica Spark! Yeah, they’re the same website. So you can basically create and sell patterns on the same marketplace.

But that’s dead wrong… Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to respond to them in a healthy way. For example: Of course, it’s hard work to cultivate a healthier relationship with your emotions — one that allows you to be resilient and strong in the face of painful feelings instead of fragile. But it is possible. And the most effective way to do it is to build consistent habits that promote a more tolerant and accepting relationship with all your feelings — even the painful ones. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to cultivate these 4 habits. Like anything painful, our automatic response to difficult emotions is to try and control them — usually in an attempt to escape them or “fix” them. And this tendency to control makes sense given how good at exerting control we are in most areas of life: In many areas of our life, it’s helpful and productive to exert control over our problems. But here’s the thing… Emotions aren’t under our direct control. Go ahead and try it: Of course, these are ridiculous experiments to run because you don’t have a happiness dial you can just adjust at will. Or an anxiety button you can just turn on and off. You can only control your emotions indirectly, primarily through how you choose to think and what you choose to pay attention to. For example: When you try to control things you don’t have control over — like your feelings — you’ll only create more pain and suffering for yourself in the long run. Emotionally strong people take control over their attention and what they choose to focus on. Instead of letting their mind bounce around according to the whims of instinct, they practice holding their attention on what matters and avoid getting sucked into unhelpful thought patterns like rumination or worry. If you want to be more emotionally strong, validate your emotions and control your attention. Most people associate emotional strength with toughness and being hard on themselves. This makes sense because as children this is what most of us learned: That if you wanted to be strong — a strong student, a strong athlete, a strong musician — you had to be strict and hard on yourself in order to achieve. Unfortunately, this toughness approach doesn’t work real well with difficult emotions. And in fact, the harder you are on yourself for feeling bad, the worse you’ll end up feeling. For example: Here’s the bigger point: When you respond to painful emotions with negative self-talk, you train your brain to be ashamed of feeling bad. Emotionally strong people realize that it’s actually much more helpful to be compassionate and understanding with yourself when you feel bad. In other words, they practice compassionate self-talk. Now, if that sounds a little woo-woo or new-agey, it’s not at all. Self-compassion simply means applying the same standard of kindness and support that you would give to a friend who was struggling to yourself. For example: True emotional strength comes from gentleness, not criticism. Emotionally strong people listen to their emotions but never take orders from them. Unfortunately, our cultural attitude toward emotions tends to be one of extremes… Most people see emotions either as silly and to be ignored or gotten rid of or that they are quasi-mystical experiences guiding us toward truth and ultimate enlightenment. In reality, emotions are much more mundane. They’re a survival mechanism that adapted over hundreds of thousands of years. And while they’re quite useful in some situations, they’re just as often unhelpful in others. For example: The point is simply this: Your emotions will lead you astray just as often as they will guide you. Emotionally strong people know that in the face of difficult decisions, it’s best to listen to their emotions. But ultimately, they use their values and reason to guide their decisions, not the emotional whims of the moment. Think about it: Listen to all your emotions but don’t blindly take orders from them. Emotionally strong people are able to resist the pull of unhelpful emotions because they’ve spent time discovering and clarifying their values. As a result, they’re able to make decisions that are good for them in the long-term rather than just impulsively acting on whatever feels easy in the moment. It’s hard to set and enforce healthy boundaries… But it’s even harder to live without good boundaries… Emotionally strong people know that you can’t be emotionally healthy if you never stand up for yourself and your own wants and needs. Unfortunately, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries is a classic short-term/long-term problem: Like eating a healthy diet, studying in school, or investing your money instead of spending it wastefully, what feels easy in the short-term doesn’t usually lead to great results in the long run. And what feels difficult in the short term often leads to much better outcomes in the end. So too with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries… But here’s the thing… Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Saying no to an overbearing manager or manipulative family member feels bad in the moment. But don’t mistake the fact that it feels bad for whether it’s a good decision or not. If you want to become more emotionally strong, practice communicating your wants and needs assertively and having the courage to set (and enforce) healthy boundaries. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to build these 5 habits: Each week, I send out a newsletter with simple, practical tips for building emotional strength and resilience.

I still haven’t showered from my morning trail run. I’m wearing my stay-at-home mom uniform — over-sized Marine Corps sweats, tshirt, Crocs flip flops, ponytail. I feel safe in this uniform. It doesn’t hug any part of my body, allowing me to hide my physical failures. In this uniform I can pretend I’m acceptable, tolerable. It says I did something today, I tried. This look combined with toilets I scrubbed until they shine sends the message “I’m not a lazy pig, I’m valuable. Please keep me.” This uniform is enough to make up for my lack of lipstick and style. It walks the line between disgusting and acceptable. So far, it’s been enough that my husband is still willing to initiate sex with me once a month. The kind of sex you have because you need to feel worthy. The kind that lets him know you need him. Unfulfilling but purposeful. It’s dinner time, so I’m busy in the kitchen slicing tomatoes and onions on the cutting board that I was instructed was to be used exclusively with the very expensive Shun knives I received as a Christmas present. He comes in from the deck with a plate of hot burgers. My gut said something was off. I pursued because I’m the pursuer. I went to him, hugged him, stepped back, my hands still on his shoulders, looked in his eyes and said “Is everything okay? Are we okay?” I know the answer. I always know the answer. I just didn’t know what it would be this time. Is this one forgivable? Can I patch it up again? It’s like a tire with a slow leak. You fill it with air and when it lasts longer than you expect, you just keep driving on it. But eventually the tire goes flat and you’re no longer able to get the car to the repair shop. This — us — cannot get to a place of fixing. “I told myself I’d tell you if you asked.” No. No. Please, no. “There’s this woman from my past… We reconnected during our family trip to San Diego… I thought she’d brush me off again… We started talking… She makes me feel alive.” I could feel the panic consume my body. I hate this place. It feels so shameful. I know I’ll do anything. I always do anything. "

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

Kosovo then was under Serbian rule, in the midst of a civil war. Erion is part of the Albanian community in Kosovo — the majority in Kosovo but a minority within the wider Serbia. In the 1990s, the Albanians in Kosovo were being persecuted by the Serbian government: losing their jobs, facing educational restrictions and more. Throughout the 1990s there were skirmishes between the ethnic groups. But the situation escalated into a war in 1998 when the Serbian government decided to send their army into Kosovo, creating a full-scale conflict.Erion’s father was a doctor. During the war, he went around to different villages stricken by war to help the people there. Because of this, the Serbian military put him on their wanted list.On April 1, Fushe Kosova was surrounded by Serbian forces. Erion (still just a baby), two siblings and his mother had left town beforehand. But his father and the rest of the family were still at. The exact details remain unknown, but during the coming days, Serbian soldiers came to the Krasniqi house and killed five members of Erion’s family, including his father.By the end of 1999, NATO intervened in the conflict and gave Kosovo special status under the UN. In 2008, Kosovo got independence, with an Albanian majority and a small Serbian minority. Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s independence, and there are still many tensions between ethnic Albanians and ethnic Serbs.From childhood, Erion thought constantly about the war. He and other Albanian children were taught to hate and fear Serbs. As a teenager, the fear moved completely towards hate and extremist thoughts towards Serbs — even though he had no interaction with the actual Serb minority. He became seriously violent towards others in his hometown (fellow Albanians), all based on the dream of getting revenge on Serbs.Towards the end of high school, Erion started to hear stories from his grandparents about the time before the war — when Albanians and Serbians got along. That was a wake-up call to start to see how much harm he was doing to himself and others by living a violent lifestyle and being filled with hate.In the three years after Erion gave up violence, he still had no interactions with actual Serbs. But in 2019, Erion randomly found a training with a Kosovo organization named Local Peace, in partnership with the Youth Peace Ambassadors Network. He signed up not to meet Serbs — he just wanted to have fun and experience something new. But when he met Serbs for the first time and felt all the fear of being in a Serbian-majority city, made me realized how they might feel living in areas surrounded by Albanians. He started to realize that the picture he held in his mind of Serbians wasn’t actually true — it was all based on assumptions. Meeting them, and hearing their experiences and opinions helped him realize that both sides suffered during the war. He saw a documentary about young Serbians and Albanians, filmed directly before and directly after the war — and some of the participants filmed before the war were missing afterward because they’d been killed.Erion realized how one-sided stories can be, and how easy it can be to overlook the experiences of the other side. Hearing the stories from the Serbian participants and what happened to their families made him want to investigate the crimes from the war, published by neutral media. This let him realize the real scale of destruction caused by the war. Today Erion wants to run workshops that will create safe spaces for young Albanians and Serbs from Kosovo to meet without fear, learn together and share their experiences. For him, the most important thing is to educate young people about how destructive the war really was for all sides and to try to make them communicate and share the pain with one another. This will allow the people of Kosovo to move towards a better future, where the war is remembered but is not repeated.

The 21st September is the International Peace Day, established in 1981 by the United Nations resolution to commemorate and strengthen the ideals of peace both within and among all nations and peoples. Youth Peace Ambassadors Network, as young peacebuilders and human rights activists, strives for building a culture of peace– through local activities, international projects, and every day conversations. But how so? We believe that we can inspire others (and each others!) and also get inspired by you with the actions of the committed and passionate young peacebuilders around the world. To do so, for the International Peace Day 2017 we celebrate it by launching a project “Peacebuilders Stories” — collection of stories by young peacebuilders that may serve as an inspiration to develop culture of peace. Through interviews, we will share some insights of the life and actions of the young people working for peace, their inspirations and motivations. Let`s meet Karen (based in Greece), Nienke (based in the Netherlands) and Emil (based in Bosnia and Herzegovina) and read their peacebuilders` stories. Karen Pong is an educator in human rights education, peace education, conflict transformation, gender issues, human trafficking/people smuggling and children’s rights. Karen is a founding member of the Youth Peace Ambassadors Network (YPAN) and began her work in the youth field in 2007. She is also involved in work of Trafficked Victims Unit and Generation 2.0 for Rights, Equality and Dignity. Check the tool to help young people and educators to confront, dismantle and replace hateful narratives — try the “We can!” publication of the Council of Europe. Nienke Verhoeks is 29, she is a Youth Peace Ambassador and work with unaccompanied minors who are likely to be send back to their home country at an asylum seeker centre in the Netherlands. Her goal is to bring a smile on their faces everyday, hoping that it makes them forget their situation. Together with MasterPeace she is setting up projects to find out what their talents are. Because no matter how hopeless your situation is, we all have talents. Emil Balavac was born in Mostar in 1989, but grew up in Jablanica where he lives also today. Emil is a Youth Peace Ambassador and works in Youth club „Under the Same Sun“ in Jablanica as a program manager. He cooperated with the Commission for coordination of Youth issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, National Youth Council of Serbia and in numerous organizations including UNDP, OSCE, Jablanica Municipality, Election Commission of Jablanica, Institute for Youth Development, Anna Lindh Foundation in B&H and many others. Emil completed series of activities dedicated to youth issues,development of youth related policies on local, regional and international level. We are looking for more stories to be shared and told.

I still haven’t showered from my morning trail run. I’m wearing my stay-at-home mom uniform — over-sized Marine Corps sweats, tshirt, Crocs flip flops, ponytail. I feel safe in this uniform. It doesn’t hug any part of my body, allowing me to hide my physical failures. In this uniform I can pretend I’m acceptable, tolerable. It says I did something today, I tried. This look combined with toilets I scrubbed until they shine sends the message “I’m not a lazy pig, I’m valuable. Please keep me.” This uniform is enough to make up for my lack of lipstick and style. It walks the line between disgusting and acceptable. So far, it’s been enough that my husband is still willing to initiate sex with me once a month. The kind of sex you have because you need to feel worthy. The kind that lets him know you need him. Unfulfilling but purposeful. It’s dinner time, so I’m busy in the kitchen slicing tomatoes and onions on the cutting board that I was instructed was to be used exclusively with the very expensive Shun knives I received as a Christmas present. He comes in from the deck with a plate of hot burgers. My gut said something was off. I pursued because I’m the pursuer. I went to him, hugged him, stepped back, my hands still on his shoulders, looked in his eyes and said “Is everything okay? Are we okay?” I know the answer. I always know the answer. I just didn’t know what it would be this time. Is this one forgivable? Can I patch it up again? It’s like a tire with a slow leak. You fill it with air and when it lasts longer than you expect, you just keep driving on it. But eventually the tire goes flat and you’re no longer able to get the car to the repair shop. This — us — cannot get to a place of fixing. “I told myself I’d tell you if you asked.” No. No. Please, no. “There’s this woman from my past… We reconnected during our family trip to San Diego… I thought she’d brush me off again… We started talking… She makes me feel alive.” I could feel the panic consume my body. I hate this place. It feels so shameful. I know I’ll do anything. I always do anything. "

I started writing this on October 7th, and I’ve been writing it ever since. Even though this awful war is not about you (Western, mainly White leftists), I’ve been finding myself having full conversations with you in my head. I tried to tell myself it doesn’t matter what you think, to focus on myself, on the people impacted, on what I believe in. But here I am, spending my energy on you. Because I’m surrounded by you and it overwhelms me. This might not be worded perfectly, I might ramble or not make sense. We’re on day 19 of hell, so we do what we can. This is not the most urgent thing to talk about right now, I know that. As I write this, there are still over 200 people held hostage by Hamas, civilians, mothers, babies, elderly. There are thousands dead in Gaza, hundreds of funerals in Israel and so many bodies still not identified. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing so quickly. Like I said, day 19 of hell. 19 straight days of the most horrific accounts, pictures, and videos I’ve ever seen, that I truly wish I could unsee and un-know. The images of babies in Gaza buried under rubble, of babies in Israel burnt alive, of old women taken hostage, of mothers trying to protect their families with their own bodies. I feel these images rattling inside me, all sharp edges, leaving their marks. I can’t look at a child without being reminded. I can’t look at my own grandma without being reminded. This is all we can think about. So it bears repeating: release the hostages, declare a ceasefire, help the survivors, start working towards a real, long term solution. Even though we have so many awful, urgent things happening all around us, I’m still writing this now. Writing is how I make sense of things and I need to make sense of the difficult feelings so many of us on the Israeli left have been experiencing in the last two weeks. These awful two weeks that feel like one long awful day. I’m writing this out of immense pain and grief, from my own perspective as an anti-occupation Israeli, to try and explain a bit what this has been like for me, for us. I want to note that this is not for those of you who celebrated what happened on October 7th. If you felt any joy in your heart about hundreds of civilians getting slaughtered in their beds, about children getting executed in front of their parents, about grandparents sacrificing themselves to save their grandkids, about horrors that I can’t even handle describing— I truly have nothing to say to you. Whatever is wrong with you is too deep and I want nothing to do with it until you figure that out. This is for those of you who know that what happened is, at the very least, sad. For those who treated this absolute nightmare as an unfortunate situation that we had coming. For those who didn’t celebrate but instead stayed silent. Who were so quick to lecture us about context and resistance from the comfort of your homes. Those who were so eager to share hot takes calling us losers who don’t understand decolonization while terrorists were still hunting down survivors to finish the job. While we were still searching through snuff videos of the massacre Hamas posted online, looking for signs of life or death from loved ones. Those who had the posts locked and loaded, ready to show us just how progressive and radical you are. This is for you. What really shocked me is how quick you were to know what’s right. On that awful Saturday, while little kids were still hiding in closets and under beds next to their parents’ dead bodies, before we even started counting our dead, you already knew what’s right. You already told us. You, who never faced such horrors and who couldn’t even imagine them, who never felt or will feel such real, immediate fear for your family and your people, you were ready with your posts telling us about privilege and the price of revolutions. And I can’t stop asking myself where you got the nerve. How you dared to sit comfortably in your home and casually post your little tweets and memes about how acceptable it is to slaughter us, in between your posts about brunch and your dog and your friend’s birthday? How dare you lecture us on how we should have reacted? What kind of subversive activism do you think you’re a part of when you’re being so careful not to express any understanding towards our grief? What do you think you’re fighting for? Sometimes I think some of us on the left have become so focused on pointing out what we perceive as subversive, as not obvious, that we fail to see the most simple and obvious of things. That we’ve gotten so used to this oppositional standpoint that we find ourselves so far removed from the values that are supposed to be at our core. Values of humanity, solidarity, justice, peace. How did we find ourselves condoning (if by silence, omission, doubt, or something worse) the cold blooded, planned, systematic murder of children, women, entire families? I don’t know exactly where we took a wrong turn but I’m praying we find our way back. There is obviously the personal hurt here. We’re going through unimaginable amounts of grief, and even in the worst of it, you couldn’t spare us a hint of kindness. You were so committed to finding and aligning yourself with the party line that you couldn’t show us an inch of humanity. So careful not to commit the awful sin of supporting the evil colonizers, of humanizing the enemy, of normalizing our existence. So careful that you could not allow yourself to acknowledge our pain, even if you’ve known us for years. So yes, there is personal hurt. A lot of it. It’s really hard having your friends turn on you, chastise you, doubt you, or just completely ignore you when you’re going through the worst nightmare you could imagine. You’ve compounded our grief, and taken away from your own humanity by doing so. That is for you to figure out now. There is also a bigger hurt here. The damage we could see you making to what activists in the region have been working towards for so long. On October 7th you were gleefully explaining justice to us, but we on the Israeli left already knew what awaited us and the people of Gaza. We knew hell was about to be unleashed on them and that nothing inspiring, revolutionary, or progressive was about to happen. We knew that Palestinian civilians were about to pay for what Hamas did, and that so much more grief was just around the corner. While you lectured us about decolonization, we were already grieving the children of Gaza. You played right into the hands of the most right-wing, fascist Israeli voices. Those who have been telling us that no one cares about our lives, that Palestinians would slaughter us like animals if given the chance, that our friends on the left would celebrate it. That our activism and anti-occupation work will not save us. You have made it so incredibly hard for us to explain that this is not what we’re fighting for. That this isn’t what Palestinians want for us. That this is not a price anyone should ever ever have to pay. Palestinians directly affected by this showed us grace during this awful time, knowing that our fates are tied together, while you chose to tell us that this is just how the cookie crumbles. You, who did not witness the horrors that we’re trying to stop, closed your hearts to us quicker than many of our Palestinian friends, who were the ones actually experiencing them. People who lost so much have shown more humanity to the “other side” than you even dared to entertain. What excuse do you have? We didn’t ask you to wave an Israeli flag. We didn’t ask you to say this is just as bad as what’s happened in Gaza. We just asked you for basic human sympathy, we asked you to say this is unacceptable. We asked you to let us grieve and to grieve with us, just as we will continue to grieve with the people of Gaza. It shouldn’t be this hard for you. It cannot be this hard for you. Yes, we know you think this is a narrative that gets enough attention. That politicians and the media have already condemned it and you don’t want to join them in their “we stand with Israel” parade. We know you think it’s been repeated so much it doesn’t even matter anymore. But you know what — it matters to us, and we’re going to need to hear it from you. You are supposed to be the ones who care about justice, our allies in this fight, not the media and the politicians. If this is the vision you have for liberation then we never have been and never will be allies. I’m at a loss at what some of you think Israeli anti-occupation activists should do. Is the right thing to accept any act of violence as legitimate, as long as it’s done in the name of decolonization? Is it for us to get down on our knees with our hands up and let ourselves be raped and murdered for freedom? Is it to let our families be slaughtered and say nothing other than “any act of resistance against an oppressor is legitimate”? Maybe you will be kind enough to allow us to grieve. Obviously quietly, privately, lest we push the wrong narrative. Or maybe we just need to go back to where we came from? To truly decolonize all of Palestine? Should we go back to Poland, to Iraq, Germany, Russia, Yemen, or would you like to host us at your place? The Zionist project is not something I ever celebrated, but you need to understand that unlike many of your colonial ancestors, we did not come to Palestine out of some imperial dream. We didn’t come to conquer or even to find a better life. We came as refugees. As survivors of pogroms and the Farhud and forced displacement and yes, the Holocaust. We know, we’ve said many times, the Holocaust wasn’t the Palestinians’ fault. It doesn’t justify the occupation or excuse any of the atrocities committed by the Israeli government. But it does provide that thing you crave— context. It does mean that we have nowhere else to go. It means that Israelis and Palestinians will continue to live and die together on this small piece of land. This is it for us. I know you’re tired of hearing about the Holocaust. It’s ancient history. An excuse we cynically use to justify everything the Israeli government does. You think we have to let it go, because we’re not those same poor sad Jews anymore, now we’re the bad guys, with our strong army that protects us from everything (well). But sometimes I remember that Anne Frank was born 6 months after my grandma. My 94-year-old grandma, who still tries to make it in time to the bomb shelter at her assisted living facility, every time there’s a siren (she fails most of the time, she moves rather slowly). This is the context we’re working with, the fear that’s burnt into our DNA by centuries of persecution. A fear that, despite knowing our history, I never felt quite as strongly as I did on October 7th. A fear I tried to push aside because I believe it takes courage, trust, and faith to work towards real peace instead of towards war. It takes believing your allies and those you seek to make peace with can see your humanity. This is that fascist talking point — we need to be able to defend ourselves, at all costs. Pity will not help us, being moral will not help us, we need to survive. If our lives are fair game in this thing you so happily called resistance, decolonization, freedom, then where the hell does that leave us? If you won’t speak up for even the most vulnerable and innocent of us, our babies and our elderly, then what choice do you leave Israelis with any sense of self preservation other than to continue to live by our sword? Other than understanding that our lives are worthless to the world, with no one but ourselves to count on? Israeli activists have been advocating for decades that our future, our safety, our freedom, is tied with that of the Palestinians. That it’s not a zero sum game — it’s the opposite. That we live together or die together. That it’s not us against them — it’s war mongers and corrupt politicians against the rest of us. Against the people. Us killing and hating each other won’t make us safer or better off. It only bolsters our most power-hungry leaders. We’re trying to maintain our humanity in the face of the most brutal and cruel attack on our people since the Holocaust. In the face of horrors so awful that I have to actively push them out of my mind because I know I will buckle under their weight. We’re trying to remind ourselves and each other that all life is sacred, that our freedoms aren’t mutually exclusive, that, quite simply, killing innocent people is wrong. We shouldn’t have to remind you as well. Israeli anti-Zionist activists have been working endlessly, side by side with Palestinians, against the occupation. Some of us have dedicated our lives to it, all of us have paid a price for it. You are a guest in this struggle and your position on it has cost you nothing. You have sacrificed nothing. You can do it comfortably and without consequence, and the result of it will not impact your life or safety. Israel and Palestine could both disappear off the face of the earth in a cloud of blood and smoke, and your life will remain almost unchanged. You might lose a couple of friends, post about it on Instagram for a week or so, and have some awkward office conversation. Then your life will go on. But our lives and those of our families and communities depend on the consequences of this struggle. We don’t expect praise or thanks for our work against the occupation and we truly don’t do any of this for you, but we do expect basic human empathy. Yes, we know Palestinians don’t get basic human empathy from so many people, we know they’re not heard. This is what we’re fighting for. But we will not erase ourselves and our families in the process, because, like I’ve said, all of us maintaining our humanity in this struggle is simply not negotiable. We definitely won’t negotiate it with you. Your aspirations of decolonization are theories. They’re something you would never have to face yourself. You’ll never be the collateral damage in this kind of freedom fighting, you’ll never have to pay a price for it. Your family will never be slaughtered at the altar of anti-colonialism, yet you’re willing to sacrifice our families. You’ll never be told to leave your home and go back to wherever you came from (even though you were born there). Your history of colonialism is old enough, your history of genocide effective enough, that you and your family and everyone you love can continue to be safe and comfortable while you preach about armed resistance. I’m sure you wouldn’t dare criticize any violent act of decolonization acted upon you, but we’ll never truly know. I wouldn’t wish it upon you that we’ll ever find out. My heart breaks over and over as I see us trying to garner a shred of empathy from you. As we wave the pictures of our dead, the nightmarish stories of our survivors (that you were so quick to doubt and disregard), the horror videos of torture and murder that we will never be able to forget. As we plead and beg for you to care about the 200 people held hostage. We disrespect ourselves and our dead in this desperate attempt to shake you, to make you believe us. People in Israel and Palestine are being pitted against each other with our suffering. Forced to fight to show you the greatest horrors, the most death, the worst cruelty. Trying to win this made-up competition which only has losers. Each trying to scream at those on the other side who closed their hearts and minds to us: why can’t you see us? How could you justify this? Don’t you see we don’t deserve this? So we will swallow the pain you’ve caused us. Because, again, this isn’t about you. We’re not going to let you antagonize us from our own fight for justice. You won’t make us choose between our life and safety and the life and safety of the people in Gaza, or anywhere else in Israel or Palestine. We know that peace and justice are possible, we will be safe, and Palestinians will be safe. We will find a way, together. We have no other choice. Lastly, I want to share the ending of the poem Red Sea by Aurora Levins Morales. I’ve been finding myself repeating it in my head like a mantra. I recommend it. And a final tiny note: to the friends and allies who have managed to maintain their humanity and hold the complexity and the absolute horror of this situation with us — we cannot thank you enough.

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

But that’s dead wrong… Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to respond to them in a healthy way. For example: Of course, it’s hard work to cultivate a healthier relationship with your emotions — one that allows you to be resilient and strong in the face of painful feelings instead of fragile. But it is possible. And the most effective way to do it is to build consistent habits that promote a more tolerant and accepting relationship with all your feelings — even the painful ones. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to cultivate these 4 habits. Like anything painful, our automatic response to difficult emotions is to try and control them — usually in an attempt to escape them or “fix” them. And this tendency to control makes sense given how good at exerting control we are in most areas of life: In many areas of our life, it’s helpful and productive to exert control over our problems. But here’s the thing… Emotions aren’t under our direct control. Go ahead and try it: Of course, these are ridiculous experiments to run because you don’t have a happiness dial you can just adjust at will. Or an anxiety button you can just turn on and off. You can only control your emotions indirectly, primarily through how you choose to think and what you choose to pay attention to. For example: When you try to control things you don’t have control over — like your feelings — you’ll only create more pain and suffering for yourself in the long run. Emotionally strong people take control over their attention and what they choose to focus on. Instead of letting their mind bounce around according to the whims of instinct, they practice holding their attention on what matters and avoid getting sucked into unhelpful thought patterns like rumination or worry. If you want to be more emotionally strong, validate your emotions and control your attention. Most people associate emotional strength with toughness and being hard on themselves. This makes sense because as children this is what most of us learned: That if you wanted to be strong — a strong student, a strong athlete, a strong musician — you had to be strict and hard on yourself in order to achieve. Unfortunately, this toughness approach doesn’t work real well with difficult emotions. And in fact, the harder you are on yourself for feeling bad, the worse you’ll end up feeling. For example: Here’s the bigger point: When you respond to painful emotions with negative self-talk, you train your brain to be ashamed of feeling bad. Emotionally strong people realize that it’s actually much more helpful to be compassionate and understanding with yourself when you feel bad. In other words, they practice compassionate self-talk. Now, if that sounds a little woo-woo or new-agey, it’s not at all. Self-compassion simply means applying the same standard of kindness and support that you would give to a friend who was struggling to yourself. For example: True emotional strength comes from gentleness, not criticism. Emotionally strong people listen to their emotions but never take orders from them. Unfortunately, our cultural attitude toward emotions tends to be one of extremes… Most people see emotions either as silly and to be ignored or gotten rid of or that they are quasi-mystical experiences guiding us toward truth and ultimate enlightenment. In reality, emotions are much more mundane. They’re a survival mechanism that adapted over hundreds of thousands of years. And while they’re quite useful in some situations, they’re just as often unhelpful in others. For example: The point is simply this: Your emotions will lead you astray just as often as they will guide you. Emotionally strong people know that in the face of difficult decisions, it’s best to listen to their emotions. But ultimately, they use their values and reason to guide their decisions, not the emotional whims of the moment. Think about it: Listen to all your emotions but don’t blindly take orders from them. Emotionally strong people are able to resist the pull of unhelpful emotions because they’ve spent time discovering and clarifying their values. As a result, they’re able to make decisions that are good for them in the long-term rather than just impulsively acting on whatever feels easy in the moment. It’s hard to set and enforce healthy boundaries… But it’s even harder to live without good boundaries… Emotionally strong people know that you can’t be emotionally healthy if you never stand up for yourself and your own wants and needs. Unfortunately, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries is a classic short-term/long-term problem: Like eating a healthy diet, studying in school, or investing your money instead of spending it wastefully, what feels easy in the short-term doesn’t usually lead to great results in the long run. And what feels difficult in the short term often leads to much better outcomes in the end. So too with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries… But here’s the thing… Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Saying no to an overbearing manager or manipulative family member feels bad in the moment. But don’t mistake the fact that it feels bad for whether it’s a good decision or not. If you want to become more emotionally strong, practice communicating your wants and needs assertively and having the courage to set (and enforce) healthy boundaries. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to build these 5 habits: Each week, I send out a newsletter with simple, practical tips for building emotional strength and resilience.

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

One week after eliminating the last two social media platforms left standing in my world — Facebook and LinkedIn — I have said so long to my Spotify Premium subscription. I have a feeling I will miss it about as much as I miss Netflix, which I got rid of this past January. So hooray for me. I’m not sure what it was that finally made me push it over the edge of the cliff. I wasn’t dissatisfied with their service, which I assured them of in their exit questionnaire. After, all the music I could ever want was at my fingertips. It wasn’t the latest dollar per month increase either, I had weathered those before and I think by now we all realize it’s just par for the course with these things. It wasn’t that I was overwhelmed by the business model, which requires — like all other social media and subscription based apps — that I buy into the illusion of endlessness of content, such that even if I give 24 hours a day to it, I could never possibly get to the end of it. It wasn’t because I had finally come to my senses and taken a stand over the way they pay artists for plays on the platform. I was interested in the inequity that it involved up to a point, but not really being able to do anything about it, eventually just sort of shrugged my shoulders over it. It wasn’t even that I really had stopped using it, in the past half a year either. I think the whole operation works on the same premise as gym memberships: 20% of customers use it a lot, 60% use it enough and 20% forget they have it and continue to pay for it each month. That last group is the sweet spot with things like this. No, it simply has to do with the fact that Spotify is not the way I want to listen to music anymore. My legion of readers will know that at the start of the year, I made the switch back to buying and collecting vinyl and it has been an unmitigated pleasure. "
https://medium.com/@rahul_rathan/why-we-are-in-debt-to-music-and-musicians-3ac992d1de63?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"One of the most therapeutic medicines ever devised in the history of mankind is Music. In almost every culture there has ever been, Music has been a major part. It is displayed as a hallmark of evolution of characteristics of human emotions. We all were introduced to it in our adolescence by our mothers in the form of a lullaby, the humbling part of it is that its not necessarily the words of a song that make us feel more serene. As a baby, we do not understand whats being said but the sound, rhythm and tune has made all the effect there is, showing us that we all are tonal creatures long before we are creatures of understanding. But as we grow up, we grasp the significance of the words of course but there remains a sensory level which cuts through and effects us far more than any argument or idea ever could. The musician can, at points, trump anything the philosopher might tell us. When we feel anxious or upset, people around us try to comfort us by pointing to facts and ideas, they try to influence our thinking and via careful arguments — to quieten our distress. But the most effective way to deal with problem is to play us some good music. We might need to be quietened and made mild by a Coldplay, an Adele or something by AR Rahman, before we are in any position to listen to reason. Music is the greatest mood adjuster we have ever invented. Music can reunite us with the feelings we need but we lost touch with. It reconciles us to a sadness within, which we had to be too brave and stoic not to feel. It is the axe that breaks the frozen sea within us. Music can lend dignity to our sorrows, framing and containing what might otherwise be unmanageable grief. Music is there for us like a comforting parent in the moments of despair. Music returns to life, gently nudging us to return to the side of generosity and hope. We can follow the music’s trenches of confidence, when our own will is in a slump. Music is there to take us beyond the everyday, to transcend the ordinary and survey ourselves from the emotional repertoire. Music reconnects us with our instinctual, bodily selves when reason, logic and discipline are in danger of crushing us. Music breaks down the barrier between the strangers urging us to see what we have in common, rather than what divides us. We fully discover our debt to music and musicians when we can acknowledge how powerless we sometimes are to change our moods through reason alone. “A good life doesn’t only need a library of ideas and books, it requires a vast and ever changing playlist that can systematically tug us back to our more hopeful, sensitive and resilient selves” So, whats your playlist that you hold back to when you are in a state of distress where reason can’t get you out of it?

https://medium.com/@rahul_rathan/should-you-give-up-on-having-crushes-ea3717a7b6eb?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"They happen all the time. Isn’t it? In school, college, at your work, near by grocery store and now a days online, pretty much every where, especially in the privacy of our minds. The dynamic is always the same. Very little knowledge, indeed complete ignorance combined with a deep sense of knowing them absolutely and of being entirely certain they would, if only circumstances allowed, be the one. Its been going on since early adolescence, this madness. And even now when one should know better, it happens. These crushes, show off our capacity for knowing how to make most of the smallest details like a smile, a picture of her beautiful face, a casual text from her. They instantly become whole people with whom we can imagine years of life together, full of profound mutual understanding, empathy, tenderness and laughter. This bless of a person will, we know, understand us and all the secret, complex ignored parts of us. This capacity we have for elaborating a whole personality from a few details, its there when we see exquisite paintings or art in any form, not that we understand the nuances of it completely but its a beautiful thing we feel we understand at once, dwelling in our own perspectives and finding happiness in them. Cynics (and sometimes even your crush, when you express your feelings towards them) say, its madness, this filling in of the gaps. We’re just projecting wild reckless fantasies, but that’s too sweeping. We’re probably right to be delighted. It’s just not the whole story. Perhaps the beautiful person in whom you are seeking your own happiness might be someone who is skeptical, alternative, intelligent, humorous. But the error of the crush is to go beyond that insight, to think this possibly could ever be the whole truth about a human being. Knocked off course by the crush’s power, we forget one central inviolable fact of the human nature. That everyone is crazy and troubled to be around. Everyone has something substantially wrong with them. Everyone is extremely hard to live with. You can’t know everything from the smile or the beautiful eyes but it’ll be something. Time will reveal it sure enough, because life has messed up all of us, because we all grew inadequately parented and have all ended up terrified and anxious pretty much all the time. And most of the time it leads us to thinking that we should That said, should we actually give up on having crushes? I think, we shouldn’t. We just shouldn’t believe in what they appear to promise anymore. Of course we have’t glimpsed complete perfection yet. Looking back from future, it will just be a small beautiful chapter in a large compendium. So, keep crushing! ;) "
https://medium.com/@hunt5280/why-you-should-wake-up-at-5-00am-6e09a8b06c24?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"I have seen an outbreak of YouTube videos, blog posts, articles, books, etc. talking about why everyone should wake up at 5:00AM everyday. While looking through my YouTube subscription feed one night back in mid-October I stumbled across a new Casey Neistat video — “Navy Seal Commander explains why wake up at 4am”. Just like that, 11 minutes later I had my alarm set for 5:00AM the next morning. I’m always up to try new challenges and adapt new positive habits so why not? The video made me excited to try this challenge. I was finding I didn’t have enough time to do all the things I wanted to do within a day, let alone create and work on things I’m passionate about; so why not try this out? The first week was tough, I’ll admit it. There were some mornings I didn’t get out of bed until 5:30, 6:00, or hit snooze too many times. Although, the mornings I did get myself out of bed at 5:00AM I noticed that these were some of my most productive days. The long term benefits are worth it though — I was finding I was getting a lot more work done on my personal projects and goals, I had time to learn new skills, and I was getting to the gym nearly everyday. I was committed to make this my routine. Of course, as a 20-year old university student this challenge takes discipline — which is why so few people would ever attempt and stick to something like this. It is now January 24th, 2019 as I write this. I have been getting up at 5:00AM most mornings (except Christmas Break) since mid-October. I’ll admit it, some nights are hard to fall asleep at 10:00PM when your apartment with 4 other guys has paper thin walls. A good pair of noise-cancelling headphones almost always saves the day. The past few weeks since getting back on my routine after the holidays the 5:00AM wake-ups have been painless and almost natural. As expected, it doesn’t always feel so great to wake up at 5:00AM. I will admit though; it feels pretty great when you’ve already done 3 hours of work and been to the gym while the rest of your roommates are just waking up. One trick I’ve adapted to ensure I get up is putting my phone out of reach of my bed, so I have to get out of bed to shutoff the blaring alarm in the morning. It sounds terrible but this way I’m not inclined to go on my phone in bed in the morning or hit snooze. Another technique I’ve adapted is not checking my phone in the morning, and I’ve also deleted Instagram off my phone. I have learned to love the mornings. It’s silent, I like drinking coffee, and I can get a ton of undisturbed work done. When you get up at this time the days feel unbelievably long and this is a feeling that really doesn’t change. I’m awake. What do I do now? Personally, I like to make coffee and sit down on my computer and work on personal projects or online courses. Over the past 5 months I have been committed to learning iOS app development, UI/UX, music production and recently HTML & CSS. I have an app launching on the App Store in a couple months and I enjoy spending my time learning all these new skills and have discovered some new passions along the way. Since I can get so much done within the day I can spend a couple hours every night reading — something I never felt like I had time to do. I would recommend waking up at this time to work on things that are important to you, and you’ll also realize how much time you actually have in a day to make progress on your personal goals and dreams. You will be amazed at how much of an impact having those extra morning hours everyday make on your life. People might think you’re crazy — but it’s usually the ones that aren’t willing to adapt or try these beneficial habits for themselves. I can’t imagine not waking up at 5:00AM now. It has become one of my favourite habits and I even find myself now waking up a few minutes before my alarm. I have recommended it multiple times to my family and friends but almost everyone is unwilling to try it! If you want to start — jump right into it, but have a plan for what you want to use the extra time to accomplish and make sure you plan out what you want to do as soon as you get out of bed as this will keep you motivated.

https://medium.com/@hunt5280/day-trading-cryptocurrency-a35e9edf3390?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"The cryptocurrency market is insanely volatile. Is it still worth getting into? WARNING: THIS IS NOT A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL ADVICE. From an outside perspective the cryptocurrency market seems like somewhat of a good idea if you look at what others have done and the potential earnings you can make. Although, it’s not as simple as you think. I have been trading cryptocurrency on-and-off for over a year, and I was part of that massive spike that peaked in December 2017. I cashed out on a few investments and made some money, but while being a young 19 year old I decided I would ‘HODL’ (Hold On For Dear Life) to some of my assets in the market. Not a great idea — but I learned a lot. I didn’t lose a lot of money but I will say it was about 70% of my initial investment. I didn’t let it discourage me or scare me away from ever investing again, but I did take a little break from the cryptocurrency world. As of recently I decided I would slowly ease back into the cryptocurrency world — recently adding an additional $1000 to my portfolio. This money will be used to ‘day trade’ on the USDT/USD market, which is one of strategies I previously used to make some good returns. USDT is available on a lot of the big trading platforms and is essentially a stable cryptocurrency that is apparently ‘backed by real US dollars’. I’m not sure how much I believe of this but I’ve never had an issue with it, and it’s a good way to trade a variety of alt-coins while quickly being able to retreat to a stable currency if things go poorly. I personally use Bittrex to trade as they have decently low fees, and a good selection of currencies. My goal to start is to make about $10-$20 per day, and put these profits aside. I will also be using a stop-loss on all my trades as a precaution if things start to go badly, since the crypto market is known to do things like this. This is about 1–2% return on my money — which is a good place to start with investing a small amount like this. The thing with the cryptocurrency market is that you can get lucky, but also greedy. There may be some days when you make a really good trade and make a lot of money, and others where things go complete opposite. The potential is big though, for example a coin I was watching today called ‘WAVES’ has spiked 22% over the past day and a half. I didn’t invest unfortunately, but theres opportunities popping up like this all the time within the cryptocurrency market. Here is a screenshot of the rise of the WAVES currency. If you invested $1000 at a price of $2.50 per coin, and sold at the top of this cycle at $3.15 then you could have made $260. Not bad for a few hours on the internet. Of course, this is a lucky scenario — but it shows that returns and trades like this are possible. Now I’m not saying you should go throw a bunch of money into the market, but I do think it is a fun hobby to get into. The technology behind blockchain and cryptocurrency is very interesting and if you’re interested in a new skill or experience then this may be something fun to experiment with! "
https://medium.com/@hunt5280/i-attempted-the-24-hour-dopamine-fast-i-lasted-18-hours-42deba90cbb5?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"The title says it all. I lasted 18 hours, not 24 hours; so what happened? First off, the rules for the challenge were simple: I was only allowed to: Sounds pretty easy right? Well yes, kind of. I decided to start the challenge at 8:00PM and carry over until 8:00PM the next day. I started the challenge thinking the hardest part was going to be not eating — but it turns out that wasn’t exactly true. That night from 8:00–10:00PM I didn’t do anything I just walked around my small student room, laid down and eventually wrote a few ideas and thoughts down on paper. I ended up falling asleep at around 10:15PM — not worried about the next day because I had nothing to do. I was happy to catch up on sleep since I had been getting up everyday at 5:00AM for the last 4 months. That morning I ended up waking up very early, I didn’t check the time but it was probably earlier than 5:00AM. I then went back to sleep and cycled through about 6 different dream states until I finally decided to get out of bed to do essentially nothing. I checked the time it was 10:45AM. Awesome, I only have 9 hours 15 minutes left of this! What the fuck do I do now? I made my bed, brushed my teeth, drank some water and then sat down and opened my notebook. I started thinking and writing about things in my life that I was excited for and things I needed to work on. I filled about 6 pages with thoughts, ideas, issues, goals, dreams and sketches from my mind. I look at the clock, its only 12:30PM. This is when things got tough. I felt like I had just gotten out all the thoughts in my mind and it was now empty. I started getting hungry, I realized I had a headache from not having coffee, I wanted to read and I wanted to listen to music. At that moment I decided that I’ll cut the challenge short and end it at 2:00PM — 18 hours, thats good enough right? I leave the apartment at 1:45 heading directly towards Starbucks, I still hadn’t turned my phone back on and I left it behind — which is something I rarely do. I was in a pretty great mood though, I ended up getting my coffee upgraded to a Venti for free, and instead of walking into Starbucks with my mobile order and instantly leaving, I was just present in the moment, in no rush. I realized how big of an issue mobile phone use is for people my age. As soon as we feel uncomfortable or bored in any situation we instantly go on our phone — hop on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook or iMessage and distract ourselves from the present moment. As I was waiting 5 minutes for my coffee I even had a few urges to pull out my phone, almost like a natural habit. So next time you’re going to get food, waiting in line, or going somewhere — just leave your phone behind, you really don’t need it and you’ll realize how much extra time you have. I will definitely be attempting the full 24 hours again in the future — and I recommend anyone to try it and modify it to their schedule. Also, unless your an Instagram influencer or marketer, stop using Instagram and you will easily gain an hour of your day back — or more, and use this time to work on creating things that you are passionate about. I have learned to appreciate how many sources of dopamine we get in a day, and how these feelings shape our day. From now on I will be taking 30 minutes to an hour a day to cut out all electronics and focus on writing ideas and thoughts, and I encourage everyone to do the same. "

https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-atlas-prime-pay-solana-network-fees-in-atlas-85472d5803d6?source=collection_home---------2----------------------------,"In-game currency ATLAS is now a base currency on Solana with ecosystem-wide adoption potential, allowing Star Atlas players to use it for paying network transaction fees and rent instead of SOL Star Atlas has created another game changer on Solana, enabling ecosystem users to pay their Solana transaction fees directly in ATLAS. The technological solution is called ATLAS Protocol for Real-time In-game Microtransaction Ecosystem (PRIME), powering direct ATLAS payments. It is also available to third parties, including community developers, wallets and infrastructure builders. Atlas PRIME simplifies the lives of its users who from now on require holding only one utility token: ATLAS. It enables the establishment of true simultaneous play-and-earn and replaces the need for signing every transaction with Solana through exclusive use of ATLAS, e.g. for movement and crafting in Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE) game modules. Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., said: “Atlas PRIME adds another key pillar to the long-term sustainability and self-sovereignty of the circular Star Atlas economy. This additional ATLAS token utility is another step in bringing power to the people, and enables the onboarding of the worldwide player base.” With Atlas PRIME, users retain full control over their actions. Atlas PRIME is being released as a pre-enabled facultative feature, and can be turned on or off by the user. The first Star Atlas feature to include Atlas PRIME functionality is the upcoming SAGE Labs game module. Atlas PRIME also makes it possible for Unreal Engine 5 game players to only use one currency, ATLAS, significantly lowering friction and removing a major game adoption barrier. All Star Atlas products and services are slated for future implementation of the direct ATLAS payment functionality, and will receive it upon the update of a given product’s Star Atlas Account program. How it Works When users pay transaction fees in ATLAS, Atlas PRIME covers the SOL on their behalf. ATLAS is not converting directly at market rate, but is tied to it. There is a fee associated with the ATLAS-SOL exchange rate, which is set by ATMTA and represents a source of revenue for the studio. The initial exchange rate fee is 115% ATLAS for 100% of a SOL equivalent amount. The 15% margin is determined based on significant risk associated with holding volatility currencies, including a liquidity risk for ATLAS, and covering the infrastructure costs for the service. Rates may change in the future. For developers to be able to use Atlas PRIME in their third party app, they will need the bindings and the endpoint information, available at build.staratlas.com. In future Atlas PRIME feature expansions, users can look forward to more functionality, including enabling auto-sign on wallets, allowing for multiple simultaneous levels of security for their assets and various wallet actions. This will allow users to safely play the game with a game session hot wallet protected through a security configuration via Star Atlas Accounts.

https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-starpath-buddy-link-referral-program-revolutionary-web3-discount-1586fcb8a021?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"Starting on September 20th, Starpath, the first truly web3 recruitment system, brings a generous 10% referral discount for new users, and gives referrers a 25% share of revenue from primary sales as well as secondary sale fees. Star Atlas has partnered with Buddy Link to power its next-gen Starpath reward program with a revolutionary product that facilitates on-chain referrals in Star Atlas for any user on Solana. It is the first-ever solution to enable on-chain referrals, ensuring transparency, security, and trust within the referral process. The Starpath program rewards users for their contributions, sharing the success of Star Atlas with the entire worldwide community. This mutually beneficial relationship rewards those helping build the ecosystem, incentivizing user participation and project growth. The high reward system creates a web3 ecosystem that thrives not only on excellence in design and technology but also on the strength of the community that supports it. The scalable reward program also gives the many private organizations and creators within Star Atlas another way of supporting and expanding their operations. This groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates with Star Atlas on-chain programs, making it simple to deliver new users instant benefits with an individually tailored gaming experience, as well providing the Starpath program participants with transparent revenue sharing. Starpath users reap the benefits of successfully promoting Star Atlas whenever the recipients of their referrals complete a primary or secondary (peer-to-peer) purchase in the Galactic Marketplace. The referrer is rewarded 25% of the net price amount in primary sales and 25% of the ATMTA share of the fee in secondary sales. The reward per each referred user stays at this level for 12 months following that user’s first purchase, followed by a 5% sales share during the duration of the Starpath program. The referred users receive 10% off primary sales in the Marketplace, usable for 90 days. Users can sign up for the reward program via a link in their Player profile at Play.StarAtlas.com. Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., said: “Starpath, powered by Buddy Link, shows the Star Atlas commitment to excellence and to continuously raising the bar for the entire gaming industry, as well as paving the best way for the web3 ecosystem. It is the very first program in the world that allows Star Atlas to reward its players and ecosystem users, providing another way of giving power to the people. He added: “Receiving a 25 percent share of purchases and our marketplace fee acts to empower the dreamers, creators and builders worldwide who want to participate in the creation of an open and decentralized world.” Aidan Neil, Co-founder of Buddy Link, commented: “As two pioneers of fully on-chain solutions, Buddy Link and Star Atlas share a common vision and value set of building a better, more community-focused web3 world. This forms our strong partnership, united in creating the best experiences for a connected and engaged web3-empowered society.” He continued: “The Buddy SDK, imbued with Star Atlas know-how, integrates quickly and easily in the metaverse ecosystem. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface that encourages users to explore, share, and learn about web3 projects, promoting growth and collaboration within the web3 community.” The Starpath program first went live in July 2022, and is now being powered by Buddy Link. Users of the legacy system are eligible to receive rewards proportional to their past success directly from Star Atlas and need to connect with Buddy Link via their player profile to participate in the new Buddy system. The New Starpath at a Glance Users sign up for Starpath at Play.StarAtlas.com, where a referral link is generated in their Player Profile. A link in their profile also leads to the Buddy Link platform for monitoring referral activity. A user who generates a link can no longer be referred but keeps any existing referral benefits of their own. Referral codes are randomly generated. When a new user clicks on a referral link, they become linked to the original referrer, with any purchases counting as going to that referrer. Any subsequent referral links they click do not change the linked referrer. If the user clears their browser cache before making a first purchase, the referral source resets. Referred users will see badges with discount on primary sales directly in the Galactic Marketplace. Upon making a first purchase with their wallet, a referred user is permanently locked to the referrer. When a user makes a purchase with a referral link, they automatically generate a link for giving out as a potential referral discount of their own. New Starpath rewards can be claimed on the Buddy Link platform leading from the player profile at StarAtlas.com. The reward structure has a maturation curve that incentivizes early user action. For the referrer, the 25% commission on primary sales will last for 12 months and then decrease to 5% for the rest of the duration of the Starpath program. This incentive is per referee, not account wide. So every new referral starts a new 12 month timer for that referee’s purchases. The 10% discount for the referred user will expire after 90 days. For participating users, Buddy Link will apply a special promotional platform fee of 0% for 90 days, and a low fee of 3% from then onward. For the duration of the Golden Ticket event in SAGE Labs, every $500 USDC equivalent of value transacted will also award the referrer 1 Golden Ticket to enter in the $1.5 million promotion.

https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-3rd-generation-ship-configuration-system-9c067d2e681?source=collection_home---------4----------------------------,"The new system accompanies the next series of game modules including soon to be released SAGE Labs space strategy economic loop. Ship configuration consists of all of the modifiable and static parts that make up each unique ship. These basics are outlined in the Star Atlas Lore Wiki. As the game systems continue evolving in lockstep with in-game utility, the way ship configurations work since the early GAO Phase 1 era has evolved significantly. Throughout this whole time, we have iterated and improved the breadth and depth of underlying rule sets and schema for populating a ship’s loadout. The first major upgrade came with the second generation, Ship Config V2, which saw significant changes to crew, components, and modules. Crew stations and interior elements were also introduced. In releasing the V2 update, we received a lot of feedback from the community, most notable of which was: Regarding point 1, ship configurations have already been adjusted to match ship descriptions in the latest Galactic Marketplace patch. For example, if a description mentioned an oversized weapon, the ship does in fact sport an oversized hardpoint. Other tweaks were made to remove mentions of oversized components and instead mention higher quality components. This segues nicely into the next point. Regarding point 2, the entire component variance table is being removed. This means all components filling core component slots (but not weapon slots) will be the same class (eg. XX-Small, X-Small, Small, Medium, etc.) as the ship. However, ships will still be able to slot components of varying tiers from Tier 0 to Tier 5. Higher tier components will consume more power, generate more heat, but also have significant performance enhancements. Another important note is that most of the manufacturer bonuses apply to the component itself now. This means a component with a high manufacturer point value is applied to the ship it is slotted in. If a Pearce warp drive is slotted in a Busan ship, that Busan ship enjoys the Pearce Warp drive bonus. To further make things interesting, there will also be matching bonuses for components matching the ship manufacturer. The details of that system are work in progress, but the intent is to create a significant amount of options and complexity for build crafting. Regarding point 3, which is origination pricing and V2 ship stat configs, we are granting buffs to certain ships that were worse off than their intra-class counterparts. These buffs for select ships will come in the form of upgraded components. The following Table outlines the component point upgrades that each respective ship will receive in order to match its V2 performance with its origination price. Only ships on this list will receive a boost to their component tiers, otherwise, they receive all tier 1 components (and tier 2 for any oversized core components) — unless marked (a) or (b) for an exception. Ship-specific particularities: As an example, the Opal JetJet was relatively more expensive than a similarly performant ship like the Pearce X5 (excluding manufacturer bonus). This warranted 16 component upgrades. To apply the upgrades, we took the following into consideration: 2. Prioritized components affecting SAGE Labs stats: 3. All remaining points were spread across all the core components evenly. The component upgrades will be reflected in the SAGE Labs stats in the initial release as well as honored pending the snapshot. Snapshot date has not been announced and will be made public in the future. Although the fundamental ship pricing algorithm has not changed since V2 ship configs have been released, the price of ships will be much more uniform within a single ship class. This is simply due to the nature of V2 configs. The method is straightforward: For example, suppose a ship has a baseline price of 2000 ATLAS and it gets a 10% manufacturer premium. This ship (and all other ships of its size and manufacturer) would receive a price of 2200 ATLAS origination price. When a new ship configuration update goes live, components can be removed from ships. This will leave behind a Tier 0 component in the ship that cannot be removed or sold. This means ships will always be flight ready. Tier 0 can easily be replaced with higher quality components of the correct type and class. Also, after the snapshot and airdrop for crew, components, and modules, any future ship will only be for the base hull with Tier 0 core components. Any weapons, crew, modules, or core component upgrades will need to be acquired separately. The table below lists the core component tiers that will be granted to each ship pending the snapshot. Core components range from Tier 0 to Tier 5. See the updates soon on labs.staratlas.com.

https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-star-labs-first-ever-web3-space-economy-simulation-game-solana-p2e-gamers-d417b5a24483?source=collection_home---------5----------------------------,"SAGE Labs is an early access browser-based open-world game with real-time gameplay, total freedom of action and a life-like economy where players can gather, craft, trade and prosper, all entirely on Solana. In another world-first by Star Atlas, SAGE Labs is a gameplay release that strengthens the game ecosystem’s leadership position in the web3 industry, and opens up the Star Atlas economy to a worldwide audience. SAGE Labs offers a rich economic loop for play-to-earn (P2E) players and web3 gaming enthusiasts in search of immersive, fun and engaging gaming experiences that capture their in-game time and effort as tangible value. This is possible through the use of fully secure, truly player-owned and controlled Star Atlas assets. SAGE Labs features the most advanced technology stack in a blockchain-enabled web3 game, with the entire game logic and game state stored on the blockchain. The release expands integration with other Star Atlas features and with the wider Solana ecosystem, including by enabling new web3 features in the StarPath referral program, which now offers a 10% referral discount to new players and an additional 25% purchase value share for the referrers. Soon to be released live on Solana Mainnet, the fully on-chain gameplay with ultimate freedom of action sets this title apart from other web3 games. The completely decentralized, first-of-a-kind economic game module also enables any developer to use its programs and infrastructure to build new tools and even gameplay solutions. SAGE Labs is a simulation of a real-life economic system featuring advanced gameplay mechanics, focusing on deep space resource extraction and crafting. In order to create a fully closed loop in this rollout phase, the release is accompanied by an unprecedented $1.5 million Golden Ticket promotion. With a 2D interface designed for economic participation, SAGE Labs is playable in any Solana-enabled web browser. Heavily anticipated by the worldwide Star Atlas community, SAGE Labs fully integrates in the Star Atlas ecosystem. The game activates the assets that players own and can purchase on the Galactic Marketplace, bringing large-scale utility to the in-game currency ATLAS and its circular economy. Players can also use items from the game interchangeably with other current and future gameplay features. SAGE Labs gets its name from Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE), a full-feature Star Atlas browser game in the making. Originally developed and used as an econometric game development tool, it showcases two dimensional real-life economic gameplay. This release will enable players to get familiar with the game mechanics of SAGE as well as improve future releases. SAGE Labs is a precursor to an upcoming SAGE release titled SAGE: Starbased, which is poised to become the biggest fully on-chain browser game in blockchain history. Starbased will launch with complete 3D graphics, an expanded immersive gameplay and will feature around 20 fully on-chain complex Solana programs forming a real-life economic loop. In the current release, SAGE Labs has limited UI and features a reduced number of gameplay loops. The $1.5 million dollar loot table with Golden Tickets stands in place of the closed loop economy with starbase crafting, upgrading, and destruction, which players will be able to experience in SAGE: Starbased. SAGE Labs is also the successor to SAGE: Escape Velocity, the record-breaking on-chain space movement gameplay feature, which became the blockchain game with the highest total transaction volume ever with over 80 million transactions. Read more about Escape Velocity here. SAGE Labs brings new core game logic and enhanced building blocks of all current and future gameplay features, including a new decentralized character management system and an ATLAS transaction fee payment system. The game features fleet management with individual ship stats, a resource extraction and freighting loop, a crafting loop, a data runner loop, a redemption loop in the form of ships, CSS Plots, and Golden Tickets, ATLAS sinks and additional utility. All game assets are on-chain, with dozens of new ones being introduced to the marketplace. With the game running on the Solana Mainnet, players will be able to use their spaceships and other in-game assets in real time. In SAGE Labs, players use text-based menus to perform resources-consuming actions, and a 2D map to navigate across the vast space of 51 star systems featured in this release. Notably, players can perform and discontinue any action in real time. Due to the full integration with the entire Star Atlas ecosystem, players can use items in the game interchangeably in the Galactic Marketplace, in Faction Fleet, Faction Claims and in future versions of SAGE. Players start their galactic expansion from a faction Central Space Station located in the starting zone of their chosen Star Atlas faction (MUD, ONI or Ustur). They move on to faction Starbases in other star systems as they start exploring deeper space. At these structures, they are able to gather fleets of spaceships, with which they can venture further into space to scan for valuable data (SDUs) and resources, extract them and use them for crafting. Players’ success in this economy loop will depend mainly on the composition of their fleet — ships each having a unique set of characteristics and stats, some of which have a distinct advantage in the mining, crafting and extraction economy loop. Exploration — All 51 star systems or Sectors are available for exploration and scanning by player fleets and located in both starting and medium risk zones. Fleets can scan to retrieve Survey Data Units (SDUs), which is a component for crafting Golden Tickets and which can also be exchanged for loot rewards. Fleet movement across the map in all directions consumes a varying degree of resources — fuel, food and ammo, which any fleet carries in finite amounts. If a fleet runs out of resources, players need to pay an ATLAS fee to be able to respawn it at a Starbase, while any loot or resources carried by that fleet will be lost. Extraction — Players can then extract resources by mining asteroids within asteroid belts and fields found in various star systems. The farther players venture from their faction’s Central Space Station, the more rare and higher quality resources they are able to find. There is a limited selection of 9 different raw resources available in SAGE Labs. Mining consumes two of three basic ship resources — food and ammo. Crafting — Players are able to craft at either a Central Space Station or a Starbase. While crafting speed depends on the number of ship crew assigned to a task, the players will be able to craft an assortment of items and further crafting components for more advanced crafting recipes. The crafting loop consists of creating materials, producing components from them and assembling them into increasingly more complex and valuable items. The much anticipated Golden Ticket event is the culmination of the SAGE Labs economy loop. The campaign is split into 2 parts. The first is a redemption program where players can amass a large number of the crafted assets and turn them in for a limited list of Star Atlas’ ships, claim stakes, or Central Space Station (CSS) land NFTs — the pool totalling $300,000 USDC in VWAP. While most players will not be able to single handedly go out and craft one of these massive assets, it provides a vibrant labor market for players to participate in. These redemptions will notably require Survey Data Units in addition to crafted assets as inputs. The second part is a massive, weekly drawing worth $150,000 USDC in VWAP per week for 8 weeks, a total of $1.2 million in VWAP. In addition to the Star Atlas redemption assets mentioned in the section above, players will be able to craft a very rare item called a Golden Ticket. This is a player-owned blockchain asset that requires every single craftable item in the game to create. While it is a complex recipe, players with Golden Tickets may choose to put them towards the weekly draw where their chances of claiming a prize from the drawing are proportional to the number of tickets they have put forth.

https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-metagravity-bring-30000-concurrent-players-metaverse-game-a8af390a967b?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"In a joint vision to truly revolutionize gaming, MetaGravity will enable Star Atlas to scale from 5,000 to beyond 30,000 simultaneous players in a single game environment, creating a true metaverse experience. Star Atlas and MetaGravity are making their partnership for revolutionizing the gaming industry’s standards known to the world. Equipped with groundbreaking MetaGravity technology, Star Atlas aims to debut the world’s first super-massive gaming size with a record number of concurrent players, AI non-player characters (NPCs) and interactive objects within a single shared persistent environment. This pioneering functionality is set to become a permanent feature of the Star Atlas game in Unreal Engine 5 following a future game update on the Epic Game Store. This is a first-of-a-kind partnership for the industry at large, with the collaboration between the teams of network engineers and Unreal developers already netting the first milestone, a successful 5,000-player stress test in a persistent, single non-instanced environment using advanced interactive bots, shown at the Solana PlayGG Game Festival in San Diego. For the past decade, the gaming development sector has grappled with the constraint of limited scale in game engine simulations, with traditional systems struggling to support more than a hundred current players. Despite many attempts by both tech giants and start-ups alike, this problem remained unsolved — until now. The new technology brings a dramatic scaling up of the concurrent player ceiling within Star Atlas to beyond 30,000 co-players and beyond, more than was previously ever possible in a video game. The partnership is on track to achieve an unlimited total capacity of concurrent users, with the number being expected to grow together with player demand. Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, said: Leveraging MetaGravity’s advantages, the Star Atlas metaverse experience is geared to be free from limitations of scale, and it will enable a successful deployment of a massive public release. Rashid Mansoor, Founder and CEO of MetaGravity, commented: The MetaGravity platform is designed and built as an infinitely-scalable next-generation metaverse engine, which overcomes the limits of the current state-of-the-art spatial partitioning engines, including performance limitations, scale limitations and cost-prohibitiveness, helping Star Atlas raise the bar in game development. Star Atlas is a next-gen gaming metaverse emerging from the confluence of state-of-the-art blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video games, and decentralized financial technologies. Using Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite, real-time graphics technology allows for cinematic quality video game visuals. In addition, blockchain technology using the Solana protocol establishes a largely serverless and secured gameplay experience.

https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-chapter-begins-never-alone-mission-2-the-search-for-etira-is-now-alive-5b502d5ea642?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"The dark expanse of the cosmos enveloped the imposing MUD Central Space Station. From behind a viewport, a Punaab sat in contemplative silence, watching the flickering lights of the port far below. His solitude was punctuated only by the occasional distant hum of departing ships and the eerie whisper of the wind that carried through the heights of the sky. The rest of the world seemed tranquil, his space-traveling partner included, but Saand’s mind was as active as a Mierese astrobard’s tentacles, clashing with the serenity around him. Aware that sleep was an elusive entity, Saand sank into an armchair nestled in the corner of the room. He decided to channel his restless energy into something constructive. He activated the A.I. embedded within his wrist bracelet and began to narrate: “Dearest Diary, Yesterday, I found myself in a spectacle rarely seen: The legendary Wandering Caravan show. While the troupe is pretty mysterious by itself, its members wearing masks with strange numbers, what truly astounded me was the final act of the performance, themed ‘The Future.’ The initial acts, ‘The Past’ and ‘The Present,’ were already breathtaking displays of talent that left everyone in the audience stunned. Yet, the closing act was something entirely different. The skies above the Volant Station erupted in a vibrant blaze of orange lights, and before my very eyes, a dreamlike cinematic display passed like a movie. It was as though glimpses of what lay ahead were revealed to me — a tomb aglow with luminescent motifs, a colossal fleet raining destruction upon a hapless planet, a hidden temple buried within the depths, a punaab haunting my visions, a deep pool radiating a myriad of hues, and finally, utter darkness… Interestingly enough, my companion reported a very different experience, one of a crystalized planet with weird creatures. In fact, everyone seems to have had a unique, personalized encounter with the show, and the warnings of the Circus Master at the end were quite ominous as well…” Saand paused, his mind grappling with the potential meanings of the spectacle. Despite his best efforts, he could not crystallize a conclusive interpretation. He released a long sigh before re-engaging with his bracelet. “Regardless, there’s little sense in dwelling on trips woven by space entertainers! As a Punaab, I prefer to rely on reason and logic, anchoring myself to the concrete. And the undeniable fact is, my memories are gradually returning!” Saand rose from his chair, his smile reflecting the sense of accomplishment he felt. He had made significant progress over the months, journeying with his travel partner. He began to walk around the modest room, designed specially to cater to Punaabs. “We’ve weathered much in a short span of time, and yet, my past is gradually revealing itself. While the full narrative remains a mystery, it’s evident I was once a being of diverse talents and capabilities!” He paused, momentarily uncertain, pondering how best to articulate his peculiar circumstances. “It’s a strange sensation, A.I. My body reacts instinctively in perilous situations, sometimes even before I’m conscious of the threat. Before I even noticed, I was using Peli sticks against villains. The astonishing part is the seemingly infinite list of my inherent skills. Everything feels oddly familiar — mining, piloting, singing, dancing. Even the recognition of rare minerals and remote planets feels intuitive, as though I’ve experienced many adventures in the past. Who was this previous version of Saand? Whatever his identity, he was evidently a hard-working, curious individual, relentless in his quest for knowledge, crafting a temple from his own body. I owe it to him to honor this legacy.” The soft pitter-patter of rain against the viewport gently permeated the room. Saand approached the window, drinking in the tranquil views, a sudden wave of weariness washing over him. “Oh, before it slips my mind, my encounter with the Caravan did stir a dormant memory. It’s becoming increasingly clear that I am destined to meet the Punaab from my visions! If I piece together the fragments, I can almost see it clearly — “ A gasp broke his sentence. “Ah, yes, Etira… that’s the name etched on the tree in the park. It’s not merely a name, I think it’s a location, maybe as big as a planet. I’m supposed to meet her there and reveal some undisclosed truth. But what could it be?” Feeling the lure of his cozy bed, Saand surrendered to the inviting warmth and the soothing rhythm of the rain outside. As he allowed his eyes to finally close, he whispered: “Good night, A.I. Tomorrow, we embark on our second mission: The search for Etira.” Welcome to Never Alone, Mission 2, Captain! After two months of action-packed quests and adventures through Galia Expanse, You and Saand have finally found a decisive clue to the Punaab’s past, the existence of Etira! Although details still elude you, Saand had a date set over the mysterious planet, and now he must find his way into it. Nevertheless, the charismatic Punaab journey won’t be so easy because Etira hides outside of the gaze of the rest of the Galaxy — and the price for access is high. As our Punaab wanders across Galia looking for answers, let us discuss the transition to the next chapter of Never Alone, starting with the timeline: Considering the popularity of Never Alone, we have decided to extend the period in which players may acquire the mission one memories, allowing them to also participate in mission two and accrue all the memories necessary for the end-of-the-year prizes. If you have already completed the quests in Mission 1, don’t worry. All your NFTs will be dropped by July 19th, whereas the next mission, The Search For Etira, begins a day before on July 18th. This way, aside from following Saand’s story, you are also able to keep progressing in your Zealy quests by completing activities and obtaining the unique loot below, which is only available for those playing the Never Alone campaign! Make sure to keep in mind that you will need to choose how you are going to spend the memories you collected in your travels with Saand. So make sure to decide whether you are getting the mission one rewards or saving them for the end-of-the-year loot, as disclosed in the original Never Alone announcement article. The choice is yours. Saand’s story is far from over, and his destiny is entwined with yours, Captain. Make sure not to fail your Punaab companion, as destiny has great things reserved for the two of you.

https://medium.com/adamtemper/alien-rain-bcee458c21fa?source=collection_home---------0----------------------------,"It rained all day. I sat at the window with Jak longing for the sunshine of the previous six weeks to return. The roads, slick with mud from the tractor hurrying between the fields. Farmers desperate to move the livestock to shelter. It rained the next day as well. And all the following week. It was still raining the day we should have returned to school. It was the first time they had ever kept me home from school. It was a novelty, and I did not like it one bit. My mother and father were both at work. They left me alone in the house with Jak. He moped about, refusing to play or go out of doors. ‘Get out of the house,’ I shouted at him, ‘you’re driving me mad.’ He ignored me, sat on the floor in front of the television watching cartoons until he fell asleep. The rain continued all the next day and into the evening. I stared out of the window at our garden, which lay brown and soggy under its blanket of gray cloud cover. The wind blew through my hair as I leaned against the window frame looking down into our garden where Jak’s trampoline stood abandoned in its corner, deflated by rainwater lying in its hollow centre like a giant puddle waiting for someone to come along and jump into it once more before they went off to school. My eyes drifted away from the trampoline towards our chicken coop where two chickens pecked at each other’s feathers near their nesting box while another chicken perched atop their shed looking around for something else to peck at or chase or eat or whatever chickens do during their day-to-day existence… Beyond the front garden, we have a view over the rooftops of the neighboring houses and down to the ocean. There is an arched viaduct on the horizon. Six times a day, an old steam train puffs across, pulling carriages full of tourists who pay to appreciate my view. Summer in Janville for us kids is an idyllic mix of trips to the beach and ignoring our parents’ stress as they try to avoid the hordes of seasonal visitors clogging up the roads. We didn’t know that we would never see a summer like this again. The rain washed away all memories of that life. Little sailing boats in the distance braved the weather, their owners taking advantage of the unusual wind patterns to get a bit of adrenaline and relaxation before returning to their jobs in… "

It’s no fun to watch a protagonist who is not only doomed to fail, but is also doomed to never even try. I want to see characters who are willing to take risks and who have the ability and determination to make good things happen. I want stories that explore how we can turn our problems into opportunities, rather than stories that pretend that there are no problems in the first place. Solarpunk is a utopian vision for the future. It imagines a world where humanity has come together to save the planet, and uses technology to build a more sustainable, fair, and peaceful world. A world in which we have learnt from the past and built a future that is sustainable. A world in which we have learned to live with nature, rather than against it. We need to imagine a better future, because if we don’t, we will never achieve it. The good news is that the future is already here. We just need to wake up and start using it. Solarpunk is a reaction to the current dystopian state of affairs. Its proponents are not interested in giving up on humanity or the planet, but believe that we can create a better future by working together to solve our problems. But it’s more than just a visual aesthetic. Solarpunk is a politics, a way of life, and an ethos. For some, it’s a religion. And for others, it’s a movement, one that is growing as a push back following the end of the Trump presidency and the threat of climate change. Solarpunk is a politics, a way of life, and an ethos. Solarpunk is about more than just imagining what the world could look like if we were to live sustainably tomorrow. It’s about rethinking what the world could look like if we lived sustainably today. It’s about imagining new ways of living that are more fair, more sustainable, and more efficient. It’s about envisioning a world where technology is used to help humanity flourish rather than destroy it. It’s about creating a world that is more beautiful than the one we have now. "
https://medium.com/adamtemper/zen-doesnt-refuse-to-concede-e52b48320265?source=collection_home---------2----------------------------,"Zen rolls with life’s twists and turns and knows a positive outcome is always coming over the horizon. Be more like Zen. Life is a game. Death is the ultimate concession. Anything in between is just life’s next move. You may pick up the pieces and try again, but when it is your turn to go, you have no choice but to concede. In your last move, you can do no better than your best. You conceded to life, rather than life conceding to you. Zen does not feel sorry for himself. He does not complain, nor does he complain about others. Zen understands that some things just are what they are. When it is his time, Zen’s spirit leaves his body knowing that he did his best. Zen is happy. As Zen skates off the board, his objective is complete. He has played the game well. Like going in to serve and getting out, Zen considers his last thing to be his best thing. Zen has made a trillion dollars in life. Zen is rich. Zen looks at his life. Zen’s team did not win. Zen’s investments did not lead him to the promised land. Zen did not get the job he always dreamed of, nor did Zen buy the house of his dreams. Zen did not get the girl, and Zen did not get the dog. Yet Zen is not disappointed. Zen’s too cool to care. What does Zen mean? The word Zen literally means meditation or meditative wisdom. In Japanese. It is more than meditation. It is a philosophy. The philosophy is that through meditation, a person can realize enlightenment and understand the true nature of reality. Go with the flow and take what life gives you. Zen doesn’t mean you will not fight for what you want, but it should be done understanding that we cannot always get what we want. It is all part of life’s game of give and take. Zen is the bridge between the mind and the infinite expanse of consciousness. Zen is freedom. It is freedom from the bonds that bind you from experiencing total consciousness. When you are in line for the bathroom at the department store, Zen is the feeling that you are in the moment and you have nothing to worry about. Of course, if you are at the department store and you have to go to the bathroom, you are not Zen. You are not in the moment. Zen is not sitting on a mountain rocking back and forth chanting, Om… "
https://medium.com/adamtemper/quiet-people-definitely-have-a-lot-to-contribute-to-themselves-their-communities-their-company-9149b6dca516?source=collection_home---------3----------------------------,"“We’re having a brainstorm in 10 minutes… I’ll be asking on each one of you for your opinion.” My boss wrote over Slack. It was actually 85 minutes before the meeting even started, and then everyone spent an unproductive 20 minutes talking about their general fears and concerns of the issue. I’m always really nervous about voicing my opinion in these types of discussions, but I didn’t want to be accused of not contributing anything. My colleagues had already covered everything before it came to my turn to speak. I was both nervous and eager to talk. But overwhelmingly, I felt like efficiency was more important than just talking about things that we already knew and so was reluctant to say anything that would slow down the decision making. In the previous months, I received feedback from my boss, urging me to speak up more, contribute to discussions and have an opinion. I struggled with that. I’m introverted and before speaking, I think it over. Our executive team likes to speak first and distill down their thoughts afterwards. You might think to yourself, “How do you effectively lead a team, knowing that you lack the charismatic qualities that many executives have?” While introverts may feel less self-assured in this type of scenario, it is still possible to inspire trust and confidence. Introverts don’t want to speak in front of large groups, whereas extroverts are the opposite. This all means that introverts have a hard time being successful in most social situations with extroverted people. They enjoy staying at home or spending time one-on-one with someone. Research suggests that extroverts are more comfortable talking at length. In contrast, introverts prefer writing or drawing as self-expression. When we look at the top CEOs and executives out there, we think about those who can be confident and charming in a talkative setting. When people think about what a social butterfly is, they often think of someone who is a complete package in a room full of others. However, this term is commonly misused to describe introverts. Something that has only become valued recently is extroversion as a leadership trait. It began in the early 1900s and back then it didn’t matter as much what one’s public impression… "

As a precautionary measure, the US has extended its containment zone in the state of New York. The official decision comes after the death of two patients and twenty-one possible cases of infection near New York City. There is no cure for this virus yet, but scientists are optimistic that they will find one soon enough to prevent further outbreaks on Earth. The outbreak was first discovered by a British exobiology expert, Ralph Paterson, at the beginning of the year. Dr. Paterson, a veteran scientist from Edinburgh University, was visiting America in order to collect specimens of Martian flora and fauna for his laboratory in Scotland. While on his trek in New York State, Dr. Paterson came across two patients with symptoms of the virus, one of whom had died. The other patient was critically injured and later placed into quarantine shortly before he recovered. Traces of the virus were found on his body, as well as on a rock which he picked up from the ground. This dangerous disease is believed to have originated from Mars and has infected any living being that has come into contact with it. The symptoms presented by this disease are not yet well known, but signs that point to the disease include multiple skin lesions on the body of infected individuals as well as a high fever. We will follow this story closely and bring you daily updates. End of future article. "

A British sci-Fi and science writer working on a series of near-future novels. I also write non-fiction and I’m particularly interested in exploring the impact of emerging science (eg AI, quantum computing, human space settlement). You’ve stumbled on my ‘writing laboratory’. Congratulations. Here I share thought pieces, first drafts, and ideas for further development. If you find this sort of thing interesting, you are welcome to enter your email at AdamTemper.com and I’ll send you links to my new content (drafts and finished pieces — fiction and non-fiction) as it appears across the internet. This is the first iteration of the opening scenes of a new science fiction novel. It is set on an Earth-orbiting space station in the not too distant future. Please let me know your thoughts and reactions in the comments. Scarlett Francis paced up to the circular full-height window. Tomorrow was the day that her name went down in history. Planet Earth span below her. The station’s orbit was low, but not so low that the azure and rust curve of the African coast took up the entire view that her personal two-meter diameter window afforded. Over the horizon, the night was approaching, one of fifteen or sixteen sunsets that the station would see today. Under the station, for the moment, a golden day of the summer sun in the Earth’s northern hemisphere lay drowning deep in a lazy afternoon. The dazzling blue of Lake Victoria, which had glistened on the Earths most spectacular continent for 400,000 years, looked like a well that leads straight to the core of the planet, deep and full of secrets, fringed by the odd small cloud visible at this altitude, generated by the temperature gradient at the lakes shore. There would be people fishing out in tiny boats on that lake while overhead flocks of birds soaring in lazy circles. Raising her head a little from the blue of the lake and the thought of the afternoon, she could see the night coming; the blurred, shadowy edge of it sliding toward the unsuspecting afternoon, silent and uncaring. There is no stopping the inevitability, she thought, shivering, just once. The service station Fox had been her home for sixteen years now. Although Scarlett had grown used to life in low Earth orbit, she would… "

Writing may not be dieing out, but the importance of how we use it is. A world without writing is a world without subtlety, context and imagination. Without it, there is no poetry. No nuance. No reason to think about what you’ve written. No depth. All that’s left is advertising and sales. It becomes a shallow, endless loop. The purpose of a social media account becomes an attack on the human psyche, a battle for your attention, because when it comes down to it, the one thing social media accounts want more than your time is your money. Images are important; they’re a huge part of our lives. We use them to express ourselves, to express our emotions, and to give ourselves a community and a sense of belonging. They are art. But they’re not alone. They’re part of a balance that you can’t keep, if you put all your eggs in the image basket. Because ideas need words. Some things need to be explained, not kept hidden. Some things can’t be contained in the image. We fail, as users, to see language for more than what it is. Language is so much more than a series of words strung together to convey a series of ideas from one person to another. Even we, as writers, haven’t fully understood this. Language is at its most basic level, a system of symbols and sounds that allow us to talk about things. This is why we can use a word like ‘vampire’ to describe so many things. Anything that feeds on blood. Anything that stalks people. Anything that can be described as a monster. Pictures are important, yes, but words are invaluable because in the right hands, they… "
https://medium.com/adamtemper/whats-the-time-mr-wolf-f10c4cd1668?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"Time began at the Big Bang. When, and if, it will end is up for debate. Adam thought he had a good grasp on the basic concepts of time. Seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, decades, centuries, millennia. The blurring from the one into the other. The solar calendar, the leap years, the years that tick over so effectively and inevitably. He reckoned he was as good at time as anyone. Until the pangs started. Something was nagging at his consciousness, just beginning to boil in the back of his mind. It was a thought, or a feeling, some small fragment of memories, a sensation. That was the first stage. Then the anxiety set in. Then it began to grow into a gnawing dread. He had the vague sense that something was terribly wrong, horribly wrong, and that no-one else was aware of it. That he was the only one who knew. He was the only one who could do anything about it. Until he realised that no, he couldn’t. And that, in fact, it was all up to him. And then the panic. When Adam finally managed to pin it down, what he thought he was feeling, it hit him like a thunderbolt. He sat bolt upright in his bed, his mind made up instantly. He knew what he had to do, and he knew he was the only one who could do it. Two hands on hips, a swagger, a quick check of his pockets and he was ready. He marched full steam ahead with his plan, ready to confront the problem, to tackle the thing itself, whatever it was. He burst out of his apartment, down the corridor, ready to take on the world. Until he realised, abruptly, that he was going down the wrong staircase. He went to stop, stumbled at the top step, was heading straight for a tangle with the railings at the bottom of the stairs and could only watch in horror as events raced frighteningly towards him. He realised it was a problem not of his making. It was bigger than him, far bigger than him. A moment later, the moment that would have been his last, his history, his past, his legacy, his everything, was gone with a sickening crunch of metal on bone and a heavy thud of body on hard marble. Time had whizzed by without his notice for yet another moment. "
https://medium.com/adamtemper/science-fiction-is-the-hope-behind-the-curtain-of-the-present-4e25986a757b?source=collection_home---------9----------------------------,"Science Fiction says, ‘We can create the future, and here it is.’ Science Fiction is the hope that you might free yourself of the legal, social, economic, cultural, mental shackles that bind you. Science Fiction says, ‘you can stand up straight.’ Science Fiction speaks to the frustration, the boredom, the commonality of living in a capitalistic hell. It gives hope to the people who want to live their lives freely. It gives hope to the people who don’t want to live in a world where everyone is a product. It shows you that there is more to reality than what appears when you are sleeping. Well-written stories hint at the undercurrents beneath the world we are presented with. The themes of the stories talk about the commonalities of the world. The words and phrases and conversations that went on between the characters are the same conversations that are taking place all around us all the time. Science Fiction is the undercurrent that flows through the society we live in. It is the current that runs beneath the surface. It is the background music that plays in the back of your head even when you don’t notice it. Science Fiction is a warning to the present. Science Fiction stands against the tide. Science Fiction is a whisper in the wind that when captured and verbalised has the power to change the world, to change lives. Humans have always told stories. They’ve always told stories to make sense of the world around them. But as time moved on, the stories no longer bore a semblance to the reality of society. Instead of providing a viable solution to the present, present day Science Fiction gave rise to Science Fact. Science Fiction was no longer a warning to the present; Science Fiction is creeping into the present. Science Fiction is no longer a residue of the present; instead it is a blueprint of the future. Science Fiction doesn’t just depict the future; Science Fiction brings the future into present day. Science Fiction has always had the power to not only change the thought processes of the people who read it, but it has the power to bring about a change in the society that it comes from. Stories and novels used to preach morality and a form of right thinking. As society changed, so did the Science Fiction. Satire and humour gave rise to a Science Fiction that warned of the future. As time moved on, Science Fiction showed the future and stopped referring to it as a warning. The literature that once warned the present is now the present and is warning the past. Science Fiction villains are now gone. There is no need for an evil genius opposed by humanity. Science Fiction has moved past the time and need for a villain. Science Fiction and its technological progress are no longer the offspring of man. They have become one. Machines, the immovable objects that offer little to no hope, are as much Science Fiction as they are Science Fact. They are the reason we are heading towards a Science Fiction filled future, and a Science Fiction filled present. Science Fiction no longer needs to be perceived, for it is the reality we live in. "

This marks the start of our journey towards building an open marketplace for cloud resources, driving growth in the Superchain ecosystem. On September 26th, Swan Network concluded its grand Lagrange Mars Testnet campaign with major achievements. In sum, 28 Computing Providers worldwide offered diverse computing resources. In total, over 130 GPUs were deployed from 9 countries and 17 cities, supplying over 100,000 hours of GPU service and 150,000 hours of CPU service to the network of builders. Over 100,000 stunning images were created using the Stable Diffusion space on Lagrange, and 40,000 images have been uploaded into Multi-Chain Storage and backed up on IPFS and Filecoin storage. Swan Network (formerly FilSwan), built as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is designed to enhance decentralized computing networks. It integrates a tool suite that streamers developers’ access to resources across multiple blockchains. We launched the Swan Testnet with the vision of an open marketplace for cloud resources. To bring this vision to life, we’ve chosen to build Swan Testnet on Optimism’s OP Stack, making Swan Chain the newest addition to the Superchain ecosystem. With the ever-growing Artificial Intelligence need for computing resources and Web3 DApps deployment, GPUs are the new oil in this ecosystem that powers the growth of innovation. With the scale of geographically distributed computing power that Swan Network can provide (Currently covering 9 countries and 17 cities), Swan aims to continue expanding its ability to support the needs of the growing ecosystem. Multichain Payment Channel: Swan Testnet introduces a multichain payment channel built with Chainlink functions that enable users to pay with stablecoins like USDC on various networks, including, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Your payments will be seamlessly converted into SWAN tokens on Optimism, providing a new income source for Computing Providers. SWAN, the native utility token of Swan Network, has a lot of features and benefits, however, any token that has intrinsic volatility poses a problem for long-term providers and users. The incorporation of alternate settlement currencies is one way to address the issue of long-term volatility. The stablecoin USDC, which is based on the US dollar, will be used for the implementation of stable payments. Future additions of settlement currencies can be made with a straightforward governance proposal. AI/Web3 Computing Support: Swan Testnet is committed to democratizing AI resources. We provide computing support to the Optimism ecosystem, empowering machine learning models and Web3 applications. Users can also access the Lagrange platform and generate DataNFT which is backed up to IPFS and Filecoin storage via Multi-Chain Storage and verified by Chainlink Functions. With the booming of AI and Web3, a shortage of computing power is becoming a non-ignorable problem. Traditionally, major providers like Google Cloud and AWS, not only charge a large sum for the GPUs but are also hard to access for many startups. This acts as a barrier of entry for many AI and Web3 projects and consequentially blocks innovation. Universal Basic Income (UBI) Trial: SWAN’s UBI system ensures fair compensation for network providers, even during periods of inactivity. As a part of the Swan Testnet, the UBI Trial program allows every eligible Computing Provider to participate and win UBI rewards. This pioneering initiative aims to provide stability and support to providers and provide a basic level of compensation to qualified providers. Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program: To meet the growing demand for geographically distributed computing resources across the Swan ecosystem, we’re launching the Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program during the Swan Testnet. Computing Providers from areas without a representative CP can earn additional rewards of 600 SWAN, fostering diversity and participation in underrepresented regions. Referral Rewards: All Computing Providers, whether existing or new CPs, can earn referral rewards by referring qualified CPs. For each qualified referral, you will receive 300 SWAN tokens as a referral reward, encouraging a thriving community. To further our mission and encourage more Computing Providers to join us in building an open cloud resource market, we are excited to launch the Jupiter incentivized testnet campaign. Running from November 20th, 2023, 00:00 (EST) to December 20th, 2023, 23:59 (EST), this campaign offers a prize pool of 150,000 SWAN. It provides a unique opportunity to stress-test our latest features, including the multichain payment channel, the Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program, Universal Basic Income (UBI), and more.

The token is at the core of the IQ Ecosystem, and the community can discover more on the utility and opportunities which the token brings in our Tokenomics blog post. The time is almost here to reward our loyal community members for their participation in the IQ Protocol FT staking program. The PARSIQ community has had the opportunity to stake $PRQ since June 30, 2021 upon the launch of IQ Protocol mainnet. While staking pools for $MYST went live on January 13, 2022, followed by $NIOX on March 7, 2022. The good news? All participants in the staking program are eligible for $IQT rewards 🥳 Note: A snapshot was taken 31 Oct 2023 23:59:59 GMT+0000 to determine the rewards for each wallet address How will the distribution of $IQT work? Distribution calculation: The amount of tokens staked and the duration of each staking period will determine the eligibility and distribution of each airdrop wallet. $PRQ stakers will receive 90% of the 10M $IQT reward pool, $MYST stakers 7% and $NIOX stakers 3%. How will the claim work? After $IQT TGE, all users will be able to see their individual airdrop allocations & corresponding value on the IQ Wallet Dashboard by connecting their wallet. No further action will be required. Our team will provide the URL once this dashboard is LIVE. *Please note: There will be a vesting period for all airdrop recipients. Vesting: Airdrop recipients will have a 6 month cliff immediately following TGE. Unlocks will be linear over the subsequent 12 month period on a block by block basis. Why is this vesting period necessary? This vesting period is vital for our launch strategy. With our DEX only launch there will be a limited supply of tokens for the initial period. All private investor and team allocation are locked for 6 months followed by a linear 18–24 month unlocks (depending on the round). No liquid $IQT tokens have been exchanged in any marketing or services. The good news for airdrop recipients? Airdropped tokens will be fully unlocked before investors, team and advisory allocations 🔥 What happens if I’ve staked after the snapshot was taken? Unfortunately, you will not be eligible for this airdrop. But, don’t worry there will be more 🤫 For those who staked just prior to the snapshot or staked a low amount, our team has decided upon what we believe is a fair mechanism to reward all stakers. We will be airdropping 10 $IQT to every person in the staking pool if their reward was set to be anywhere from >0 to <10 $IQT. Questions about the Airdrop? Please ask inside of our Telegram or Discord communities. With our DEX only launch strategy, our team has made the decision to convert all whitelist holders into airdrop recipients. How does this work? Initially, we will be rewarding only 100 people with whitelists for $IQT. Approximately 60% of these have already been claimed, which means there will be NEW ways for our community to win whitelists… details soon 🤑 Whitelisters: Will receive 1000 $IQT tokens per wallet via the same airdrop/claim mechanism mentioned above for stakers. Vesting: Whitelist recipients will have a 6 month cliff immediately following TGE. With the full amount of tokens claimable upon the completion of the 6 months cliff. Whitelist winners will be able to see their 1000 $IQT allocation by visiting the IQ Wallet Dashboard and connecting their wallet. No further action will be required. Our team will provide the URL once this dashboard is LIVE. How to claim WL: An additional step is required to claim your airdrop. Simply put, we need your wallet address.

Functioning as reliable intermediaries, these oracles empower smart contracts by facilitating access to off-chain data. This dynamic capability enables smart contracts to seamlessly execute actions based on real-world events and information, enhancing the versatility and practicality of decentralized systems. If you’re a supporter of decentralized oracles, chances are you’ve encountered Witnet and Tellor in your exploration. In this instalment of the Witnet Oracle Comparison Series (WOCS), we’ll delve into the distinctions and parallels between Witnet and Tellor. It’s crucial to highlight that Winet 2.0 is still in development and hasn’t gone live yet. However, the Witnet Oracle Comparison Series aims to draw comparisons with other blockchain Oracle projects, offering insights into the anticipated potential of Winet 2.0. Now that we’ve grasped the significance of decentralized oracles in the blockchain realm, let’s shift our focus to understanding Witnet and Tellor. In this series, we’ll explore Witnet and Tellor as integral components of the Decentralized Oracle Network: Witnet and Tellor share a common goal as blockchain-based projects that strive to offer decentralized oracle services, tackling the challenge of integrating real-world data into blockchain networks. Despite their shared objective, they diverge in their approaches and features. Let’s delve into a concise comparison of Witnet and Tellor within the context of a Decentralized Oracle Network: Witnet 2.0 signifies a major advancement as it evolves into the first-ever Layer 1 Proof of Stake Oracle. Pioneering a focus on security and decentralization, Witnet stands out as the leading and only genuinely decentralized Oracle network. Essentially, Witnet is meticulously designed as a layer 1 blockchain oracle with a dedicated mission — to securely deliver off-chain data onto any smart contract network in a permissionless and decentralized manner. Tellor stands as a decentralized, transparent, and permissionless Oracle protocol, offering smart contracts timely access to data whenever required. In essence, it serves as a secure and trustless avenue for Ethereum network smart contracts to obtain off-chain data. By decentralizing the on-chain integration of real-world data, Tellor ensures immutability and complete permissionlessness in its operations. Witnet is constructed with a focus on achieving true decentralization, while Tellor is purposefully designed as a decentralized oracle network. Both platforms operate on a permissionless basis, allowing individuals to engage in resolving data queries almost instantly, without the need for prior approval. This emphasis on permissionlessness underscores their commitment to open and inclusive participation in their respective ecosystems. Let’s delve deeper into the distinctive features of Witnet and Tellor in the context of their blockchain functionalities: Witnet is constructed on its dedicated Layer 1 blockchain, and it boasts a blockchain-agnostic nature, allowing seamless integration with various blockchain platforms. Unlike being confined to a specific blockchain, Witnet stands out as the sole Oracle operating on its distinct Layer 1, purposefully designed to address the Oracle problem with unparalleled focus and efficiency. Tellor, in contrast to being blockchain-agnostic, is primarily designed for Ethereum-based applications. However, it showcases versatility by being compatible with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, as well as Algorand. The Tellor Layer, engineered on the Cosmos SDK, is specifically crafted to manage different data types across a spectrum of emerging chains. While Tellor has its roots in Ethereum, its adaptability extends to various EVM-compatible chains and beyond, demonstrating a flexibility that caters to a diverse blockchain ecosystem. Compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) doesn’t inherently render a project or protocol fully blockchain-agnostic. Rather, it signifies the ability to operate on any blockchain that supports the EVM. This includes not only various Ethereum forks but also other blockchain platforms that implement the EVM. True blockchain-agnosticism would imply seamless integration and functionality across a broader range of diverse blockchain architectures beyond the EVM ecosystem. Let’s delve into the distinctive features of Witnet and Tellor in terms of their consensus mechanisms: Witnet’s transition to Witnet 2.0 marks a pivotal moment in its development, particularly with the shift from a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake system to a dedicated Proof of Stake mechanism. This strategic evolution underscores a commitment to a more stakeholder-centric approach in determining consensus. Importantly, this move aligns with the prevailing industry trend favouring energy-efficient and environmentally friendly consensus mechanisms, reflecting Witnet’s dedication to sustainability and innovation within the blockchain space. The Witnessing Network The Witnessing Network welcomes participants globally, allowing individuals from anywhere in the world to become Witnet nodes or witnesses. These nodes, ensuring anonymity, have staked a specific amount of the network token, $WIT. This staking serves as a commitment that participants could potentially lose if they provide inaccurate or false information. The decentralized and global nature of the Witnessing Network contributes to its robustness and reliability in validating and securing data within the Witnet ecosystem. How it works? Witnet’s consensus mechanism is orchestrated by a sophisticated algorithm that selects anonymous nodes. These nodes are required to stake WIT tokens to participate, offering a customizable approach to decentralization levels. In Witnet 2.0, a node’s eligibility is determined by a function called “Power,” derived from its total stake multiplied by stake age. This Power is reset upon task completion, ensuring a continual rotation of nodes to prevent the concentration of control. To incentivize honest behaviour and discourage malicious actions, nodes face economic consequences, risking the potential loss of staked funds. The commit and reveal scheme further enhances data integrity in data requests. Nodes post collateral, commit to the provided data, and later reveal it publicly. This process adds an extra layer of trustless participation. Notably, Witnet encourages broad and trustless engagement by allowing anyone to run an anonymous node in the network. Tellor utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism, incorporating elements from both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). The intention, as outlined in the Tellor X Whitepaper, is to phase out the Proof of Work mining component. This strategic adjustment indicates a conscious move towards a consensus model that is not only more energy-efficient but also places a greater emphasis on stakeholders’ participation. Such a shift aligns with broader industry trends that prioritize sustainability and decentralized engagement within blockchain networks. The Reporting Network Tellor embraces global participation, allowing individuals from any corner of the world to become data reporters and contribute information to Tellor’s databases. However, it’s crucial to note that staked Tellor network tokens, $TRB, are at risk of being lost in the event of incorrect data submission. This mechanism ensures a commitment to data accuracy and incentivizes contributors to provide reliable and truthful information to the Tellor network. How it works? The Tellor system operates on a decentralized and participatory model where anyone can deposit a stake and contribute data. During a specified timeframe, individuals have the opportunity to pay a dispute fee to challenge any piece of data provided. The resolution of the dispute is determined through a voting process involving Tellor stakeholders. If the data reporter loses the dispute, their stake is transferred to the party raising the dispute. This structure establishes a robust system that penalizes malicious actors while rewarding those who contribute accurate and reliable information to the Tellor network. For a more detailed description, please see Tellor at a Glance or Tellor the Basics. The introduction of Witnet 2.0 signifies a substantial enhancement in decentralization, robustness, and security. This upgrade positions Witnet on a trajectory to emerge as the pioneering true Proof of Stake Oracle. This evolution underscores a commitment to advancing the network’s resilience and security while embracing a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, marking a significant milestone in Witnet’s journey. Let’s dive further to explore the native assets of Witnet and Tellor along with their respective utilities: The $WIT coin plays a multifaceted role within the Witnet protocol, serving as the native currency for network fees on Layer 1. Additionally, $WIT is utilized for staking on nodes, a process integral to executing tasks within the network. The implementation of economic penalties, where nodes stand to lose a portion of their staked amount for misbehaviour, creates a potent incentive for honest behaviour, thereby bolstering the overall robustness of Witnet. This staking methodology significantly contributes to the network’s high level of security. In fact, it is estimated that malicious nodes would need more than the total supply of $WIT to substantially compromise a protocol relying on Witnet data feeds. This robust security framework is a testament to the effectiveness of the staking mechanism in deterring malicious actions and maintaining the integrity of the Witnet network. In the Tellor protocol, security and the encouragement of active data reporting are achieved through the creation of a token known as Tellor Tributes (TRB). Reporters are required to stake TRB to partake in the process of placing values on-chain. Additionally, users have the option to tip TRB tokens as an incentive for timely updates pertaining to the data their smart contracts depend on. To further incentivize the liveness of the reporter network, the Oracle contract on the Ethereum mainnet disburses time-based rewards. To deter malicious behaviour, the protocol has a dispute mechanism in place. Reporters can be disputed, and a portion of their stakes can be slashed by any TRB holder willing to contribute a dispute fee. This mechanism adds an extra layer of security and accountability, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the data reported by the Tellor network. The native assets of Witnet and Tellor play pivotal roles within their respective ecosystems, performing various essential functions. Let's delve into the tokenomics of Witnet ($WIT) and Tellor ($TRB): Key information about the Witnet token ($WIT): For a more detailed description, please see: Witnet Price Key information about the Tellor Tributes token ($TRB): It’s notable that Tellor does not have a maximum supply, which means that new tokens may continue to be mined or added to circulation over time. For a more detailed description, please see: Tellor Tributes Price Let’s have a little fun with the numbers. To explore the hypothetical scenario where the Witnet token ($WIT) had a market capitalization equivalent to that of the Tellor token ($TRB): Calculating this would give you the hypothetical price of $WIT in this fun scenario. Keep in mind that this is purely for entertainment purposes, and cryptocurrency prices are influenced by various factors in the market. As we wrap up this instalment of the Witnet Oracle Comparison Series (WOCS), let’s dive into some compelling statistics that underscore their relevance: Other noteworthy metrics in the realm of blockchain oracles include factors such as Total Value and the number of Secured Protocols. Witnet has demonstrated its robustness by safeguarding hundreds of millions in on-chain value across more than 300 data feeds spanning over 28 blockchain networks. As reported by Defillama, the key metrics are as follows: Total Value Secured: $62.18mProtocols Secured: 12 Tellor’s statistics are not publicly disclosed, with the team asserting that accurate calculation is challenging and that such information would lack meaningful insights. For further clarity, please refer to the quoted message included in the screenshot from the Tellor Discord. In the grander scheme, both Witnet and Tellor play integral roles in propelling the evolution of decentralized oracle technology. Their contributions collectively forge a path toward a more trustless and secure blockchain ecosystem. If you didn’t have time to read “The Quest for True Decentralized Oracle,” here’s a quick Comparison Table for Witnet vs. Tellor. In essence, Witnet and Tellor share a common goal of offering decentralized Oracle services. However, Witnet distinguishes itself by being blockchain-agnostic, prioritizing privacy, and employing a specific protocol for consensus. In contrast, Tellor is specifically tailored for Ethereum-based applications but exhibits compatibility with any EVM chain, including Algorand. Moreover, Tellor introduces its native token (TRB) for staking and governance within the network. The selection between the two may hinge on individual use cases, platform preferences, and the specific features sought for a given project.

Saga, a leading Layer-1 protocol and developer ecosystem in web3 gaming, today launched their Incentivized Testnet, named Pegasus, giving game creators even more freedom to unleash their creative expression on Saga. The kickoff is the first step leading to a six-part launch sequence for the full-featured Saga Protocol V1 Mainnet scheduled for early 2024 that will unblock developers and consumers from realizing blockchain’s true potential. First revealed at the Saga Multiverse Summit in August, Pegasus has undergone accelerated development from its original roadmap to support both Saga’s Innovators and partners. For Pegasus documentation, visit this link. The Saga Protocol offers an integrated stack of automated, high performance, gasless, interoperable and customizable chains, called Chainlets. The Saga Chainlet Realm will be the main Realm on the protocol. Earlier this year, Saga unveiled Realms, the technical manifestation of the Saga Multiverse — Saga’s platform that allows disparate tech stacks and IPs to deploy on the protocol and interact with each other through parallelized and interoperable dedicated chains. Saga Realms enables developers to launch customizable chains on Saga with different features and services such as technology stack, security source and various obligations for those sources. Under the framework of Realms, the standard Saga Chainlet became one Realm of many that will be supported in the near future, including those for our partners at Ethereum (Ethlets), Polygon, Avalanche, Celestia, XPLA and many others. Today’s launch will support configurable Realms out of the gate. The Pegasus Incentivized Testnet features the Saga Chainlet Realm and the following architectural components necessary for all other Realms to be onboarded. Together, the security chain and the platform chain will constitute the Saga Mainnet. Saga recognizes its strength lies in its community. As part of the Incentivized Testnet launch, Saga is rolling out a campaign whereby developers, end users, validators, and members of their community who participate in launch quests and exhibit helpful behaviors for the Saga ecosystem will be part of an airdrop* of SAGA tokens. The first group to receive tokens are Saga’s Innovators — developers currently building on Saga — the heart and soul of the protocol who will require the most lead-time to complete their quest. Details of the Innovators quest requirements are available here. Saga’s high-level tokenomics can be found here, and the claims process for airdrops and any additional incentives connected to launch will be revealed shortly. Saga will be adding quest details for the community in the coming weeks. “Saga has the best community any protocol could ask for. Seeing our Innovators showcasing their creativity in this Incentivized Testnet, we are more positioned for success than ever,” said Rebecca Liao, Co-Founder and CEO of Saga. “We have seen incredible gaming apps get to demo-able state and cannot wait to take them live on the Saga platform. We are fully committed to do everything we can to support their growth.” Last month, Saga also revealed the members of Cohort 5, the latest class of Innovators welcomed into the Saga ecosystem, with a diverse representation of global game developers. The induction of this latest group brings the number of Innovator projects to 282, with over 300 expected to be in the program by the Mainnet launch in 2024. The full list and individual information about Cohort 5 is available here. If you’re a project and are interested in building on Saga, apply to our Innovator Program here! *Note: The airdrop is not and will not be available to U.S. persons (or persons acting on behalf of U.S. persons). In order to participate in the airdrop, a person or entity must not be a U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902 under the United States Securities Act of 1933 or a U.S. person within the meaning Section 7701(a)(30) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. A full terms and conditions for participation in the airdrop will be made available as part of the claims process.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

Oumuamua on its way out of Solar system had a higher-than-expected velocity, and its trajectory shifted outside of the expected hyperbolic trajectory: Newton’s gravitational force F (between masses m and M at distance R by formula F=G×m×M/R², where G is some constant) is responsible for circular and elliptical planetary (and asteroids’) orbits, and for parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories of asteroids: Amazingly, the Oumuamua problem is very similar to the well-known Mercury’s precession problem discovered by U. Le Verrier in 1859 and solved by Einstein in 1915. In Mercury Precession without Space Bending Illusion, we discussed a simple solution for the Mercury’s problem: As we can see, the direction of deviation from a classic (in blue) trajectory depends only on whether time ahead of the object slows down or speeds up. If the object heads into slower time, then speed of the object increases compared to the speed by Newton’s laws just because of time dilation effect, and the object shifts outside of the expected classic orbit (does not matter elliptical or hyperbolic): In the case of Mercury, slower time happens to be closer to the Sun (“gravitational time dilation”). Rate of time dilation around the Sun is about 2 millionth (for 1 second passed on the Sun surface, 1.000002 seconds pass far away from the Sun, for example, on the Earth ). But with Oumuamua trajectory there is an opposite and stronger time dilation effect to consider: time flow outside the Milky Way arms is slower than time flow inside the arms, approximately by the factor of 1.001 (see explanation in chapter 2 of Time Matters). Our Solar system is in the Orion Spur of the Sagittarius Arm at the moment, and Oumuamua was leaving not only the Solar system, but Orion Spur and the Milky Way’s plane as well. Thus, it headed in the direction of slower time with the factor of 1.001, and that factor overpowers 1.000002 time-speeding factor (caused by leaving the slower time zone with the factor of 1.000002 in vicinity of the Sun). Time speed/dilation variation caused by leaving the arm (+0.001) is 3 orders of magnitude stronger than the opposite effect ( — 0.000002) on time speed caused by leaving the Sun. Thus, slower time outside of the galactic spur/arm/plane solves the problem of the asteroid’s increased velocity and the trajectory shift “outside” (gravitational force by Newton’s formula does not compensate for the velocity increase): But there is more to it 👉 All We Know about Physics of Time in 4 Pages "

As most cases require the GenAI model to have “long-term memory” almost every enterprise solution requires a vector database the model can query at run time to retrieve the context required to answer the user inquiry. But, according to researchers from Cornell University, the now once-thought as highly secure solution hides a troublesome truth that could cause huge privacy concerns. Also, this discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today. If there’s a ubiquitous element in today’s frontier AI, that is embeddings. Embeddings sit at the core of models like ChatGPT, and almost all progress made over the last years in AI can be traced down one way or another to these elements. When working with non-numerical data, for decades, AI researchers found themselves with an insurmountable problem.

I was a small town boy not afraid to offend a few ears to get some good laughs. And I definitely got laughs. I stole a few jokes, and had a few of my own, but I was spending a lot of time reading jokes. And during that time, I found the funniest joke ever written. The thing is, the funniest joke ever written will make you laugh for hours. Maybe not at the same time, but it will linger with you forever. You will be able to think back to that very joke, and it will be funny. But every time you hear it, it will be just a little less funny. When we laugh, we release endorphins, dopamine and oxytocin, which are all feel-good, reward and trust chemicals which act magically in your brain. Depending on what culture you’re in, clever jokes will make you laugh. When you’re a kid, pretty much anything can make you laugh. A hand sticking up from behind a person’s head, a pacifier choo-choo train, just saying literal non-sense can make you crack up. The laugh reflex never really goes away as you get older. We retain the ability to laugh as its a social lubricant. Being able to laugh allows you open up and trust, and build meaningful relationships with people, biologically, fueled by inter and intrasexual selection. Retaining the reflex also helps aiding in play, which is a part of childrearing, another biological motive to keep it. But think about this: when you are actually consuming content, if it makes you laugh, you are more likely to engage with it, liking it, responding etc, and even more, reading the comment section. So there is a good reason to understand what makes people laugh. Yet, few people really get to the base of it. I learned a good amount during a 6 month course in comedy, and the takeaways were that I probably still had a ways to go. But a comedy show isn’t usually all funny. There is a strategy in making comedy that few people understand or take the time to analyze, and the strategy revolves around knowing the essence of the jokes you… "

They drained Niagara Falls. When the water slowed down to a trickle the engineers discovered something equally horrific and shocking! Let’s dive into the discovery! I’m personally intrigued! Is it treasure, fossils, rocks, a human body or an animal? Lying on the riverbed were a million coins. As they explored the exposed bedrock even further they stumbled across human remains. The engineers want to drain the Niagara Falls once again and what they might discover now would completely surprise the world! In the coming years the waters on the American side of Niagara Falls will be diverted to the Canadian side and the rock bed will be completely exposed! Back in 1969, the researchers needed to explore the riverbed and they wanted to examine the walls of the river to identify the points of erosion and to better understand the rock composition of this area! This time around the engineers will take the opportunity of a drained Niagara Falls to replace the bridges that have been in use for over a century! There are two main parts of this story!

While we know that when very massive stars die, their cores collapse and that can lead to the formation of black holes, we know there must be other ways to form them: It may even be possible, although there are some compelling physics reasons to think not, that the Universe was born with primordial black holes: a population of black holes that sprang into existence long before the very first stars ever formed. These scenarios are particularly important when it comes to explaining the existence of the earliest supermassive black holes ever seen, as many of them are what we call “overmassive” or “outsized,” where it’s very difficult to explain how they got so massive, so quickly, especially considering the environments they’re in. With the newest cosmic record breaker — black hole UHZ1, the most distant ever discovered — the cosmic mystery just deepened in an unexpected way. Here’s why scientists are fascinated. Starting in the late 1950s, we began observing energetic sources in the Universe that didn’t match any known class of object. As we moved beyond optical astronomy and started exploring the Universe in other wavelengths, new types of objects began to emerge. With the advent of radio astronomy, certain sources appeared to emit large amounts of radiation with either no visible-light counterpart or simply a single, unresolvable point of light. These… "

Work required my space and attention. I traced the arching bracts of fennel flowers as my sister-in-law summoned the courage to share the news that she carried like a ticking brown-paper parcel. My brother has had a heart attack. The flowers had lost their yellow brightness and drooped dramatically next to sprigs of lavender that retained their calm composure. I tried to catch their scent as I listened to whispered breaths from the other side of the deep, deep ocean. “He’s in the hospital, he’s okay — conscious, didn’t lose consciousness. He’s had meds and they’re doing tests and ... We’re waiting to hear what will happen next.” My brother is five years older than me but now we’re both settled into our 60s, it hardly matters. Autumn has arrived. My beautiful bouquet has changed from decoration to meditation as the flowers fold in on themselves, conserving their energy. I take my daily walk along the shore under heavy grey skies, fog blurring the horizon with the stone-grey sea.

We nod to each other but we don’t chat. We are the retired and semi-retired. We smile at families of sandpipers scurrying to and fro at the water’s edge like iron filings responding to a trickster magnet invisible beneath the sand. A quiet walk is our respite from the tide of daily demands, our responsibility for elderly parents and concern for adult children. Thankfully my niece was in town when my brother took ill.

Sure, for some, it meant noticing the racial injustice in the legal system and the stereotype-enforcing portrayals of black people in the media. It meant asking why Willie Horton’s face played such a prominent role in George Bush’s presidential campaign. But for others, it meant believing that soft drinks made black men infertile and that saying “Good morning” is racist. As we’re often reminded, language evolves. And in the 85 years since it was coined, “woke” has been used to describe everything from representation for children with disabilities to opposing regimes that imprison or execute gay people to making cartoon M&Ms “less sexy.” But in amongst all the usual “culture war” silliness, some of us saw something else. We saw people so obsessed with identity that they think treating each other as individuals is “dangerous."" We saw an aggressive political movement that refused to debate or compromise or even define itself. We saw cruelty and absolutism that were utterly at odds with liberal values. And sadly, after the reaction to the Hamas terror attacks, we’re seeing that it’s even worse than we thought. If I asked you to condemn the slaughter and rape of innocent people, you probably wouldn’t have too much trouble. You might go for something tried and tested, if mostly meaningless, like “I reject terrorism in the strongest possible terms.” You might spend some time deriding the cowardice of targeting unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. You might even clarify that you stand with oppressed people but stand against burning civilians alive and murdering babies. But believe it or not, some people have found this test of moral clarity surprisingly tricky. Take, for example, the World Workers Party, who described the Oct 7th terrorist attacks, in which 1400 innocent Israelis were raped and/or butchered, as “a heroic example for people longing for liberation.” "

I cheerfully described my father’s Kenyan origins and my mother’s roots in Scotland where I was born and raised. The nurse tsshed and spat, “So. You don’ belong to nobody!” It’s been forty years yet I remember it sharp as the slip of a knife. We continued our work, two brown hands of different shades tugging at the starched white bedsheet. By the time the hospital corners had been squared away to her satisfaction, I had silently decided that actually, I belonged to everyone — a frayed stitch holding my family’s histories together. It wouldn’t last a day of wear. My parents met at university, at a college dance in the days when those were formal affairs that required long dresses and black tie. Mum was standing with a group of women by the dance floor when one of the foreign students crossed towards them. A woman near my mother said something to the effect of, ‘Ugh, here comes a black — I hope he doesn’t ask me to dance!’ My mother was horrified and when ‘the black’ smiled at her with an invitation to dance, she instinctively stepped forward. Dad was a handsome and charming young man but the reason my mother first danced with him was spite. My father had been sent to Britain by a Scottish missionary as part of a deal with my grandfather back in Kenya. The mission would be given family land to build a hospital and my father would be educated to become a doctor in it. The struggle for Kenya’s independence was sliding toward its bloody climax and my grandfather’s collaboration with ‘colonial power’ was probably a risky endeavor at the time. It was risky for my father too. No one in the family had ever traveled so far from home and, with its inherently racist social systems, Britain would be chilly for him in more ways than one. When my parents married in the 1950s, my mother’s favorite aunt warned that her children would “inherit the worst characteristics of both races”. "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems. The signs started pretty soon after they celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary. "

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

And you don’t have a clue. That’s what I’m thinking, but, luckily, I’m able to summon the self-control to prevent myself from saying it. No, I decide to keep the insult inside my head where it belongs. After all, I’ve helped raise her, so I’m ultimately to blame. I pull up to the school entrance, put my car in park, and gaze at my 11-year-old daughter, who faces me just long enough for me to register the stink eye. She exits the car and slams the door behind her. I do nothing. Strike two. It isn’t even 9 a.m. — I haven’t had so much as a drop of coffee yet — and I’ve already managed to commit two of parenting’s biggest faux pas: losing my cool and failing to say goodbye when angry. I’m killing it over here. The little earthquake that erupted at drop-off this morning can be traced back to the breakfast table where my daughter explained why her friend, Blake, couldn’t participate in last Friday’s school-sponsored pajama day. Students who brought in canned goods for the Community Pantry Drive were allowed to wear pajamas to school that day; those who didn’t, couldn’t. (My husband calls bullshit on the whole thing and accuses school administrators of using kids’ desire to wear pjs to school as leverage, which inadvertently puts the children of parents who can’t afford to contribute in a precarious position. I agree with my husband, but that’s neither here nor there.) “Blake said that he told his mom too late, so she didn’t have time to get to the store,” my daughter explains between bites of her cereal. But that probably isn’t true. I know things about Blake’s mother’s financial situation — and not because I pry but because I can put two and two together: The countless times my daughter has asked me for extra lunch money (in case Blake forgot his); the time I’ve caught her putting two granola bars in her backpack for afternoon snack (again, in case Blake forgot his); the time I paid for Blake’s portion of the… "

Chronic knee pain stopped me from enjoying many fun aspects of life. Hiking, team sports, and as I got older, even stairs would spark a symphony of cracks and pops. Here’s how I bulletproofed my knees, hips, and ankles, for free, with one simple exercise practiced a few times per week. Today, chronic knee pain is a way of life for 25% of adults. Yet, most people aren’t born with degenerative knee diseases. And, our joints weren’t made to give way after just a few decades. The problem is our way of life. We sit too much, work too much, and exercise the same parts of our bodies over and over again. Missing the parts that really matter. How often have you heard someone say this? Probably about as often as you hear bodybuilders complain about shoulder pain or runners suffering from shin splints. The knees are the body’s 2 largest joints, and we use them for almost everything. Walking, crouching, sitting, standing, and bending over. Yet, most people don’t know how to strengthen them. Or, keep them healthy… Humans weren’t built to be the biggest or strongest mammals on Earth. But, our unique knee joints have given us a biological advantage over the rest of the animal kingdom. Yet we squander our gift. We walk primarily on flat ground, take elevators, and avoid movements that strengthen our knees. All of this, causes us to devolve much quicker than nature intended. Resulting in knee pain, painful surgeries, and the limiting belief that you were born with “bad knees”. "

Okay maybe not everyone, but I reckon it’s close. Almost everyone in therapy to work on their relationship issues can name their primary “language”. This simple classification was the brainchild of Dr Gary Chapman who wrote the classic book The Five Love Languages 30 years ago. He outlined five key ways we communicate with our partners. Quality time. Words of affirmation. Acts of Service. Physical Touch. Receiving Gifts. And readers loved it (and still do), primarily because it offers a solution to an age-old quest: to know how we love, and want to be loved. But those five love languages are not what we talk about in therapy. Nope, we talk much more about the other — extremely common — language that gets in the way of love. We talk about fear. Fear underpins many relationship struggles. Obviously being with a toxic partner ignites fear, so does having your trust broken by the one you’re with. But so do the fears we bring into our relationships, those embedded in us from a difficult “love history.” I worked with a woman whose five-year marriage had just broken up. She was struggling with two of the most common fears in love — abandonment and rejection. She had a painful history of loss — the death of loved family members but also betrayal in her relationships — and it had left her hypersensitive in love. She had developed a pattern of getting close to someone then pulling back, finding ways to critique her partner or pick the relationship apart before she could be rejected. She’d lost some potentially good partners along the way. “I’m aware of what I’m doing,” she said, “but it’s almost like if I’m going to be dumped I want it to be because of the way I behaved rather than who I am.” Ouch. You can see why love was both difficult and painful for her — and why her best intentions ended unhappily. "

Of course, everything from genetics to childhood experience has some influence on how confident you feel (or don’t). But by far the biggest influence on confidence is the one everyone seems to miss… In my work as a psychologist, I’ve found that there are a handful of confidence-killing habits people fall into without knowing it. And it’s these habits that are the real causes of chronically low confidence. If you can learn to identify and work through them, you’ll find that your natural levels of confidence are much higher than you realize. Reassurance-seeking is like outsourcing emotional labor onto other people. And not only does it kill your confidence, it also tends to sabotage your relationships and lead to people becoming resentful of you. Here’s a small example: "
https://medium.com/@ECIOspace/ecio-space-company-update-6cea4067571d?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Dear All! First and foremost we, at ECIO team, would like to thank every single person that played and supported our game up to this point. It has had ups and downs and you have helped us along the way to improve it. No, we are not going anywhere, just wanted to take this chance to thank you all. We will update you with separate announcement on following topics: Current Market and Our Plan ; In-Game Economics ; Future of the Game ; The Company. Our community is very important to us and we want to be transparent with the goals and the direction of the company, and we will allocate time to answer all of your questions that we are sure you will have. Hope you will understand our actions and stick with us through this difficult time. In the recent months, it was tough on NFT games, economy, blockchain and our company felt that, and with this we had to make some drastic changes to our game, business model and team, apart from game changes, we were required to make team reductions and updated company structure (more on that later). We have been discussing and deciding very carefully about the future of the company. Firstly, we have to change our priorities, and update our business model. We will be dropping the rewards (Play to Earn) aspect of the game, and replacing it with Free to Play style model. Reason for this action, is when looking at current state of our token, business model, and our player base, the project is not in financial sustainable state, and we would be force to close the project soon if we don’t make some changes; therefore we would be dropping token support, for a chance for our project to become more sustainable and fun to play with hopes to bring in more players to the game. This will take effect in the upcoming future. HOWEVER! We won’t make this change immediately, but instead with a steady decrease of rewards leading to complete drop for token support. More details coming soon about this. Don’t worry, we are not removing all earning aspects from the game! As we will keep NFT marketplace to still give you an option to earn money from improving your characters and selling them to other players. This is one of the most crucial and impactful changes coming to the project, with the current economy (in-game and out of game) taking a big hit. In the foreseeable future we will be dropping rewards, however the drops and decrease in rewards will be sequential that will occur weekly. We will provide more detailed breakdown soon, but initial changes will include: These initial changes took effect on 22 August 2022. Main reason for this is current in-game economy is not sustainable, with us still trying to find sustainable game model. We made this change to drop blockchain tokens as we believe in the project, blockchains, and NFT and we don’t want the project to crash and die, and we want to make any changes necessary for it to continue and survive. We apologise for the drastic changes, however we hope you stay with us for the upcoming changes as we have very exciting news coming your way, that we hope will improve the game drastically! Main focus for the future of the game: Multiplayer. The original NFT aspect of the game will remain the same, and even improved by adding skins, and other cosmetic customisations, to the warriors to make them feel personalised and unique, this aspect will be used in the multiplayer mode, and we believe this is unique and fun aspect of the game which is crucial to keep. Also, unfortunately we will be temporarily stopping the comic production to save on our monthly expenses. To give ourselves best chance of survival and keep game alive for longer and hopefully bring more players in, and create hype back up around the game, we are working and implementing multiplayer mode, which would be a team battle arena where users will be in a team and will battle against each-other on the battlefield. This change is not to say we will be abandoning single player. The story aspect to the game is still something we would very much like to develop and improve on, but at this moment and time it is on our development plan after multiplayer has been released successfully. The upcoming multiplayer mode would be in MOBA genre, where it would be a 2D map, 4v4 real-time battle arena, where your team composition and teamwork will be tested to win. We are prioritising gameplay, with thrilling action, strategy and teamwork! Your current characters are the ones you actually use in the arena, so your character parts combinations will be crucial in your team success. With a release not only on web platform, but also on mobile soon after! More details about this whole mode will come soon, so stay tuned! For now we can only share with you our concept map for the multiplayer mode. Our community is super important to us and throughout our development we want to keep you updated on progress with visual updates whenever possible. With this big economic hit, we made drastic changes to the game economy, focus and direction, as well as our team. We were forced to make tough decisions, and lower our monthly expenses to maximise our chance of success and project survival. Therefore, we had to have company re-structure and have company re-organization, keeping only most crucial members in the company. Main key members and positions changes include: We want to be closer to community, therefore all of us will talk to community directly when possible, as we believe community is very important for us to make this project survival happen. You will be able to find us on the Social Channels, we are there! We know these are big changes, however, we believe it will work and we want to do AMA, will announce time and date soon, where we will answer any questions about ECIO project and direction that you may have. Thank you all for supporting us until this point and we hope you will stay with us for the upcoming exciting journey! ECIO Team "
https://medium.com/@ECIOspace/ecio-ama-august-2022-205093e6ce25?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"With our upcoming changes announced in August 2022, we at ECIO team, wanted to conduct AMA where we would gather questions from community. Following on this post are these questions that we have gathered and the answers for those questions. These questions were collected from our ECIO Discord server and Thai community Telegram channel. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Yes, the complete roadmap will be released soon that will contain all the details, however what we are happy to share for now is, F2P conversion completion happens in end of Q3, and Multiplayer release is end of Q4 2022. These are our main focus for now, followed by Mobile release in Q1 ’23, and improvements to single player experience happening afterwards. The tokens will be kept as an in-game only currency. This means players will be able to use ECIO and LKM to upgrade their warriors, change parts and customize them but it won’t be possible to use them as a cryptocurrency We aim to keep in-game tokens (just separate it from the blockchain aspect), therefore we don’t want to reduce the in-game rewards, instead we reducing amount of tokens available to withdraw until tokens blockchain support is fully removed. It is something we are looking at and is currently under consideration at the moment. No it’s not possible. We understand the frustration it may cause to players that have invested bigger amount in the game. We don’t want to put any of our investors at disadvantage and want everyone to have equal chance to withdraw their tokens, disregarding how much they have put into the game. This is not really a question, but a request. As answered in other question, we are keeping tokens after the transition to F2P therefore we cannot remove in-game rewards. We understand it is frustrating period to go through, but we prioritize growth of the project, and difficult decisions had to be made in these times. One of them was to reduce withdrawn daily amounts to progressive blockchain support drop, instead of sudden token crash and no more support given (which it was leading towards and would happen very soon). We actually did promotions both before the game launch and afterwards, unfortunately the interest on P2E games has decreased dramatically, the truth is that there is no interest on P2E games anymore, there is no new people joining on projects and the overall situation on the crypto community has reached a point where we cannot keep continuing. There are lots of good projects out there completely closing because there are just no people joining them, this sadden us more than you guys can imagine, we have put our heart and soul on ECIO and turning the game into a F2P is the only way for the project to survive Let us clarify that those that we are still working on ECIO are all part of the original team, we didn’t switch and sold ECIO to another company or anything like that. What happened is that unfortunately and how we already explained, the situation at the crypto space and the project itself wasn’t sustainable anymore, we had to cut expenses on team members and for this reason we had to say goodbye to a lot of very talented and awesome workmates and friends. Mentioned in one of previous questions. There is roadmap we are working with, which will be released and available publicly soon. We are waiting for Q3 blockchain drop, followed by Q4 multiplayer release, with Q1 ’23 Mobile version release, with single player improvements coming afterwards. Play to Earn model at the moment is not sustainable and we are experimenting in finding a solution that’s sustainable. It is not to say Play to Earn won’t come back, however it is not something that we have plans for at this current point and time. The currency gathered from the fees has been being used to add gas to the several smart contracts so they can run. The player activity and the fees imposed are not enough to create funds to add to the liquidity pools. This is valid question. We maybe don’t have the same team as before, but we still have marketing assistance, and also will have marketing plan in place to give this project as best chance of success as possible. We believe in the project, the story and all the individual aspects of it. We are focusing now more gameplay experience and improving it from player perspective, however apart from that it does have unique aspects which sets it aside from competitors, we have 2D environment alongside character customization options available not in many competitor titles, and believe this hybrid NFT — it may not stand out to many as big factor, but there are players that would like this aspect of the project too. We want to make it fun. If it’s fun, people will come. Yes. Within next 1 month, 1 and half months money support will drop. Our focus in near future will be in developing and playing with Multiplayer mode experience, to allow PvP gameplay. We are still have plans to improve single player, and expand single player mode with new missions and challenges, but it will occur after the release of the multiplayer mode. End of the year, and Q1 ’23, we plan to complete multiplayer mode to release state, and release it to players on web and mobile platforms. Multiplayer mode will initially be 4v4 online battle arena. Full set of details on multiplayer mode, alongside development updates coming soon. Timeline, alongside regular development logs and guidelines will be updated and released and distributed to community soon. It will be available on our main page. We do think community is very important for this project success and we listen to community feedback and consider all opinions and feedback. Going forward with multiplayer development and F2P plan, we would like community to provide feedback on ongoing changes from update logs and development logs, alongside any visual feedback that’s presented, as this feedback may impact and change some behavior/features that would be used in the game. At the end of the game, we do really appreciate all of your feedback, and we want to make the game that is enjoyable to play, and we want to build a strong community around this project. The original vision was and it’s still is to create an engaging and fun game with a deep focus on it’s lore and particular art design as well as a social game emphasized by it’s team multiplayer mode. We always wanted it to be a team game where you could play with your friends or meet new friends along the way, and with the multiplayer mode we will achieve that. We are working on these parts to be available in multiplayer mode, as they will play big part in multiplayer battles. These parts are in development plan to be completed in Q1 ’23. Of course, after they been added, they will be available to use in the Single player modes too. Sadly no. With all the upcoming changes and development plan, we were forced to move mobile schedule to Q1 ’23. There is still plan to release the mobile version. It is interesting idea to do this sort of upgrade plan! It is something that we will consider adding in the future, as upgrading your individual parts stats would add additional level of upgradeablity and can play a big part in character power levels. However, it is a plan in a future, and as it is now we only have plans to upgrade characters with the current star system. We know some of you have asked this already. No, we have not terminated the Comics, we were however forced to postpone the production of comics. We will continue producing the production of comics as soon as we have enough resources available for it. It is aspect of the project we would like to keep, as we do like the story of the project. Unfortunately it is not possible with current implementation, with no future plans for this feature. This is not something we have discussed or considered at this moment and time. We have plans for ECIO and LKM to be used in the endgame, to use the in-game tokens inside the game for upgrades. It is to come with F2P and is one of the planned developments in the F2P transition. It would not be coming with initial F2P release, but it is something coming to the platform. This lottery gamble idea with ECIO is interesting, and may be something that we would add in future. We did not have time at this moment to discuss ideas like this, but we will take it into consideration and possibly add it in the future to the project. Yes, definitely. We are not abandoning any of the existing game modes, quite the opposite. We want to create and release PvP mode to allow more multiplayer battles, but after that, we want to release the updates to adventure modes and improve their gameplay to make it more enjoyable to play, with expansion of the story. The blockchain support will be dropped for tokens, however the NFT is still supported alongside marketplace. And all aspects of NFT will be fully supported inside the game, so none of it will become obsolete. In-game will offer loot box opening which will act similarly to gachapon, where user would be able to get hero, or some other useful parts in the game. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — We hope these answers answer the questions you have, and clarify some things going forwards.

https://medium.com/@ECIOspace/public-game-launch-withdrawn-system-and-alpha-pass-users-announcement-abe4dc25fbc?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"In the first days of the closed Alpha Mainnet, we’ve been collecting feedback to ensure a smooth game environment at launch. One of the key changes that we have made is a rebalancing of difficulty and rewards. Mission mode stages are now exponentially harder to complete, making it so that players will have to upgrade weaker teams to be able to progress. There are several deadlocks (e.g. level 4) which need time and effort to complete, Warriors need to gain a higher level to be able to pass these deadlocks. To facilitate a fair start for all players, those who had access to the closed Alpha, will see their Warrior’s level and stage progress reset. The gained rewards will remain untouched. WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM RELEASE To safeguard the course of $Lakrima in the early days, we have implemented a withdrawal system that has set limitations in April and May. There are 6 phases, each kicking off a week from each other, with relaxed withdrawal rates each week. In the first phase, between 20 Apr — 27Apr, there will be a dynamic fee between 5% — 25%. The first withdrawal will have a tax of 10,000 ECIO, with an increment of 200% at each following withdrawal. This increment will be reset after 72 hours of the first withdrawal. The max claim will be 50,000LKM per withdrawal. In the following phases, the dynamic fee, tax, height of increment, increment reset time and max claim period will reduce every week. After the 6th phase, the fees will be set to a baseline fee that will continue to be the standard for ongoing withdrawals. The table below shows the phases until 31 May 2022. *We reserve to change all the information based on the economic situation*All ECIO Tax and Random Fee will be Burn in every week "

https://medium.com/devteamspace/5-key-challenges-to-your-billion-dollar-startup-club-membership-163198de0231?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"The Billion Dollar Startup Club has a small but growing membership. It’s an exclusive group with very lucrative ideas accomplished through building outstanding applications and products. The newest members are Divyank and Bhavin Turakhia, brothers who created and parlayed the creation and sale of Directi and Media.net. Every startup wants to join Uber, Snapchat, What’s App, Spotify, and the club’s select membership. You may already be able to envision the payoff for your startup business plan. But, you still face at least five challenges to your Billion Dollar Startup Club membership, problems that only can be solved with a help of a solid engineering team. Not so fast A look at the Wall Street Journal’s Billion Dollar Startup Club reveals a lot of information. For example, it took Uber 7 years to turn its $11.46 billion funding into its current valuation of $68 billion. AirBnB took 8 years to roll its $2.95 billion into $25.5 billion. And, Slack has quickly turned a half billion into $3.8 billion. And very few people know that some of these unicorns were building their early apps with a help of agencies. For example, Slack has done that — proof. For starters, you need to assess the way you want to grow. Your app itself could be your business, or your app could serve operational or administrative processes. There are many startups that are perfectly happy holding membership in the half-billion club, and the Uber target is awfully high. Many individual members have settled for a strategy to develop, sell, and begin something new. They turn sweat equity into a seller’s market and then turn the sale equity into another startup triumph. The Wall Street Journal’s Billion Dollar Startup Club does let you explore histories, profiles, and funding track records. This alone should give you some sense of perspective when you are thinking big — as indeed you should. Making innovation transformational Some business owners succeed because they improve service at their dry cleaning establishment or reduce inventory at their retail store. Entrepreneurs contribute something more. They contribute something transformational. They introduce something that alters their market, changes market expectations, and/or redirects the entire community experience. You may want to change the world with your ideas in virtual reality, speech recognition, augmented reality, or the Internet. But, developing the app that gets you there means facing some real challenges because the transformational is rarely do-it-yourself. 1. Time is not your friend If you’re thinking world-class competition, you know success is a fast-track business. The marketplace needs apps now that it has become used to their potential, and the market’s attention span seems insatiable. Tim Merel of Digi-Capital, speaking of the billionaire rainmakers as “first movers,” says, “First movers have delivered unprecedented value at an unheard of rate, so dominating quickly is worth its weight in gold.” It’s a common recommendation to enter the market early with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a simple version of the ultimate plan. The idea is to whet the market’s appetite and work out the kinks before notching up the performance or features. But, contributors at Prado point out three problems to that strategy: 1. Smart customers can see through things, want the solution to your problem, and will wait for the better version. 2. Customers are not patient when competition is everywhere and unrelenting. 3. Everybody is an expert, blogging their appreciation or demeaning the result. These are opinions that can crush you. So if you are to move quickly, it makes sense to look for agencies’ / professional remote developers’ help to build an MVP. Slack and many other companies applied this tactics successfully. 2. Backend If you building a mobile app, it has to be Android-friendly, as well as iOS fitted. In the current environment, you also need a cloud-based backend. As technology pulls innovation in every direction, you risk catastrophe if you trust everything to a single developer. You need a team of distinct, but related individual skills. You need a responsive, collaborative team that has already proven its ability. 3. Build it pretty Potential customer engagement begins with the app’s interface and experience. It needs vivid visuals: Illustration, logo, typography, and so on. It has to present a first impression that prompts the shopper to look further, to purchase, or to download. The first impression must provide intuitive access, and that depends on your team creating a user-friendly interface. 4. Start small; think big If you want the business to grow, you have to build scalability into your operations and into the technology. Growth on the business operations side means planning for increases in human capital, talent management, equity funding, and the like. The potential of product aging and shifting market tastes requires you to engineer applications that have room for maturity, adaptation, and change. Again, this sophistication calls for an experienced dev team with relevant experience building successful projects before. 5. It takes some money Entrepreneurial passion and energy can make you a little crazy. Caught up in the romance of working out of your garage, you may lose perspective on the very real cost of getting your app on the market. Preoccupied with funding business operations, you lose perspective on the necessary cost of developing the app effectively. But, it’s a mistake to let price drive your decision on the selection of a remote app development team. You can find the cheapest developers and they will deliver nothing. In opposite, you hire a most expensive dev team and there is no guaranty they will meet your expectations. The right way is to hire the developers with the most relevant experience. Those are professionals who have helped many companies and entrepreneurs before you. That’s whom you should hire. Once you get your app out of the gates and (hopefully) start growing the business, you can start hiring inhouse developers which takes time and effort. What can you do? In the face of challenges to your joining the Billion Dollar Startup Club, you can still realize your dream objectives. In How to Build a Billion Dollar App, George Berkowski offers 10 steps to build your app: 1. Identify a people or systems problem that applied technology can solve. 2. Find a team that understands how to design, build, and deliver the app you envision. 3. Target your business model as SaaS, iOS, or other. 4. Brand the app with some clever name that indicates its key function. 5. Build a prototype based on your storyboards and narrative. 6. Test the app to exhaustion with every possible user behavior. 7. Host a soft-launch to seek local use and immediate feedback. 8. Spread brand identity across channels and platforms. 9. Raise money. 10. Grow as market demands. But, you are not going to do this alone and, even with competent techs on board, you all have too much to do to get it right. For example, raising money takes your full-time attention. And, while you should remain significantly involved in each of these steps, it is far smarter and more cost efficient to outsource the duties you can. While ideas like yours will see the light of day thanks to your bootstrap ambition, developing your best product demands collaboration, feedback, and unique expertise. In a search for hot unicorns, Forbes contributor Karsten Strauss writes, “What we learned was that technology is transforming industries the world over and investors are backing young companies that promise to change the face of e-commerce, food tech, financial services, and the enterprise.” You could add a score of industry sectors to Strauss’ list, but the markets have plenty of room for your app development. Still, a well-selected remote app development team may be your best option to beat these five key challenges in the way of your Billion Dollar Startup Club membership.

https://medium.com/devteamspace/5-must-follow-rules-when-hiring-a-mobile-remote-dev-team-ed0a53c7f1c9?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"Outsourcing your software development offers you significant benefits, but there are risks as well. When you don’t plan for risks, you invite damage and failure. Here is how to make it right. Before you start any remote process, you must protect yourself against loss. Risk management starts with a Non-Disclosure Agreement to avoid the loss of proprietary information to a third-party company. Because there is always a possibility of meeting a team that will want to take advantage of your ideas, you should understand the benefits and demerits of outsourcing your software development as you hire vendors for your project. So, before moving on to the must-have rules of outsourcing your software development, it is worth mentioning some basic tips that will make the selection process easier for you. They can help find the right service provide, getting maximal benefits from your efforts. Choosing your remote partner · Clearly define your business objectives and goals. Specify what you want, what you expect from the provider, and what you want to achieve. Although simple, this critical activity will help ensure that you are on the right path. • Check up on the experience of your partner. This involves learning more about the technologies available, dev platforms, and other key competencies the candidate has. • Look at work samples by having the devs present works that are most related to your own project or just the best ones they can showcase. • Check devs’ communication practices. For example, by schedule an interview to ensure that communication will be effortless and easy no matter what. • Consider the developers’ overall management values and work attitudes. • Learn as much as possible about their dev process. This includes asking for information in regards to how they have set up their development process and how you can check up on progress. • Determine is the dev team ready and willing to sign NDA or IP agreement. • Confirm the responsibilities of each party in the project in terms of bug fixing, ongoing support and others. What will be free (usually bugs fixing is free) and what will you pay for. This is just a ballpark recommendations list, so you can add any particular requirements important to you and your business. Even though technology does make it easy to find remote devs, the process can still be difficult. It doesn’t matter whether you are comfortable working with an individual or a remote team, but you should be sure that you are working with the right people. In other words, you cannot rush your decision making process because this can greatly influence how your project rolls out. Your software outsource development experience will run as smoothly as possible only after your carefully consider the external and internal factors as well as the specifics of your project. The 5 Must-Have Rules to Follow Regrettably, the many misconceptions surrounding software development outsourcing have seen many businesses and entrepreneurs waste time and money they can’t afford. What you want is a software dev team that is focused on helping your business reach its full potential by building intuitive mobile apps and strong web platforms. Here are the critical rules that you should follow, in no particular order: 1. Fixed Price model — be aware. Based on the specifications you provided in the beginning of the project, the fixed price model sets a fixed budget. You pay exactly what is in the contract, no matter how much time the developers take. As you run your business, you have to watch the fast-paced software market for trends and be flexible if you want to succeed. Expect your specs to change, and they will. If you find yourself in a locked contract that offers a defined scope of work, project specs, and terms, any changes you request will have you back sitting at the price negotiation phase. This can stall progress, and if this happens frequently, it is likely to harm the relationship. A fixed price model is not suitable for startups because change happens constantly. Startups adjust direction regularly, adopting new technologies and improving rapidly, so should their end products. In addition, the fixed price model is more expensive than other models. A service provider will always look for a means of accounting for possible risks in their fixed price estimate. Since they are not familiar with your technology and niche, they will apply premiums to the known and unknown so as not to lose on the fixed price estimate. It is good to be confident about the future, but there are ways to keep calm. A good idea is to request a “test drive” for two weeks before you commit fully. Thus you spend a little and validate the dev team. 2. Be Involved For your product to succeed, it is critical that you get involved with your in-house or offshore dev team. Carry out due diligence and interview every developer you want to recruit yourself or have someone in your firm do it for you. It is important that your service provider understands your business. Proper engagement from both sides, in combination with regular communication, will get you better results. Building solutions together is what makes them masterpieces. 3. Watch out for signs of bad communication Good communication is key to the success of your project. Ensure that the provider’s project manager knows their developers well and that your in-house product owner or manager has a clear vision of what your product should achieve. These are key people in the project, so they should have open communication channels that they use frequently and properly. Communication also includes detailed and transparent reporting. Your project manager should not forget to make daily or weekly reports, or give early notification in case of missed deadlines. When you think there are no problems, it simply means that you are not aware of them. You don’t want to lose contact or leave the development unattended. If the project manager is frequently unavailable or not returning your calls, this is a sign you should notice. It may be time to change service providers. If you are getting bad signals, you cannot rely on time to make communication better — it often never does. 4. Protect your information assets When outsourcing to remote dev team, one of the biggest concerns for entrepreneurs is protecting your intellectual property. Follow these three simple rules on protecting your idea, and you can rest easy: • Make sure the Non-Disclosure Agreement is part of the contract you sign with the service provider. • Learn more about what the service provider has put in place to protect your source code and rights. This can include ensuring that all code is in a secure and safe globally accessible repository like GitLab/GitHub, and that devs use Jira, Asana or Trello for daily work on your project. • Sign an Intellectual Property Rights agreement that the source code remains your sole property. You can find this agreement as part of the main contract you sign with the service provider. • Conduct a due diligence audit on the provider to discover and confirm their best practices. 5. Keep core expertise in-house Keeping core expertise in-house is important for many businesses, especially startups. It is also true that many routine development duties that require a lot of effort have nothing to do with core expertise. As you offload some of these tasks to a third-party, you are simply saving your best in-house talent for creating more value for your efforts. However, as you develop the core parts of your product or add innovative features, a better approach would be to keep this development phase in-house. As an alternative, some businesses, struggling with the recruitment of high caliber developers locally, choose to relocate the service provider’s star developer to their offices. However, this requires setting up an appropriate agreement, some legal input, and relocation expenses. In a majority of cases, this can be a cheaper and much faster approach compared to putting together an entire team of the same quality locally. Conclusion These five must-follow rules allow business owners and entrepreneurs to develop amicable and productive relationships based on trust-building and mutual respect with an outsourcing software development company. The better you manage such relationships, the more likely you will be positioned to release better, more creative products more efficiently and quickly than before.

https://medium.com/devteamspace/why-your-company-almost-certainly-needs-a-mobile-app-and-how-to-build-it-dab1cf6dc906?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"Major players use mobile apps to increase retention and revenue. And so should you. Read below if you want to grow. There are over 75 billion app downloads occurring every year. If your start-up doesn’t already have one, it might needs one. The reality of business in today’s exceedingly competitive and global environment is that if you aren’t doing what your competitors are better than they do it, you’re far behind in the eyes of a consumer. That’s why you can’t avoid app development. But what do you do if budgets are thin and demands are high? It’s time to outsource your app development to a professional dev team and take advantage of the global community you’re trying to catch up to! Here’s a no-fail plan on how, why and what to look for when it comes to outsourcing something as vital as your business’s app. Why Your Company Almost Certainly Needs an App We get it: You might still be wondering whether your service actually needs a mobile app. Your web app/website may already be responsive and people can use it on mobile devices. However, apps serve a different purpose. Your app is an effective and quick interface for your clients and can be used for numerous other purposes not included in your website. And of them is push notifications — it can help to increase sales and user retention drastically! According to a Nielsen study, smartphone users spent 89 percent of their mobile time on mobile apps, with women spending more than an hour and a half more than men on apps. That’s an awful lot of time spent looking for your message and not receiving it if you don’t have an app, or, worse yet, your app is poorly functioning. Nevertheless, this massive amount of app time offers you an opportunity you can take advantage of and your business can become a media source on its own, offering something that is equally valuable, but different than your website. As a founder and start-up entrepreneur, the idea of having an app may not be that important to you. However, you should note that mobile penetration has risen everywhere, and it’s already old news. Your current clients and potential ones are already using mobile almost all the time and they expect to access all types of services and games on their computers via their mobile devices. It is critical that any business should look forward to integrating mobile usage to increase Key Performance Indicators (KPI) — a must-have in today’s start-up environment. Increasingly, mobile app development is becoming an integral part of many companies’ digital business strategies. A mobile app offers your brand increased sales, a greater and integrated online presence and takes your brand to the next level. Apps also offer you a direct marketing channel where you can easily interact with your clients, and they can in turn use services that simplify their daily routine. It is no wonder that the demand is creating its own supply and it is easy to predict that mobile app development is already the most popular industry. According to Statista report, mobile app revenues will drastically increase from 2015 to 2020. The figures are from spending on apps through app stores. According to the forecast, app consumers will pay out more than $50.9 billion by end of 2016 and the amount expected to increase in double figures by 2020! As part of your promotions and marketing efforts, you may have stumbled upon a great idea that can help market your services and products. Creating an app that will help strengthen your brand and keep you at the top of your clients’ minds is the smartest way to harness this. Like any other rent or buy business decision, you’ve got a lot to consider before executing on the creation and that’s exactly why you should consider letting a third-party dev team build an app for you. In-House Versus Outsourcing App Development In-house mobile app development is a complex process that involves a lot of cash and time prior to the product launch. You need to work on hiring developers, providing them with workplaces and equipment, defining the scope of their duties, and many other tasks that you wouldn’t even possibly foresee no matter how well planned you are. However, if you feel you don’t have the infrastructure in your start-up (even large companies often don’t), or you just want to save money and spend less time, outsourcing is the way to go. There are three types of involvement when it comes to dealing with third-party devs: · Onshore means you hire developers in your home country · Nearshore involves hiring developers in a near country, but on the same continent/time zone · Offshore means you hire devs from a country with a substantial time zone difference Nearshore and onshore developers are most expensive options.From another side — there are no restrictions for firms looking to hire offshore developers since modern technology and services make such cooperation more convenient than was ever possible. So you have a great chance to find outstanding offshore devteam and get things done with a reasonable budget! Benefits of Outsourcing Mobile App Development The truth about outsourcing your app development to a third-party dev team is that it is just a more economical and viable option than creating your own in-house team. Want more proof? 1. Experience of the service provider: Outsourcing app development to professional dev team means you get to benefit from their expertise and knowledge. Hiring a third-party app developer means you are hiring expertise that crosses the border to even those not related to programming. You will also benefit from tips on how your apps can be properly designed, or even how to market them. Such service providers already have the necessary tools and technologies across multiple platforms to create your app. 2. Innovative solutions: professional app dev teams are experts in mobile app development and have 100x of finished projects under their belt. They can offer you innovative solutions that work best for your application. They are usually ahead of the curve on industry trends and stay abreast with the latest in technologies. Only such innovators can give your business that extra edge over your competition to be successful in modern market conditions. 3. Focus on your core business: The more your company does, the more efforts you as a founder dissipate. A trusted external dev team allows you to focus on core business objectives. This is also part of the key benefits of outsourcing your app development. You have more time for your main activities, as well as any other interests while the appointed team implements your ideas. Who said you can’t have a work-life balance and change the world? 4. Save time: Time efficiency is a critical part in any successful project. Many start-ups choose outsourcing to have their products developed faster and cost-effectively. The less time you are spending on development, the faster you can launch your app to the market. For modern companies, the lean methodology holds true in this case as you aim for your business to be more efficient and eliminate waste at every possible angle. 5. Save money: This is the single most critical advantage of outsourcing. Many founding business owners and entrepreneurs are actively seeking mobile app devs who provide affordable services that local talent simply can’t offer. But it’s not just about saving money. If you’ve selected a right partner, you’ll get to save money and still work with world class developers. How to Mitigate the Risks of Outsourcing App Development Choosing a third-party company to develop your mobile app is not the same as choosing a partner for a week or two. It is more about choosing a software vendor that will become an extended form of your team for a long period. Like any other business relationship, there is always some risk that you should be aware of and be prepared for when outsourcing your app development. Here are some potential pitfalls that await entrepreneurs and businesses when they choose to outsource app development so you don’t make them. · Set clear and realistic goals for your app: It is easier to achieve what you want when you have goals. Establishing what you want your app to do and what your clients will get from it are the minimum to help you get started with your outsourcing provider. With a goal in place, your app development becomes that much easier. · Two-way communication: If devs aren’t reporting back regularly and they don’t discuss potential issues or threats, it just means they are having a hard time saying no or simply aren’t plugged into your project or vision. Make sure that your remote dev team takes the appropriate time to discuss potential problems. One way to do this is by having them communicate with you through collaboration tools like Bitbucket, Basecamp, Trello, Github, Pivotal Tracker, Confluence or Jira. · A well thought out contract: Contracts outline the specifics in terms of creative, payment, expectations, roles, cooperation strategy and other rights. Have a lawyer review this critical document before you sign it. The contract should provide you with safe options to terminate the agreement in case your service provider does not meet quality expectations. Remember to set a date for the renewal of the contract so you can consider whether to continue or not. A professionally done contract is your best guarantee that your ideas are protected against plagiarism. Ultimately, you need to choose a team based on quality, not price. Be in constant communication and do thorough interviews and research as the first step. When you find a potential app developer, start by having them create a quality prototype or ask to complete a simple 1–2 weeks task. It’s the best way to ensure that they do follow industry best practices and they have competent devs with proven work processes. Conclusion You might think that having an app for your start-up is just one more thing to worry about, but the benefits you stand to gain are huge. Once you start its development, experiment it and get it out into the market, you will be pleasantly surprised by how your clients respond. But before you get to see it impact on your business, you need to make the right choices when it comes to developing that app. Outsourcing your app development is the best way to save on costs and stress, all while ensuring your vision is met. Just be sure to follow the advice in this article on how to pick a developer and what to look for and you’ll be well on your way to having a great app for a fraction of the price and anxiety in no time!

https://medium.com/devteamspace/coursera-is-removing-software-development-courses-and-hundreds-of-others-c243d1a09c04?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"At DevTeam.Space, we care deeply about software development quality and opportunities for new talented developers to rise. So we are really sorry to learn that one of the largest online education course sites, Coursera, is shutting down their old platform. They will close access to some of their software development courses and hundreds of others. Use this guide to get them while you still can. This guide is prepared with a help of our friends at Class Central. Coursera has been working on a new platform since 2014. It has been built in order to accommodate their ‘On Demand’ courses. While the old platform housed these courses, it did so without any fixed schedule and timing was largely based on the professors’ discretion. This resulted in a lot of courses being discovered too late for enrollment. To fix that, our friends at Class Central have built the MOOC Tracker. The tracker served as the main source of information by allowing those who were tracking a course in Class Central to receive a notification for new course sessions. On June 30, 2016, Coursera will be shutting down the old platform and some course materials may no longer be available on the new one. Some ‘On Demand’ courses have already moved to their new home and it’s expected that more will be moved over as the date nears. However, there will be courses that will no longer be available on the new platform. The following highly-rated courses will no longer be available on the new platform: There are currently more than 1500 courses on Coursera and over 450 of them are still using the old platform. Any of these 450 courses (see the list here) may soon be unavailable for you. If the course is still open for enrolment, the enrolment button on the right means that it is still using the old platform, while an enrolment button on the left indicates that the course can be found in the new platform. There are only 220 courses out of the 450 that are still available for enrolment. You can check your courses on this list here. How to Download Course Materials from the Old Platform Step #1: Find Your Course(s)Before proceeding, determine the courses that you are after and find them on Coursera. Proceed to the chosen course’s page that should be similar to this, https://class.coursera.org/pgm-003/lecture. The following will help you find the course(s) that are available for download. Note that you may still add the courses from the old platform to the MOCC Tracker so that we can notify you if the course moves to the new platform. For those who are already enrolled in the course: For those who are not enrolled in the course: Step #2: Download All Course MaterialsBefore proceeding to this step, make sure you have the link to the course materials page (See Step 1) and sufficient space in your hard drive. The following guidelines will help you download all the course materials you need. Using Google Chrome Plugin: Using Python Script (This is a bit more technical, but if you can manage it, it is the better option): You need to hurry. Make sure to download all necessary materials before June 30th, 2016. If you liked the post, click the 💚 below so other people will see it here on Medium. "
https://medium.com/devteamspace/minimize-the-risk-of-software-outsourcing-by-following-these-five-rules-8994a16df83a?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"The world of software outsourcing is huge but fraught with problems. In 2014 Information Week surveyed businesses about their use of outsourcing the development of software. Only 12% indicated that IT was satisfied with the outcome, and only 11% of their end users would rate the outsourced software as “excellent.” Outsourcing is here to stay, however. But if so many companies are dissatisfied with outsourcing, how can you end up in the lucky 11%? The major problem facing many companies considering outsourcing their software development is that they feel it is too risky. According to the same Information Week report, among the reasons that companies are often reluctant to outsource their software we find complaints such as the vendors they have to choose from seeming small and unstable, and a lack of confidence on the part of the company when it comes to negotiating contracts with vendors. Outsourcing to large vendors doesn’t always work, either. Whereas small dev teams can sometimes provide higher quality and rapid execution, large vendors often fail in this same area. Thus, outsourcing remains an unsolved puzzle for many companies: do you take a risk with small, unstable vendors, or go with large vendors that might not be able to provide the same quality and speed? Here are some of the top problems growing startups and enterprise companies face when they hire outsourcers: In 99% of cases, you can avoid these very problems if you follow five simple rules for hiring and managing your outsourcing developers. Even by implementing some of them, you will significantly reduce your risk, improve the results, and get closer to being a part of that lucky 11 %. Here they are, in no particular order: No matter what outsourcing developers you hire, be sure to follow these standards. Or at least some of them.

https://medium.com/devteamspace/the-ultimate-guide-to-successful-app-development-48c243cf05fb?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"There are millions of apps in the app store, but less than 1% of those ever make it to the top. No one can guarantee your app will be one of them, but after managing over 1000 app development processes, we think we found a pattern. Below you’ll find a detailed analysis of the main characteristics of a successful app. If you’ll have any questions after reading the article, be sure to leave a comment below, or send us an email. So let’s jump right in: The Only 3 Things That Matter For an app to be successful, whether it’s built for internal use or for the masses, it has to have all of the following traits: Now, before you go all “Duh, Einstein!” on us, just keep reading and you’ll see how we go deep into all those points to help you make sure you’re on the right track. First of all, you can imagine the first two as multipliers of each other. If you grade your idea as a 7 and your dev team as a 6, then your app has a 42% success rate. (Not so reassuring if you spend 6 figures on development and promotion, right?) On the other hand, small improvements on either side increase your chances significantly. For example, if you follow the advice below to come up with a great idea (9) and find a great team (9), then your app has almost twice the chance to succeed (81%). A very successful and still booming example of this is the private driver on-demand service, Uber. Founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with a great idea of using software to improve the taxi system and invested $200,000 into building the pilot app. Of course, your app does not need to be as disruptive as Uber, which now has hundreds of millions of users worldwide. The success of app development projects is measured in ROI. If your app reels in the results you want, that’s perfect. Part One: The Idea A natural question to ask now is: How do I know if MY idea is good enough? Well, in most cases, you should try answering the following two questions in detail: Both of those have to get affirmative and compelling answers. If one of them isn’t so compelling, then you might want to rethink it or ask your target audience about what they want. A clear example of how this works is the messaging app, Telegram. The app itself is beautiful and does exactly what it should, so the dev team did their job well. The idea itself is great also, but its fatal flaw is that it complicates people’s lives. Why? Because everyone is already using Whatsapp. And if they’re not on Whatsapp, then they’re on Snapchat, Facebook, WeChat, or any other messenger. It’s simply too much of a hassle to convince all of your friends to start using a new app, just because you think it looks better. Of course, there are also grades and levels to everything. For example, there are many people that enjoy the features of 30/30, an iOS app that allows you to create and follow on-demand routines. The idea works superbly well in many situations, but the app’s interface is way outdated. If a team would come along and take that idea, but use today’s UI/UX standards, the app has a BIG chance of becoming the next Editor’s Choice on the app store (and in many other lists, such as Product Hunt). One Exception: Games 95% of all the app ideas you can think of adhering to the above rule. Games, on the other hand, are a bit different. They don’t need to solve a problem, nor make life easier. The only question you should ask before making a game is: Is it addictive enough? We’ve seen it happen time and time again — large brands with huge budgets getting taken over by a small team of developers that created a super addictive game. If people pull out their phones every once in a while just to play your game, then you know you have a winner. Needless to say, if you start gaining a small fortune from your app, you should re-invest most of the money back into improving the game. Otherwise, the big guys will just develop something similar and, before you know it, you’re out. How To Come Up With An Idea? If you already have an idea that got compelling answers to the previous questions, you can skip this section and go to the next one. If not, keep reading. Tactic One: As hard-working professionals, we deal with a variety of obstacles on a regular basis. We should always remember that our problems are never singular. More so, there are probably thousands, if not millions of others that deal with issues similar to yours. So the main question to ask here is: What annoys you? How often does it annoy you? Can you find a solution on the market? Let me give you two examples here of how to go about it: I decided to ask one of my best friends, Google, “when’s the best time to buy airline tickets”? The very first organic result I got was from CheapAir.com — an agency that tracked 1.5 billion fares during an entire year. They determined that the best time to buy a ticket was 47 days before the flight. This was a good start because now I knew that the best prices are about 1.5 months before. But I would have still preferred specific data for my flights, automatic reminders, and a few other features. Sure enough, lower on the same page was Hopper, a mobile app that does exactly what I want, completely free of charge. Though I wasn’t successful in finding an app idea, at least I found a great app that saves me $$$ every time I travel. *pats self on back* Same as before, I did some research and came across Pete Egoscue’s book “Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain,” which also helps you strengthen your entire body and prevent pain. Among many other useful things, the book talks about a few exercise routines you can do in just 15–20 minutes. The problem? All the exercises have to be done for specific time periods, and there isn’t any “Egoscue Exercise Timer” app to be found. This is a great opportunity for anyone that wants to make an app because you’re looking at a market of millions of Egoscue practitioners from all around the world. None of them have an app that is specifically developed for that purpose. Tactic Two: OK, now you know how to find great ideas for things that annoy you. What happens if you find an app each time? You move on to the next question: What are you passionate about? Spotify came out for music lovers all over the world. Netflix came out of nowhere for everyone that loves spending countless hours watching TV series. Omvana for meditating, Duolingo for language learning, and the list goes on. Our team, for example, is very passionate about effectively building great software remotely, with less amount of risk and the best quality/price ratio. We didn’t find any platform that had all of the features we knew were essential for the optimal flow of a development project, so we decided to build one. That’s how DevTem.Space was born. Think of anything you’re really passionate about and start from there. Tactic Three: If none of the above tactics worked, then it’s time to ask for help. Start browsing the web for communities of your interest and ask them the questions you asked yourself. You can ask your friends on Facebook: “What’s something that annoys you often?” Or ask similar questions on sites like Reddit or Quora. How To Validate An Idea? Whether you used the above methods to come up with an idea, or you had one before you started reading this article, we recommend you make sure it’s validated. To help you out, we’ll share case studies of how 2 great app ideas were validated: “I wanted to find 10 people who would be willing to pay a specific amount for the product once it was complete. This forced me to not think about features, but to distill the idea down into its core value[: a] single reason someone would be willing to pay me for the product. I took that, and emailed 17 people I know, or had at least heard of, who may have shared the same pain. This way, I not only had my initial customers who could provide me feedback on the details of how Drip should work, I had the start of an early base of revenue I could use to start growing the product.” “We ‘validated’ our first (failed) product by having friends and family tell us how wonderful it was. [It] felt great, but they didn’t use it. When we started Tailwind, we took a different approach — asking complete strangers who didn’t care about us at all to [sign up] and pay before our product was even built. We stood up a signup page, bought some AdWords traffic and people actually started offering to pay us! We didn’t actually charge them, but we learned we were onto something.” As you can see, the process of validation not only helps you decide whether or not you have a great idea but also provides you with critical feedback and an initial customer pool that will invest in your app once it’s done. After you found and validated your idea, it’s time to go into… Part 2: The Development Process Here it’s less about you and more about the process itself. There are hundreds of best case practices within the software development industry, but it’s not your job to know them. The people you decide to work with should know exactly what they need to do. Our internet provider does not ask us what’s the best way to install a router, nor should your dev team ask you how to build an app. You should always have direct contact with the team that’s building your app, and a project manager that’s overseeing everything and can step in whenever needed. Avoid hiring a freelancer, especially if what you’re building is of significant importance to you, or takes several months to finish. A single person can rarely match the output, timelines, and consistency of an experienced team. Also, note that choosing a team based on your specific needs is critical for the success of this phase. We can help you with that later, but for now, we’ll share with you a few important considerations — no matter who you work with. Software developers can build almost anything (if the budget is there), and also provide useful insights and feedback at the right moments. But at the end of the day, it’s your responsibility to know what you want. We recommend you have a place online (such as a shared document) where you have all of the project specs and requirements. This doc should be regularly revised and updated after each conversation you have with your dev team. Avoid “just talking about it.” Have everything written down. Presume nothing, explain everything. But don’t worry, you do not need to have all the details at the first meeting. Instead, make sure you insist on the next point. Before the first lines of code are written, be sure to agree with your team on a strict system of communications. This will allow you to keep track of their progress, and also ask questions or make comments whenever you remember something. We highly recommend asking your team to provide daily reports. A week is just too much time to wait and hope everything’s going according to plan. Small, daily reports, on the other hand, keep the team accountable (and keep you informed). Make sure the team you choose has systems and processes in place for testing everything they build. From a developer’s standpoint, this usually comes with experience. The more similar projects they worked on, the more they know what to look for. You should also thoroughly test everything they send you and provide constructive feedback when you notice something. Again, don’t assume anything. It’s better to ask and be sure than to hope. Lastly, we gave you a hint of this before, but it’s very important so we’ll mention it again. Great software is never really “done.” There’s always something to add or improve. Focus on getting an initial version with core features into the hand of some people from within your target market as fast as you can. Ask them to describe their experience and use their feedback to improve your app. OK. Now that you had a great idea and built an equally great app around it, it’s time for the last step. Part 3: Sales & Marketing After building a great app, you should take full responsibility for promoting it as best as you can (or for hiring some experts to do it for you). Though we don’t offer app promotion, we’ve seen some great initiatives from the people we worked with. Such initiatives helped their app rank in the top charts for both the iOS and Android stores. These are a few of the strategies they used: 1. Build a microsite. Use specific keywords and phrases so people searching on Google can find you. You can also have a blog section for the extra SEO juice. (Hint: This only works if you’re constantly publishing new articles) 2. Create a short demo video. This is a simple, powerful, yet highly unused strategy. You should put the video everywhere you can and share it whenever you get the chance. For the video itself to be great, make sure it’s short and tells a story, much like Wunderlist or Dropbox. This helps the viewer see how their lives would be better if they would use your app. 3. Share on social media. Tag friends and ask them to share and download it if they like it. Do this at least once every 2 weeks — each time tag different people. It also helps to do research, learn about, and join communities on various social media platforms. Just remember that advertising your app will probably get you kicked out. It’s much better to get conversations going on topics such as “What could I do to improve my app?” 4. Email friends & family. A study conducted by ExactTarget found that “91% of people check their email daily”. Be sure to have a list ready even before the launch. Also, if you added social sharing capabilities within your app, it’s a good idea to ask (and remind) those people to use them. 5. Offer a discounted price at launch. Or make it free of charge for X days/weeks. Just be sure to write a “FREE ONLY FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS” line at the top of the description. This will also allow you to reach out to blogs, subreddits, forums, and Facebook groups that are actively looking for and testing free/discounted apps. 6. Resolve negative feedback asap. Keep an eye on the reviews section and make fixing issues or adding improvements your #1 priority. After you do, make a habit of reaching out to the people that gave you feedback to thank and give them the good news. 7. (Extra) If you’ve invested a 6–7 figure sum into your app, then it might be worth reaching out to review sites (like AppAdvice.com or AppStoreApps.com) and to journalists from within your niche. One of the best online marketers in the world, Neil Patel, states that “Press is the best way to kick start your startup, and the best way to get it is to manually reach out to journalists.” If you liked the post, click the💚 below so other people will see it here on Medium.

https://medium.com/devteamspace/what-we-learned-from-1-000-development-projects-26dc0338aaa7?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"For most businesses, having an in-house development team is simply not an option. You already have dozens of responsibilities on your plate. Having an extra five to ten developers in your company means more salaries, more time lost in management, and more stress. This is exactly why businesses of all sizes and in all industries decide to outsource their app’s design and development to ready-made teams with experience. This process of delegation lowers costs, shortens the time from concept to launch, and allows you to continue focusing on core business activities. Both remote software development teams and the mass of businesses that employ them have exponentially increased in number. The vast majority of software today is developed via outsourcing, and we believe the ratio will continue to grow in their favor. Of course, this movement brings with it many challenges. The two main ones are: Today we would like to offer you an overview of what you can do, as an app owner, to assure that your app’s development process is as smooth as can be. Eliminate as Much Doubt as Possible From the very beginning, be very clear and very blunt. The rule here is to avoid presumptions. Don’t presume the devs know what you want or how you want it. Here are a few points of advice to help you eliminate doubt: Ways to Keep in Touch Professionals are not robots. They’re regular people, just like you and me. As a result — It is best to avoid having long, back-and-forth emails conversations — no one likes them. Use email only to discuss less important or less time-sensitive issues. Instead, use other, more effective means of communication. You can use sharable documents, to-do lists, instant messaging, chat rooms, video conferences, phone calls, and a variety of other tools. Let me give you a few examples of what each of these mediums can be used for: Important note: Effective communication is always two-ways. You cannot expect your team to know what you’re thinking, so be proactive about offering constructive feedback and asking questions as often as you can. Have a Separate Account/Project Manager (PM) It is critical to have someone in charge of managing the development process and keeping all stakeholders in the loop. Many times, both these roles can be handled by one person. Someone which has a technical background and is also skilled in effective communication. The PM has to understand technical terms and be able to translate them into plain English. And this goes both ways. All of your requirements and feedback have to be broken apart into small modules and tasks for the devs to work on. A PM knows and uses all of the points outlined within this article. An effective PM is invisible during most of the development process. You talk and give feedback directly to the devs, which are the ones responsible for providing you with daily reports. Project managers hop in only to when needed, to clarify or solve certain situations. Use Version Control Systems Make sure the dev team uses systems such as Github or Bitbucket and request an invitation to the project’s branch. This will allow you to see all of the changes that are being made to your app’s source code. This point is extremely useful for tech-savvy co-founders who understand everything that’s going on. On the other hand, if you are not familiar with the code, the PM has your back. In either case, we recommend that you insist on the use of versioning systems, even if there will be just one person working on the code for your app. Regular Pulse Checks Most software development projects take several months to complete. Don’t expect everything to go as planned and don’t wait until the last month to check on progress. Together with your project manager, decide on a system of communication. We recommend daily written reports and weekly calls. Remember: It’s not that you don’t trust your team. You just don’t want to take any chances. At the end of the day, this is better for both sides. Trust Your Gut Feeling If you have doubts or simply don’t understand certain aspects of the development process: ask. No one expects you to understand everything. You’re hiring a team of experts for a reason. If you pay them well, it is their duty to both deliver a finished product and keep you informed throughout the entire process. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is ignoring the small, silent voices that pop up in your mind. State your observations as soon as they arise. This will help you avoid any unpleasant surprises down the road. Avoid Micro-Management Set up a clear system of communication and then trust the process. If you’ve picked your dev team well enough, then they know what they’re doing. There is no need for you, or anyone else, to disturb them. As discussed in previous points, there are tens of tools and systems that help you keep track, on a daily basis, of everything that’s being done on your project. Avoid interrupting your team for the sake of conversation. Let them do the work and engage with them only at scheduled meetings. Taking into consideration all of the above points will almost guarantee your app will be ready on time, within the specified budget, and with the least bit of obstacles.

https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/hack-the-planet-a208f5fa98f3?source=collection_home---------7----------------------------,"The program has undefined behavior! But it might display the following output: The variable id in function restrictedTask2 has not been initialized and has an indeterminate value. To use its value is undefined behavior. Anything can happen when a program runs into undefined behavior; the C++ standard makes no guarantees. Even the part of the program that happened before we took id’s value is undefined! However, if you run this program on your own computer, it will probably print both did task 1 and did task 2, at least if you compile without optimizations. So the value 1337 magically teleported from restrictedTask1 to restrictedTask2! How could this happen? Most systems use a stack for local variables. restrictedTask1 has a local variable id, which it sets aside space for in its stack frame. As it happens, restrictedTask2 has the same number and types of local variables (one int), so its stack frame layout will be identical to restrictedTask1’s. When in main, the stack will have grown to a certain point, see the leftmost illustration in the following figure. We then call restrictedTask1, the stack grows, restrictedTask1 sets aside space in its stack frame for id, and initializes id to 1337. Then, control returns to main and the stack shrinks again. Next, we call restrictedTask2, the stack grows again, restrictedTask2 sets aside space in its stack frame for id, but does not initialize it. However, restrictedTask2’s stack frame ends up in the exact same place as restrictedTask1’s stack frame. The stack is not cleared between function calls, so the contents of restrictedTask2’s stack frame will be exactly as restrictedTask1 left it, including the value 1337 in the position of the local variable id. This causes 1337 to be printed in both functions. If you turn on optimizations, however, restrictedTask1() and restrictedTask2() are likely to be inlined into main, and the stack is not used for these calls. You can try this yourself by compiling with -O2 (GCC/Clang) or /O2 (MSVC). On my x86_64 Linux machine, GCC prints did task 1 with -O2, whereas Clang seg- faults. What happens on your machine? To avoid nasal demons, security holes like this one, and garbage data in general, you should always initialize your variables before using them. It is easy to slip up, but there is help to be had! First of all, always compile with warnings. Both GCC, Clang, and MSVC will warn you about this particular case, as will tools like clang-tidy. But that is only because it is straightforward to prove that id is uninitialized when it is used. Often, we can’t know this until run-time. This is where sanitizers come in. Different sanitizers exist for different purposes, but they all monitor your code at run-time in various ways to detect problems that can’t be detected at compile time. One such sanitizer is MemorySanitizer, which is designed to catch usages of uninitialized memory. If we run this program with MemorySanitizer (pass -fsanitize=memory as a compiler option to Clang), it will print some- thing like this: It tells you that you’re using uninitialized memory and gives you a stack trace to where it happened. Sanitizers can make your program much slower, so you typically want separate build configurations with sanitizers. A sanitizer can detect an issue only if that issue actually occurs at runtime, though, so make sure to run as much of your test suite as possible with this build.

https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/why-algorithms-matter-45e6742decea?source=collection_home---------8----------------------------,"In the previous chapter, we took a look at our first data structures and saw how choosing the right data structure can affect the performance of our code. Even two data structures that seem so similar, such as the array and the set, can have very different levels of efficiency. In this chapter, we’re going to discover that even if we decide on a particular data structure, another major factor can affect the efficiency of our code: the proper selection of which algorithm to use. Although the word algorithm sounds like something complex, it really isn’t. An algorithm is simply a set of instructions for completing a specific task. Even a process as simple as preparing a bowl of cereal is technically an algorithm, as it involves following a defined set of steps to achieve the task at hand. The cereal-preparation algorithm follows these four steps (for me, at least): 1. Grab a bowl. 2. Pour cereal into the bowl. 3. Pour milk into the bowl. 4. Dip a spoon into the bowl. When applied to computing, an algorithm refers to the set of instructions given to a computer to achieve a particular task. When we write any code, then, we’re creating algorithms for the computer to follow and execute. We can also express algorithms using plain English to set out the details of the instructions we plan on providing the computer. Throughout this book, I’ll use both plain English as well as code to show how various algorithms work. Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the same task. We saw an example of this at the beginning of Chapter 1, Why Data Structures Matter, where we had two different approaches for printing out even numbers. In that case, one algorithm had twice as many steps as the other. In this chapter, we’ll encounter another two algorithms that solve the same problem. In this case, though, one algorithm will be faster than the other by orders of magnitude. To explore these new algorithms, we’ll need to take a look at a new data structure. The ordered array is almost identical to the “classic” array we saw in the previous chapter. The only difference is that ordered arrays require that the values are always kept — you guessed it — in order. That is, every time a value is added, it gets placed in the proper cell so that the values in the array remain sorted. For example, let’s take the array [3, 17, 80, 202]: Assume we want to insert the value 75 into the array. If this array were a classic array, we could insert the 75 at the end, as follows: As we saw in the previous chapter, the computer can accomplish this in a single step. On the other hand, if this were an ordered array, we’d have no choice but to insert the 75 in the proper spot so that the values remain in ascending order: Now, this is easier said than done. The computer cannot simply drop the 75 into the right slot in a single step because it first has to find the right place to insert the 75, and then shift the other values to make room for it. Let’s break down this process step by step. Let’s start again with our original ordered array: Step 1: We check the value at index 0 to determine whether the value we want to insert — the 75 — should go to its left or to its right: Because 75 is greater than 3, we know that the 75 will be inserted somewhere to its right. However, we don’t know yet exactly which cell it should be inserted into, so we need to check the next cell. We’ll call this type of step a comparison, where we compare the value we’re inserting to a number already present in the ordered array. Step 2: We inspect the value at the next cell: 75 is greater than 17, so we need to move on. Step 3: We check the value at the next cell: We’ve encountered the value 80, which is greater than the 75 we wish to insert. Since we’ve reached the first value that is greater than 75, we can conclude that the 75 must be placed immediately to the left of this 80 to maintain the order of this ordered array. To do this, we need to shift data to make room for the 75. Step 4: Move the final value to the right: Step 5: Move the next-to-last value to the right: Step 6: We can finally insert the 75 into its correct spot: It emerges that when inserting into an ordered array, we need to always conduct a search before the actual insertion to determine the correct spot for the insertion. This is one difference in performance between a classic array and an ordered array. We can see in this example that there were initially four elements, and that insertion took six steps. In terms of N, we’d say that for N elements in an ordered array, the insertion took N + 2 steps in total. Interestingly, the number of steps for insertion remains similar no matter where in the ordered array our new value ends up. If our value ends up toward the beginning of the ordered array, we have fewer comparisons and more shifts. If our value ends up toward the end, we get more comparisons but fewer shifts. The fewest steps occur when the new value winds up at the very end, since no shifts are necessary. In this case, we take N steps to compare the new value with all N existing values, plus one step for the insertion itself, yielding a total of N + 1 steps. While insertion is less efficient for an ordered array than for a classic array, the ordered array has a secret superpower when it comes to searching. "

My friend Brooke responded without a second of hesitation, “Oh God, I would kill myself.” And she meant it. Brooke had been in an abusive marriage for over 28 years. She recalls how she almost walked away the night before the wedding. But everyone had traveled from all over the world to be there. She didn’t want to let people down. So, she walked down the aisle. Over the years, she had threatened to leave her husband multiple times. She would get in the car and start driving. But she was unable to leave the three beautiful sons they had together. So, a few hours later, she would always turn back around. She always had an excuse, there was always a “later.” But she knew the real reason she couldn’t walk away. It wasn’t the children, financial security, or even what people thought. “I don’t think I’m strong enough to go through what it takes to leave him,” she says quietly. “It’s true that it will suck. Your children may not understand. Your mutual friends may choose his side. You may lose your house and your savings in the divorce. In fact, there is almost no guarantee of anything. But if you stay, there is a guarantee that the next six years will be just as bad as the last six,” I said. A heavy silence descended as she realized what she had to do. Irrespective of how much she didn’t want to. She knew that she would have to go through it. Delaying it would only mean she had more years of suffering before ultimately having to take the step anyway. And what about you, dear reader? How would you feel if you continued down the path you’re on for the next six years? Perhaps your rut isn’t as intense as Brooke’s. Maybe you just feel like you lack purpose, are stagnated in your… "

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

But that’s dead wrong… Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to respond to them in a healthy way. For example: Of course, it’s hard work to cultivate a healthier relationship with your emotions — one that allows you to be resilient and strong in the face of painful feelings instead of fragile. But it is possible. And the most effective way to do it is to build consistent habits that promote a more tolerant and accepting relationship with all your feelings — even the painful ones. If you want to become emotionally strong, work to cultivate these 4 habits. Like anything painful, our automatic response to difficult emotions is to try and control them — usually in an attempt to escape them or “fix” them. And this tendency to control makes sense given how good at exerting control we are in most areas of life: In many areas of our life, it’s helpful and productive to exert control over our problems. But here’s the thing… Emotions aren’t under our direct control. Go ahead and try it: Of course, these are ridiculous experiments to run because you don’t have a happiness dial you can just adjust at will. Or an anxiety button you can just turn on and off. You can only control your emotions indirectly, primarily through how you choose to think and what you choose to pay attention to. For example: When you try to control things you don’t have control over — like your feelings — you’ll only create more pain and suffering for yourself in the long run. Emotionally strong people take control over their attention and what they choose to focus on. Instead of letting their mind bounce around according to the whims of instinct, they practice holding their attention on what matters and avoid getting sucked into unhelpful thought patterns like rumination or worry. If you want to be more emotionally strong, validate your emotions and control your attention. Most people associate emotional strength with toughness and being hard on themselves. This makes sense because as children this is what most of us learned: That if you wanted to be strong — a strong student, a strong athlete, a strong musician — you had to be strict and hard on yourself in order to achieve. Unfortunately, this toughness approach doesn’t work real well with difficult emotions. And in fact, the harder you are on yourself for feeling bad, the worse you’ll end up feeling. For example: Here’s the bigger point: When you respond to painful emotions with negative self-talk, you train your brain to be ashamed of feeling bad. Emotionally strong people realize that it’s actually much more helpful to be compassionate and understanding with yourself when you feel bad. In other words, they practice compassionate self-talk. Now, if that sounds a little woo-woo or new-agey, it’s not at all. Self-compassion simply means applying the same standard of kindness and support that you would give to a friend who was struggling to yourself. For example: True emotional strength comes from gentleness, not criticism. Emotionally strong people listen to their emotions but never take orders from them. Unfortunately, our cultural attitude toward emotions tends to be one of extremes… Most people see emotions either as silly and to be ignored or gotten rid of or that they are quasi-mystical experiences guiding us toward truth and ultimate enlightenment. In reality, emotions are much more mundane. They’re a survival mechanism that adapted over hundreds of thousands of years. And while they’re quite useful in some situations, they’re just as often unhelpful in others. For example: The point is simply this: Your emotions will lead you astray just as often as they will guide you. Emotionally strong people know that in the face of difficult decisions, it’s best to listen to their emotions. But ultimately, they use their values and reason to guide their decisions, not the emotional whims of the moment. Think about it: Listen to all your emotions but don’t blindly take orders from them. Emotionally strong people are able to resist the pull of unhelpful emotions because they’ve spent time discovering and clarifying their values. As a result, they’re able to make decisions that are good for them in the long-term rather than just impulsively acting on whatever feels easy in the moment. It’s hard to set and enforce healthy boundaries… But it’s even harder to live without good boundaries… Emotionally strong people know that you can’t be emotionally healthy if you never stand up for yourself and your own wants and needs. Unfortunately, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries is a classic short-term/long-term problem: Like eating a healthy diet, studying in school, or investing your money instead of spending it wastefully, what feels easy in the short-term doesn’t usually lead to great results in the long run. And what feels difficult in the short term often leads to much better outcomes in the end. So too with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries… But here’s the thing… Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Saying no to an overbearing manager or manipulative family member feels bad in the moment. But don’t mistake the fact that it feels bad for whether it’s a good decision or not. If you want to become more emotionally strong, practice communicating your wants and needs assertively and having the courage to set (and enforce) healthy boundaries.

What I’m saying is no man is born to be an island and you’ll need people at some point in your life. You’ll need people to put you through, guide you, and show you directions. Let me use myself as an example. About three years ago, when I was still studying at my undergraduate level, I was given a very small project to work on and I decided that you know what I’m going to test this saying out and see how well I perform in the end, so I told no one about the project. Of course, I did my research on the project, and I went online to get guidance and I was pretty confident that it would turn out to be a really wonderful project. The day came for me to present my work and when I got up to begin my presentation, a lot of my friends and even the people around me, I would say, were a bit shocked to find out that I was given the project to work on and didn’t mention anything about it because it was quite a huge deal. I could hear whispers of *why didn’t she tell us* but what’s done is done and I was going to present it. As I began my presentation, I wasn’t confident and bold enough to speak well, my body language was giving a totally different message, I rushed everything and a presentation that was supposed to take 45 minutes of simple and clear explanation was done in under 15 minutes. The lecturers were not happy, and as a matter of fact, if I could translate the expression on their faces into words, it would be, *we should have given it to somebody else. After I was done with the presentation, a friend of mine came over and asked, “why didn’t you tell us and then we would have helped you or guided you on how to do it"". I couldn’t say a word because I thought I was doing the right thing, but my performance and judgment of the whole situation was below average and underwhelming. In all fairness, I would have asked somebody to show me how to do it. What did I learn from that experience? It is this, if you don’t know how to do something, reach out to people who can help you and don’t rely on yourself thinking that you can do a great job. ""Stop revealing your plans to people"" I don’t think I understand this thing well enough or maybe I apply it in the wrong situations. I even read books on really successful people in life and they say the same thing too, but I don’t understand what they mean. I’m still struggling to come to terms with what the saying truly means and how to apply it. If you can help me with a clearer understanding, I would really appreciate it because lately I’ve been going through tough challenges and, in all honesty, I need help. So do I agree with the saying? Not entirely. I feel like if you need help with your plans, you should reach out to people who know better and have pure intentions. "

Good looking. Financially well-off. Reasonably center-left leaning. Over six feet tall. Personality with a great sense of humor. The whole kit and caboodle. The only caveat is he’s now middle-aged and, despite dating many women, he hasn’t been able to find one worth marrying. Last time we spoke about the topic, he broke it down for me like this: Are women in their 30s really the “leftovers”? The ones who didn’t get snatched up in their 20s because, for one reason or another, they weren't marriage material? I would certainly like to think not. But whenever I speak to men, there tends to be a stigma about women in this age group. “Women in their 30s are entitled and set in their ways.” “They already had their fun around town and bring tons of baggage into any new relationship.” “They’re desperate and in a rush to find someone before they age out of the dating market.” Ouch. Things like pursuing an education or focusing on one’s career could result in taking time away from dating. Women in these categories are not necessarily running around town with tons of men, or suffering through one fractured relationshipship after another. But men still may not find them attractive, because women who pursue education and career above all else are often seen as masculine. Truly, truly, we can’t win. "

Recognizing when one is being genuine and when one is leveraging your emotions for their gain can be a subtle art, painted across the canvas of interactions, feelings, and behaviors. In this exploration, we seek to delve into FIVE behaviors that may hint at a man utilizing a woman’s emotions, empathy, or resources for his own benefit. Our journey here is not to castigate, but to empower women to recognize, navigate through, and protect themselves against such maneuvers, ensuring that their voyage towards love is respectful, reciprocal, and healthy. The exhilaration of new connections often brings along a kaleidoscope of emotions, where every conversation seems mystic and every moment spent is cherished. Amidst this, it becomes paramount to observe clarity and commitment in interactions and intentions. Imagine this: your conversations are deep, sometimes flirting with future possibilities, yet when it comes to defining the relationship or planning tangible futures, he morphs into a cascade of vagueness and indecisiveness. Plans are often spontaneous, seldom respecting your convenience or preferences, and discussions about feelings or future are artfully dodged or enveloped in ambiguity. This erratic dance between closeness and ambiguity can sew seeds of confusion, anxiety, and self-doubt, making you question your worth and place in his life. It may initiate a turbulent internal dialogue, where deciphering genuine interest from strategic play becomes a mental and emotional tug-of-war. Seeking clarity and asserting your need for clear communication is crucial. Engage in conversations where you express your feelings and your need for clarity and commitment. Remember, your emotional peace and self-respect are paramount, and establishing a relationship on a foundation of clear communication and mutual respect is non-negotiable. Interactions that are predominantly governed by one person’s convenience and whims can significantly mar the equilibrium that healthy connections thrive upon. When the scales tip notably towards his comfort, availability, and desires, it’s essential to pause and reflect. He texts, calls, or wants to meet predominantly when it suits him, often disregarding your schedule, feelings, or convenience. Your attempts to reach out or plan might be met with evasion, excuses, or half-hearted commitments, yet your availability is expected when he reaches out. This lopsided dynamic might embed feelings of being undervalued and merely an option, sparking emotional unrest and dousing your self-esteem. There might linger a persistent strain of trying to be “available” lest you miss an opportunity to connect, thus placing your needs, plans, and emotional peace secondary. Recognizing your worth is pivotal. Your time, emotions, and availability are valuable and should be respected reciprocally. Establish and adhere to your availability and convenience boundaries, ensuring that your life, plans, and emotional peace are not perpetually disrupted or disrespected. As we venture deeper, it’s essential to observe how our emotions, concerns, and voices are received, acknowledged, and respected in a connection, ensuring that the echoes of our hearts are not drowned amidst manipulative tactics. Your concerns are brushed off as overreactions, and your feelings are minimized or ridiculed. He might employ tactics like gaslighting, making you question your emotional responses and reality, thereby maintaining a deceptive upper hand in the dynamics. Being perpetually undermined can severely dent your confidence and emotional stability, enveloping you in a fog of self-doubt and suppressed emotions. The constant belittling might constrain your voice, thereby limiting your expressive freedom and emotional authenticity. Maintaining a supportive circle where your feelings are validated and respected can be a protective shield. Confronting the undermining calmly, expressing its impacts, and demanding respect for your emotional expressions is crucial. Intricate webs of manipulation can often be veiled under the guise of vulnerability, pleas, or victimhood. Recognizing, confronting, and safeguarding against such tactics ensures that the equilibrium of respect and genuineness is maintained in interactions and connections. He may skillfully weave narratives where he emerges as the perennial victim, thereby excusing his missteps and deflecting accountability. Even when confronted, the blame is artfully shifted, perhaps even to you, manipulating scenarios and emotions to his benefit. A constant barrage of such manipulations can erode your trust, not just in him, but in your own judgements and perceptions. It can incubate guilt, making you feel perpetually at fault, and potentially spiraling into a vortex of emotional and mental exhaustion. Cultivate an environment of factual recall and honest communication. Maintain a record of instances that seemed manipulative and communicate clearly about your observations and feelings. The beauty of genuine connections is often mirrored in the symphony of mutual support, understanding, and care. Recognizing disparities in this domain is crucial to ensure that the relationship doesn’t devolve into a one-sided emotional or physical investment. He leans on you during his times of need, seeking emotional, physical, or even financial support. Yet, when the tides turn, your needs, vulnerabilities, or crises are met with apathy, disregard, or token involvement. Such a one-sided dynamic can lead to emotional depletion and a sense of being used. It can undermine your worth, making you question the genuineness of the connection and sowing seeds of resentment, disappointment, and emotional fatigue. Communicate clearly about your expectations of mutual support and your observations of disparities. Establish boundaries that safeguard your emotional and physical resources, ensuring that they are not exploited or exhausted. As we steer through the vast ocean of relational dynamics, these reflections, experiences, and insights become our compass, guiding us through calm and stormy weathers alike. Your experiences, reflections, and insights are not mere stories but are beacons of shared wisdom, lightening paths for others in this collective journey.

I’m not talking about the things that catch our eye from across the room — but the subtle nuances and habits that truly draw our attention? The actions, mannerisms, behaviors, and even the mindsets that make them seem so…magnetic? You know people like this, you’ve met them, and maybe you even are one of them. Some people naturally possess the traits that empower them to act in these ways, and others consciously work at developing them. Regardless of the source, in this article we’re going to explore some of the subtleties that, while small on paper, make a big impression in real life. Attractive people possess and project confidence, we all know this — but what does confidence look like? This is a lesson I learned through experience over the years of appearing on stage and television. I’d watch myself afterwards and notice if I was talking too fast, or moving my hands too much (sorry, I’m Italian), and would be critical about whether or not I looked too frantic or rushed. After all, a TV spot may only net you a couple of minutes of airtime. You’ve got to get your point across without wasting too much time. BUT, if you look too hurried, or nervous, or chaotic…people are going to tune out. You’re sending the subconscious message that you don’t think what you’re saying has enough value to keep people’s attention, so you try to cram as much of it in as possible while they’re still listening. I noticed that my body language and verbal presentation made a much larger impact when I’d just take a deep breath, relax into the chair, sit back and act like I was having a conversation with a friend. It puts everyone in your audience at ease, and actually draws them to you because they’re wondering what you’re about to say next. I believe that just taking a couple of seconds to consciously assess our own body language and non-verbal communication when in a social setting can make a massive difference in how much confidence we… "

Ambitious, strong-minded, independent, focused, an out and out go-getter. A survivor in the face of failure. (Attractive? Goes without saying.) He was pretty quickly hooked. He couldn’t get enough of her. Their life together was going to be something pretty special. And it was. Until — er — it wasn’t. To be fair, the relationship I’m describing here lasted a long time. Ten years, two kids, a dog, a cat and an axolotl, long. And they did have many great times together. A decade in, he loved her, still. But by the time I met him (he came to therapy alone) he was exhausted. Every issue, every decision was a battle, a battle he never seemed to win. “It’s her way or the highway over money, the kids, weekends, holidays — everything— and so sick of it. It feels like I’m bashing my head against a brick wall.” “Your wife’s a pretty stubborn person, then?” “That might be the understatement of the year,” he said. Officially speaking, to be stubborn is to be doggedly determined. So, on the face of it, stubbornness can be viewed positively. Being persistent, seeing things through, being confident in your views and judgment is a good thing. So is independence, intense focus and self-confidence. That’s why when my clients describe themselves as stubborn, they’ll often say it lightly, or with a hint of pride. “Oh I can be stubborn, haha.” But when they describe their partners the same way, the blood drains out of their face (okay I exaggerate) — but it’s a huge frustration. That’s because stubbornness inside a relationship is hard to live with. The stubborn — read dogmatic — partner tends to take control. And once they’ve made up their mind about something, there’s no shifting it — even in the face of a very good counter argument. Which leaves their partner feeling helpless and — worse — unheard. Like their feelings and views… "

She had a clash with a work meeting. No problem. We rescheduled. A week later, she postponed again. She’d been “pulled into a meeting that couldn’t be changed”. We rescheduled. But (as I waited for the next postponement) I wondered about the wisdom of her therapy investment. She’d come to see me for a metaphorical “shot in the arm”. She described persistent fatigue, low energy, feeling flat and unmotivated and a slow burning discontent. There was little fun, no joy, nothing much to get excited about. Her days were bleeding together in a long, blurry flatline. When she thought about the months, the years ahead three words rang in her ears. My client felt guilty seeing a psychologist. With all that was going on in the world, she said, it seemed self-indulgent. Fair point. If you compare your first world misery with the plight of people in Gaza and Israel right now, you’re not going to come out on top. But, no matter what horror is going on in the world, or even next door, it’s still important to live your own life as well as you can. It’s not self-indulgent to take care of yourself. My client didn’t need a therapist to tell her she was burnt out and meeting the clinical criteria for mild depression. She’d read the room, she’d been clocking her symptoms for a while. But she did need someone to help her unpack why she was a puppet on a string to her boss, her staff, her family, literally everyone who asked anything of her. Why she persisted in taking on things she didn’t have time for, and didn’t even want to do. She needed someone to help her understand why she didn’t — couldn’t — put herself first. Why she didn’t rate her own therapy higher than an online middle management meeting. "

After a tumultuous decade, she had left him. He was still circling, still testing her, but she was sure — she was done. The final straw wasn’t just the last episode of cheating. Or the excavation of their joint bank account. Or the last jagged fight. It was all the years of trying to make it work; the hopeful periods, followed by the ugly bursts of emotion, the unreasonable verbal attacks, the cold silences, the sulking, the slow chipping away at her sense of self. It was the best of times, followed by the absolute worst. It was all the insincere apologies, all the promises to do things differently that were destined to be broken. It was no longer having the energy for him. And yet. She was haunted. As a psychologist, I’ve worked with a lot of people who’ve had their hearts broken. Some — not all — of those heartbreakers have been narcissists, some have had toxic traits, some haven’t been that way at all, they just wanted out. But when the ex is a narcissist (or had ingrained toxic traits) there can be an added layer of difficulty to leaving the relationship behind. Especially if you were together for a long time. Because the way the narcissist functions has such a significant impact on the mental/emotional health of their partner. And on the way they see love and themselves. Interestingly, a lot of people seek therapy a long time after a toxic relationship is over. At the time of the breakup, they are too busy dealing with the logistics and the emotional chaos of it. It’s only when the dust (or maybe it’s more like mud) settles — months or even years later — they are left with a nagging question. "

My person. The one I can’t get enough of. Better still, the one who can’t get enough of me. Another fantastic weekend passes. She shakes her head to check she’s still on Planet Reality. This relationship is incredible. Where’d they come from? How’d I get so lucky? Are they actually for real? That question — are they for real — is probably the best one you could ever ask. But in the throes of love and lust, you won’t ask it. You’ll be too high on hormones and possibility. Fair play. This is how many great relationships start. But (sorry to rain on the love parade) many horror shows start the same way. Wonderful. Then, worrying. Then, how much of a fool was I? Emotional intelligence (EQ) — a person’s ability to notice, manage and express their emotions healthily — is pitched as the gold standard in relationships. Some people have an advantage when it comes to developing EQ because they’ve had emotionally skilled teachers (usually their parents). And some people are disadvantaged out of the gate because they didn’t have the same (or any) emotional lessons at home. But EQ is not all about parenting, or even genetics. Yes, our base temperaments play a part; some people find traversing the emotional landscape extraordinarily difficult. But our life experiences, successes and failures, the world and the people around us, also contribute to our emotional development — in both good and unhelpful ways. Many people have to be their own emotional teachers, trying to make sense of the world as they travel through it — and that can offer up some significant challenges. "

If this sounds like a big statement — that’s the entire point. Emotional availability is what opens someone up (or not) to love, affection, and mutual effort in the first place. Without it, nothing you say, do, or are will ever be “enough,” because being “enough” isn’t the point — being ready for love, is. How, then, can you tell that someone is not ready to receive you, no matter how badly you want them to be? Have you ever seen the meme of the kid riding down the street on his bicycle? It’s framed like a comic book — in the first frame, he’s riding down the street, holding a stick. In the next frame, he starts to put the stick in the spokes of his own wheel. In the final frame, he’s laying on the ground, holding his leg, passing the blame onto something or someone else. When someone is emotionally unavailable, you’ll find that they almost seem to create problems that didn’t actually exist before. Maybe they’re highly nitpicky, or overly critical, or zooming in on small issues in order to make them big ones. It’s important to note that this isn’t necessarily because they’re being malicious or mean — but simply because they’re not ready to receive healthy love, so they’re subconsciously looking for “ways out,” or ways to justify that it “just didn’t work” when things fall apart. We all know that trust is a foundational piece of any relationship — without it, there is no room for love, respect, or affection to grow. There’ll always be a wall in place that blocks some of, if not all of, the future from opening up in front of us. "

There’s something irresistible and even mysterious when we do things differently to most. That doesn’t mean that everything we do that’s different will attract others. Here are some examples of things most people avoid that are often highly attractive to others: Such a simple thing. But it’s not easy to do. Many don’t even realise it when they do it, but they interrupt, not to be intentionally rude, but often out of insecurity. When we interrupt, we inadvertently signal our sense of inadequacy. We want to be seen. So we undermine the attention others are getting to steal back some for ourselves. This is low-status activity and will lose you respect. Give people space. This is what leaders do. They are in no rush and are totally happy for others to be in the limelight. Developing a higher-than-average level of skill for something isn’t common. It demonstrates perseverance and grit that many don’t have. Whether it’s mastering juggling or reaching higher echelons of achievement as an artist, teacher, dancer, writer, or sailor, this all emphasises your stand-out quality. Reaching higher skill levels is attractive to many in a similar way as reaching celebrity status can. Being a little different at the surface level of appearance needn’t mean walking around like a goofy freak gimmick. Subtlety wins here, especially in a world where everyone is tripping over themselves to stand out with an over-emphasis on appearance. Wear something that interrupts the expectation others might have of someone like you. "

The ones who didn’t get snatched up in their 20s because, for one reason or another, they weren't marriage material? I would certainly like to think not. But whenever I speak to men, there tends to be a stigma about women in this age group. “Women in their 30s are entitled and set in their ways.” “They already had their fun around town and bring tons of baggage into any new relationship.” “They’re desperate and in a rush to find someone before they age out of the dating market.” Ouch. Things like pursuing an education or focusing on one’s career could result in taking time away from dating. Women in these categories are not necessarily running around town with tons of men, or suffering through one fractured relationshipship after another. But men still may not find them attractive, because women who pursue education and career above all else are often seen as masculine. Truly, truly, we can’t win. "

We will explore their killer features and shortcomings with real-world deployment examples. We will look at frameworks such as vLLM, Text generation inference, OpenLLM, Ray Serve, and others. Despite the abundance of frameworks for LLMs inference, each serves its specific purpose. Here are some key points to consider: If this has caught your attention, I invite you to delve deeper and explore them in more detail. For the hardware setup, I used a single A100 GPU with a memory capacity of 40 GB. I used LLaMA-1 13b as the model, since it is supported by all the libraries in the list. The article will not cover traditional libraries for serving deep learning models like TorchServe, KServe, or Triton Inference Server. Although you can infer LLMs with these libraries, I have focused only on frameworks explicitly designed to work with LLMs. Fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving. It achieves 14x — 24x higher throughput than HuggingFace Transformers (HF) and 2.2x — 2.5x higher throughput than HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). Offline Batched Inference: API Server: While the library offers user-friendly features and a wide range of functionalities, I have come across a few limitations: This is the fastest library for LLM inference. Thanks to its internal optimizations, it significantly outperforms its competitors. Nevertheless, it does have a weakness in supporting a limited range of models. You can find vLLM Development Roadmap here. A Rust, Python, and gRPC server for text generation inference. Used in production at HuggingFace to power LLMs API-inference widgets. Run web server using docker: Make queries: I believe this is one of the leading contenders in the race. The library is well-written, and I faced minimal challenges during model deployment. If you desire native integration with HuggingFace, this is definitely worth considering. Note that the project team recently changed the license. You can find TGI Development Roadmap here. CTranslate2 is a C++ and Python library for efficient inference with Transformer models. First, convert the models: Make queries: I find the library intriguing. The developers are actively working on it, evident from the releases and commit on GitHub, and they also share informative blog posts about its application. The library’s numerous optimizations are impressive, and its primary highlight is the ability to perform LLM inference on the CPU. MII makes low-latency and high-throughput inference possible, powered by DeepSpeed. Run web server: Make queries: The project is based on the reliable DeepSpeed library, which has earned its reputation in the community. If you seek stability and a tried-and-tested solution, MII would be an excellent option. Based on my experiments, the library exhibits the best speed for handling a single prompt. Nonetheless, I advise testing the framework on your specific tasks before implementing it into your system. An open platform for operating large language models (LLMs) in production. Run web server: Make queries: This is a good framework with a wide range of features. It enables you to create a flexible application with minimal expenses. While some aspects might not be fully covered in the documentation, you will likely discover pleasant surprises in its additional capabilities as you delve into this library. Ray Serve is a scalable model-serving library for building online inference APIs. Serve is framework-agnostic, so you can use a single toolkit to serve everything from deep learning models. Run web server: Make queries: If you need the most production-ready solution that is not just about deep learning, Ray Serve is a great option. It is best suited for the enterprise, where availability, scalability, and observability are important. Moreover, you can use its vast ecosystem for data processing, training, fine-tuning, and serving. And finally, it is used by companies from OpenAI to Shopify and Instacart. Machine Learning Compilation for LLM (MLC LLM) is a universal deployment solution that enables LLMs to run efficiently on consumer devices, leveraging native hardware acceleration. Run web server: Make queries: If you need to deploy an application on an iOS or Android device, this library is exactly what you need. It will allow you to quickly and natively compile and deploy the model to devices. However, if you need a highly loaded server, I would not recommend choosing this framework. Selecting a clear favorite was challenging for me. Each library has its unique advantages and drawbacks. LLMs are still in the early stages of development, so there is no single standard to follow yet. I encourage you to use my article as a foundational starting point in choosing the most suitable tool for your requirements. I did not touch upon the topic of model inference costs, as they vary significantly based on your GPU vendor and model usage. However, some helpful cost-cutting resources can be found in the bonus section below. During my experiments, I used some services and libraries that could be useful for you as well: And then all you have to do is just run the command: If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to connect on LinkedIn.

One of the challenges they face is that such large models require a huge number of resources for deployment (inference). Accelerating model inference is an important challenge for developers. It is related to reduced fees for computing resources and the application response speed. The development of LLMs and the infrastructure around them is evolving at an unthinkable rate. Every week, new approaches emerge to speed up or compress models. In such a flow of information, it’s hard to keep a finger on the pulse and have an idea of what techniques really work, not just on paper. I tried to understand what improvements are available now for implementation in the project and how much they allow to accelerate the inference of LLM models. The article is a bit long, so here is a summary of the main points: Let’s now discuss all these points in more detail. I chose Falcon — the latest open-source large language model released by Technology Innovation Institute. It is an autoregressive decoder-only model with two variants: a 7 billion parameter model and a 40 billion parameter model. The 40B model variant was trained on 384 GPUs on AWS for two months. Based on what is known about the model, Falcon architecture is very similar to GPT-3 and LLaMA, except for using multiquery attention (Shazeer 2019) and RefinedWeb corpus as a training dataset (which can be a key to success). To conduct my experiments, I used the Lit-GPT library, which includes an implementation of open-source LLM and is powered by Lightning Fabric. As for the hardware setup, I used a single A100 GPU with a memory capacity of 40 GB. To initiate experiments, the first step involves downloading the model weights and converting them to the lit-gpt format. This is quite easy to do with the following scripts: To execute the model, just run the following: When training deep neural networks on a GPU, we typically use a lower-than-maximum precision, namely, 32-bit floating point operations (in fact, PyTorch uses 32-bit floats by default). In floating-point representation, numbers are stored in a combination of three parts: the sign, the exponent, and the significand (or mantissa). In general, a larger number of bits corresponds to a higher precision, which lowers the chance of errors accumulating during computations. However, if we want to speed up our model, we can reduce the precision to, for example, 16-bit precision. How this can help: Lit-GPT uses the Fabric library, which allows us to change the precision in a few lines of code. Mixed-precision training is an essential technique that lets us significantly boost training speeds on modern GPUs. We don’t transfer all parameters and operations to 16-bit floats. Instead, we switch between 32-bit and 16-bit operations during training, hence, the term “mixed” precision. This approach allows for efficient training while maintaining the accuracy and stability of the neural network. Bfloat16 is a floating-point number format proposed by Google. The name stands for “Brain Floating Point Format” and originates from the Google Brain artificial intelligence research group at Google. Here you can read more about Bfloat16 arithmetic. Google developed this format for machine learning and deep learning applications, particularly in their Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). While bfloat16 was originally developed for TPUs, this format is now supported by several NVIDIA GPUs. You can check whether your GPU supports bfloat16 via the following code: If you have bfloat support, you can run the following command: The results from above are summarized in the following chart: If we want to increase the model performance during inference even more, we can also move beyond lower floating point precision and use quantization. Quantization converts the model weights from floats to low-bit integer representations, for example, 8-bit integers (and, recently, even 4-bit integers). There are two common approaches for applying quantization on a deep neural network: Since we want to speed up an existing model, we will use Post-Training Quantization. You can read more about different techniques of post-training quantization here. Since 4-bit and 8-bit precision for Falcon models is not implemented yet, I will show an example with LLaMA 7B using Lit-LLaMA. While fine-tuning may not be a direct method for expediting the inference process of the final model, there are a few tricks that can be employed to optimize its performance: Using these methods in combination, you can increase the effectiveness of your model. Within the realm of adapters, several variations have emerged, including LLaMA-Adapter (v1, v2), LoRa, and QLoRa. Among these, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out prominently. LoRA introduces a minuscule number of trainable parameters, referred to as adapters, to each layer of the LLM. Simultaneously, it freezes all the original parameters. This approach simplifies fine-tuning by updating only the adapter weights, significantly reducing memory consumption. The QLoRA approach, which added quantization and a few other optimizations to LoRA, revolutionized how we can fine-tune a model on a Google Colab instance! Fine-tuning an LLM can be resource-intensive, entailing a considerable investment of time and computational power. For instance, fine-tuning Falcon-7B can take around half an hour when executed on 8 A100 GPUs or approximately three hours when using a single GPU. In addition, optimal results require proper preparation of the dataset. While I haven’t personally performed the fine-tuning process for the model, if you wish to embark on it yourself, you can initiate the procedure by running the following command (read more about it here): For further details and in-depth information, I recommend the following resources: Network pruning reduces the model size by trimming unimportant model weights or connections while the model capacity remains. The new method LLM-Pruner adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving most of the LLM’s functionality. The authors demonstrate that the compressed models exhibit satisfactory zero-shot classification and generation capabilities. The article's authors have posted the code, but supported LLMs are only LLaMA-7B and Vicuna-7B. Here’s another interesting pruner — Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations). This approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. Also, it allows us to prune LLMs to 50%. GPUs, renowned for their massively parallel compute architectures, boast astounding compute rates measured in teraflops (floating-point operations per second) for models like the A100 and even petaflops for models like the H100. Despite the immense computational power available, LLMs often struggle to fully exploit the potential due to a significant portion of the chip’s memory bandwidth being consumed by loading model parameters. One effective approach to mitigate this limitation is through batching. Instead of loading new model parameters for every input sequence, batching allows for loading the parameters once and utilizing them to process multiple input sequences. This optimization strategy efficiently utilizes the chip’s memory bandwidth, resulting in higher compute utilization, improved throughput, and more cost-effective LLM inference. By employing batching techniques, the overall performance of LLMs can be significantly enhanced. One recent such proposed optimization is continuous batching. Instead of waiting until every sequence in a batch has completed generation, Orca implements iteration-level scheduling, where the batch size is determined per iteration. The result is that once a sequence in a batch has completed generation, a new sequence can be inserted in its place, yielding higher GPU utilization than static batching. There are several frameworks where you can use this algorithm: After careful evaluation, I opted for vLLM as my preferred choice. vLLM utilizes PagedAttention, the new attention algorithm that effectively manages attention keys and values: it delivers up to 24x higher throughput than HuggingFace Transformers without requiring any model architecture changes. Considering the unavailability of support for Falcon within vLLM, I made the decision to utilize LLaMA-7B instead. I was thoroughly impressed by the remarkable speed at which it operated. Moreover, the framework facilitated the seamless setup of the API server, enabling swift deployment. To initiate the process, execute the following command: Then you can check the functionality with this code: You can find a more detailed review and benchmarks of Batch Inference here. You can also use the Fully-Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) distributed strategy to leverage multiple devices to perform inference. It is important to understand that using multiple GPU devices does not speed up inference but allows you to run models that wouldn’t fit in a single card by sharding them across several. For instance, falcon-40b would require ~80 GB of GPU memory to run on a single device. We can instead run it on 2x A6000 (48 GB) still using Lit-GPT, adding just a few parameters: Which will take 46 GB of memory and run at 0.60 tokens/sec. Alternatively, we can use vLLM, which generates text much faster simply by setting tensor_parallel_size to 2. Since vLLM does not support Falcon, I decided to show how you can easily deploy a model using Text Generation Inference. To adhere to the recommended best practices of the framework’s authors, it is advisable to execute the provided command and run the application within a Docker container. Run the docker container: During my own experience, the process involved approximately two minutes to download the Docker image and 30 seconds to download the scales. Subsequently, it took roughly 20 seconds to convert the scales from the .bin format to .safetensors. Finally, the download of the final model required approximately one minute to complete. These time estimates provide an overview of the process's duration of these specific steps. You can check API with the following command: Other alternative libraries for the LLM Inference: Read more about them here. The field of LLM acceleration is a complex landscape that is still in its infancy. While preparing this article, I encountered numerous recently developed methods, some showing promising potential (appeared within the last 1–2 months). However, it is important to note that not all acceleration methods work without compromise. Some methods may degrade the quality of the model. Consequently, it is unwise to accept and apply all acceleration advice without careful consideration blindly. You must remain vigilant in controlling the quality of the accelerated model. Ideally, achieving a balance between software optimization and model architecture is the key to achieving efficient LLM acceleration. "

This week OpenAI had its first-ever developer conference. Fewer times in history had there been higher expectations of a private technology event, and the OpenAI did not disappoint. They announced a new, smarter GPT-4 model named ‘Turbo’ and they included several fascinating features that severely improve outputs and offer developers much more control over their models. And all this while still managing to decrease, once again, API costs. But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

But the viewpoint is mostly as an interviewee, not as an interviewer. In my 25 years in Big Tech, I’ve conducted over a thousand interviews (eight hundred at Amazon as a Bar Raiser, a couple of hundred at Microsoft, and shy of a hundred at Google). Big Tech has 3 types of interviews for Software Engineers: [1] Coding, [2] Systems Design, [3] Leadership, soft skills, culture, etc. Loops tend to have a blend of these 3. For example an SDE-I might have 3 coding, 1 systems design, 1 leadership, while a Principal Engineer might have 1 coding, 2 systems design, 3 leadership. I personally prefer the more open-ended Leadership interviews, as I feel I learn more about the candidates that way. But Coding interviews are a necessary evil. For coding interviews, I have often asked a variation of the following problem, loosely based on something I had to do in real life. Since I decided to retire the question, I’ll dissect it today. I want to focus on explaining what I looked for in a candidate with this question. The question is not particularly difficult, but it does require a little bit of thinking and knowledge of code complexity and data structures. You can easily get the customers that came on both days, you can easily get the customers that visited at least two unique pages, but getting the intersection of those two efficiently requires a little more work. I’ve probably asked it 500 times, which has allowed me to calibrate it quite well. I have found that a Hire / No Hire decision from this question aligns with the final loop Hire / No Hire decision on a candidate about 95% of the times. I can also upscale it for higher level candidates, which makes it fairly versatile, and there’s many hints I can give to candidates struggling along the way. Great candidates must ask clarifying questions before jumping into coding. I’m hoping to see some intuition from my candidates as I’ve actually expressed the problem in an ambiguous way. Did I mean 2 unique pages per day or overall? This significantly impacts the solution. I mean “2 unique pages overall” because that’s a much more interesting problem. About half the candidates jump straight into coding without clarifying this, and out of those, half assume incorrectly that I meant “2 unique pages per day.” If it’s a more junior candidate, I’ll hint heavily before they start coding. If it’s a more senior candidate, I’ll wait a bit and see if that comes up as they’re thinking more deeply about the algorithm. In real life, engineers deal with ambiguity all the time, and the root of most software problems can be traced back to poorly defined requirements. So I want to get a signal on spotting and dealing with ambiguity. There’s one more clarifying question that 90% of people miss upfront, but that also matters: What about duplicates? Visits to the same page in the same day? What about visits to the same page on different days? For this problem, these are duplicates. Another clarifying question that matters is what scale are we talking about here? Does the data fit in memory? Can I load the contents of one of these files in memory? Can I load the contents of both? The question was inspired by a real-world system that I worked on at Amazon, called Clickstream, that was responsible for tracking user behavior on amazon.com. We processed petabytes of events from millions of concurrent customers on a giant Hadoop cluster of ten thousand hosts, and we had an entire team of engineers maintaining and operating the system. But for the purposes of a 45-minute interview, just imagine the data fits in memory, with a much smaller scope. Lastly, another clarifying question that is important is how much does Performance vs Memory vs Maintainability matter? There’s a naive solution that is O(n²) in running time, but only uses O(1) of memory. There’s a better solution that has running time of O(n) but uses O(n) of memory. And there’s an in-between solution that does some pre-processing in O(n log n) with O(k) of memory, which allows you to run the main algorithm in O(n) with O(1) of memory. Each one has pros and cons. Some of the heuristics you may use for improving performance or memory usage may make the code harder to read and evolve later on. On more senior candidates, I’m hoping to have a spirited chat about these. In theory you could write a pretty simple SQL query, and sure, Big Tech companies have giant data warehouses where you can easily do this sort of thing. But for the scope of a coding interview, you wouldn’t want to. Since this is not a distributed systems problem and the data fits in memory, why introduce the additional complexity and dependencies of a database for something that you can solve with 20 lines of simple code? Starting point: About 80% of the candidates go for the naive solution first. It’s easiest and most natural. It’s some form of “for each element from file 1, loop for all the contents of file 2, looking for elements with the same customer id, and keeping track of the pages they view.” The problem with the naive solution is that its running time is O(n²). I don’t mind getting the naive solution first, but I really want to see my candidate having that aha moment that O(n²) is probably never good in any problem. And I want that aha moment to come pretty quickly and without hints. No great engineer should ever settle for an O(n²) algorithm, unless bound by memory or some other unmovable constraint. After a candidate puts forth the O(n²), I smile politely and I wait. I am really hoping the next words that come out of their mouth are “…but the complexity of this is O(n²) so can I do better?” I’ll probe, “what’s the running time of this solution”? And most of the times, the candidate will have the aha moment after that hint and move on to a better solution. At this point you need to do some thinking about what data structure you’re going to use, and how you’re going to store your data. Poor candidates go for linked lists, or arrays. You don’t know the size of the data upfront, so you can’t use arrays. And linked lists have O(n) search, therefore you’ll end up back to an O(n²) algorithm no matter how hard you try. You can use a Tree, but since search is O(log n), that’ll yield an overall best of O(n log n). Better candidates have the intuition that a Map will provide the O(1) lookup that they need to turn the O(n²) algorithm into an O(n) algorithm. Great candidates will proactively point out the downside is that you’ll use O(n) memory. If you want to be more pedantic about it, you can even point out maps have the hidden cost of running a hashing function over and over again, which can be expensive. Overall, faster running time at the expense of more memory is a good tradeoff to highlight. If you’re using a Map, what is your Key, and what is your Value? I’ve seen all kinds of answers here. Some candidates use PageId as the Key, and CustomerId as the Value, but that is not going to help. Candidates then switch it around to have CustomerId as the Key, and PageId as the Value of the Map. But that’s not particularly great either because it overlooks the fact that you can have many pages per customer, not just one. Some candidates have the intuition that they need a Collection of pages as the Value of the Map, but they’ll go for a List, which saddens my soul because it overlooks the fact that you can have duplicates. This is a good opportunity to probe around data structure knowledge on Lists vs. Sets, as candidates think about handling duplicates. So, Map<CustomerId, Set<PageId>> will do. But will you load the contents of both files into a single Map? Or have two maps, one for each file? Or can you get away with just loading the contents of file 1 into a map, and processing file 2 without storing it? Great candidates realize they can go for option#3 right away on their own. That’s a lot less memory, and a simpler algorithm. Good candidates get there, but need a little hinting. The condition “customers that came on both days” is pretty simple: as you’re reading a customer entry from Day2, if the customer is in the Map from Day1, then you know they came on both days: The condition “customers that visited at least 2 unique pages” tends to be a little harder for candidates to get right, so if they’re stuck I throw a little hint: you have a Set of pages from Day1, and a single page from Day2… how can you determine that this is at least two unique pages? Poor candidates will loop through the elements in the Set to check if the page from Day2 is in there. This turns your O(n) algorithm into O(n²) again. The number of candidates who have done this is surprising. Better candidates will do a .contains() on the Set which is an O(1) operation on a hash set. But there is still a catch with the logic. The intuition to get this right is this: If you are inside that If loop and the customer visited at least two pages in Day1, and they visited any page in Day2, they’re loyal, regardless of which page they visit in Day2. Otherwise, they only visited only one page in Day1, so the question is: is this a different page? If so they’re loyal, else it’s a duplicate so you don’t know and should keep going. You need attention to detail, like using “>” instead of “>=” or missing the “!” in the second clause. I saw these fairly often. I didn’t worry. Great candidates spotted them quickly as they double-checked the algorithm when they were done. Good candidates spotted them after a little bit of hinting. That gave me a good signal on debugging skills. If candidates get to this point and we have some extra time, it’s kind of nice to probe on how to optimize for either speed or memory usage. Bonus points for some discussion about tradeoff between these versus future maintainability. For example, if memory is a constraint, you don’t need to actually keep every single page from Day 1 in the Map, just two, since the problem is “at least two pages” so a Set of size 2 or even an array of size 2 will use less memory than an unbounded Set. Or, if you’ve already determined that a customer is loyal, you don’t need to waste CPU cycles going thru the logic again next time you encounter that customer in Day 2. The vast majority of candidates go for the Map approach, but sometimes I have a candidate go for the other one. Maybe 5% of the time at most. What if you pre-processed the files and sorted them by CustomerId, then by PageId? Pre-processing is a powerful tool in your software engineering arsenal, particularly if you’re going to be performing an operation a bunch of times. You can take the hit of pre-processing with the first one, or do it beforehand, which amortizes the cost over time. Sorting the files can be an O(n log n) operation with constant memory. If the files are sorted, then the problem is easier and it’s just a two-pointer algorithm that you can execute in O(n) with O(1) of memory. You move the pointers for file 1 and file 2 until they’re both on the same CustomerId, which means they came on both days. Since the second sort key is by PageId, you use another two-pointer algorithm to determine that there are at least two unique pages. So it’s a 2-pointer algorithm within a 2-pointer algorithm. It’s kind of a fun problem! I’ll leave the actual implementation as an exercise for the viewer. I hope this little insight into a coding problem from the viewpoint of an interviewer, and the ways in which I’ve seen great, good and poor candidates approach it, has been useful to you. Best of luck in your next interview! "

At first glance, they may not seem like much. Reading OpenAI’s announcements, it’s easy to get bogged down in the nerdy specificity of some of these new additions. But make no mistake; as technical as they may seem, OpenAI’s new announcements have the potential to change the world just as much as ChatGPT did around this time last year. Here’s the core of what OpenAI announced, and why it matters. One of OpenAI’s most exciting announcements was the availability of the GPT-4 Vision platform through their API. Previously, OpenAI had released the Vision platform only via their ChatGPT interface. Vision is super powerful, but was somewhat limited — in order to use it, you needed to log into ChatGPT and upload your images manually, a few at a time. Adding Vision to OpenAI’s API is a game changer. It means that instead of having to use a manual process, developers can now build vision capabilities directly into their own applications. A screen-reader company, for example, could build the system into their software, allowing visually impaired readers to have a description of any image on the internet instantly created and read aloud as they surf. I tested this new capability myself and it’s pretty remarkable. Media companies like my company, Gado Images, can use the Vision platform to understand the visual contents of our databases of tens of thousands, or even millions, of images. That capability makes it way easier to locate valuable parts of a collection. "

We’ll be using an AI generator that barely anyone ever talks about it. And I’m pretty sure this story is going to leave your jaws dropped. Now, most of the side hustles I share are very simple, in terms of the structure and steps you need to follow. If you can use the tips I share to focus on a specific keyword in a smaller market, you’ll make money for sure. How many of us are fashionistas or love a good fabric pattern? Well what if I told you it was possible to start out your own fashion line with almost no effort. Yeah, I’m serious. And no, I’m not writing this story just for the fashionistas, there’s room for everyone with this side hustle. The best part is that I’ll be sharing highly popular online platforms, where you can sell these patterns to generate a steady stream of passive income. Now remember, the images we’re talking about are patterns So, we’ll be generating these patterns to sell online using AI art generatorsm And for this, allow me to introduce Creative Fabrica Spark. First, we need the ideas or niches. Simply head over to ChatGPT and ask for pattern ideas that can be generated with AI. Now, these are quite broad niche ideas, so let’s narrow them down a bit. Ask ChatGPT to give you 10–20 sub niches for your favorite category. Now that we have the ideas we need, let’s head over to Creative Fabrica Spark. So Creative Fabrica Spark is a suite of AI tools but we’re particularly interested in its pattern generator. So once you choose the pattern generator, it’s time to start generating. You can copy-paste this simple prompt & replace it with your specific idea to generate the pattern of your choice. Now, Here’s the pattern I generated with Creative Fabrica Spark using this same prompt. I don’t know about you but this pattern is pretty amazing. Now, With the ideas from ChatGPT and a tool like creative Fabrica Spark, you’ll be able to generate endless images and patterns to sell online. This has to be the most important part of this story, so pay attention. You guys loved Zazzle the last time I talked about it. So here’s another idea for you. At least this time, AI is doing almost everything for you. Now, Zazzle gets over 24.2 million visitors per month. On Zazzle, you just need to upload a digital copy of your pattern on products like Zazzle will then handle the entire shipping costs and customer service while you make passive income. Creating a Zazzle shop is free, and I found a seller who was making a pretty sustainable income of over $7,000 per month. This is another lesser known print on demand website, which means less competition and more sales for you. Don’t be deceived, Society 6 gets over 3.3 Million visitors every month and works just like Zazzle. Moreso, I found a seller who made $7,091 selling patterns on Society 6. Sounds familiar right? Creative Fabrica, Creative Fabrica Spark! Yeah, they’re the same website. So you can basically create and sell patterns on the same marketplace. The only difference is that you won’t be selling your pattern as a physical product but instead as a digital product that can either be In fact in my creative Fabrica shop, I sell AI generated patterns as bundles alongside my Canva templates. AI is getting better and better everyday. Before now, it would have taken a super skilled designer to make a pattern like what we generated. Now, with just a simple prompt, AI does it all. But wait! I got way too excited about this new found side hustle, that I almost forgot to mention something important. Well, I couldn’t also justify spending $19 on the subscription for this side hustle.

Here is this week’s edition of the Language Learner’s Digest. This photo has a funny story behind it. I am running a session on basic video production and editing at a summer camp this week. All the students have a Chinese background with most of them being teenagers. There was a scene where a big poster on a wall was in the way of the kid’s shot. I, jokingly, said I would stand with a blanket to cover the poster. However, apparently this strategy actually worked xD As a result, I stood there for 10 minutes or so looking silly until they got their scene recorded. It was quite funny. On a more language related note, this camp has allowed me to get lots of Mandarin listening & some speaking practice because most of the kids speak Mandarin with each other. It’s been fantastic! Despite my lower-intermediate level, it’s weird how my brain switches to “Mandarin Mode” while at the camp seeing as that is mostly I am surrounded by. Phases of Knowing Vocabulary and/or Grammar I realized something the other day: there are three “phases” of knowing a vocabulary and/or grammar point in a foreign language: 1. Theoretical understanding. You have learned the vocab/grammar point, but would really struggle to use or understand it in real-life scenarios. 2. Conceptual understanding. You have a decent grasp of the vocabulary/grammar point. You can use and understand it in real-life situations with some mental effort. 3. Automatic understanding. You can use and understand the new grammar/vocabulary concept with minimal effort. Many people have a hard time getting past step 1 and 2. Here are a three quick tips that can help: - Set goals of using the new grammar and vocabulary. I would recommend picking 3 difficult concepts and using them 1–2x every day for two weeks. I’d recommend doing this in both written and spoken forms.- Use pictures to lock the meaning of new words into your brain. Don’t rely only on translation.- Get feedback from advanced or native speakers to ensure you are using the new grammar/vocabulary properly. Often we struggle because we feel insecure about making mistakes and being misunderstood. Getting feedback & validation from someone more advanced than you can help resolve this.

https://medium.com/@polyglotazren/language-learners-digest-july-23-29-6a8c8de4478b?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Hi everyone :) As you may have noticed, I have changed the name of these blog posts from “Week in Review” to the “Language Learner’s Digest”. I like the name a little bit more and have decided to change it. I may change it back if the response to the name change is not great, but I want to test the change for now. Here is the language learning content featured this week. I would potentially like to start including content created by others, so feel free to send any content suggestions to me on Facebook or Instagram (PolyglotAzren is my handle on both). As many of you know, I am reading a book called Fluent Forever by Gabriel Wyner (@fluentforevertips). I am loving it! This paragraph here interested me a lot. I’ve never been one to do many grammar drills, and yet still can typically apply grammar rules better than most other language learners I come across. The reason is that I have always done what Gabe says on this page, with a few additions/minor adjustments: 1. I make a conscious effort to USE the examples I memorized multiple times a day in real life scenarios to engrain them in my brain. 2. After doing point 1 above, I add a couple more examples that fall into the same grammar category & use them daily to lock them into my brain. By repeating this point and point 1, my brain natirally catches the pattern and I can apply the grammar rule unconsciously. 3. Until reading Gabe’s book, I never made flashcards. However, his flashcard system is something that has been accelerating my progress in Mandarin and has been a useful additon to my language learning toolbelt. In a nutshell, to maximize the effectiveness of flashcards you should ensure to include a PERSONAL CONNECTION and PICTURE to each card you make. Don’t just rely on translation. Cards should be reviewed using an SRS app such as Anki. There is more to it than that, but that is a simplified explanation. I may make a more detailed blog post solely on flashcard making another day. Thanks for reading this! Hope it helps you with your language learning journey. Blog Post on Facebook: Are Some Language Really Inherently More Difficult? Yesterday I posted a poll asking if you thought certain languages were inherently harder than others. 81% of the 16 votes think that YES, some languages are inherently harder than others. This, in my perspective, is false. The truth is that some languages will be more difficult for YOU. That does not make that language inherently easier or harder. Here’s an example from my life. I didn’t find it incredibly difficult to learn Spanish for various reasons. Some of those reasons were the following: a. I already spoke French. Both Spanish and French share some similarities because they’re within the same language family. b. Almost every letter in Spanish exists in my mother tongue. Therefore, the pronunciation was relatively simple for me to pick up. c. Many words in Spanish sound or look similar to English and/or French. d. Grammatically, Spanish was not THAT different to anything in French or English. On the contrary, Mandarin was a different story. The sounds were a lot more foreign, the grammar was wildly different than anything I’d seen before, and characters just made my brain hurt. However, I had this experience NOT because Mandarin is harder to learn than Spanish. Instead, it was due to Mandarin sharing fewer similarities to anything I had learned before. I’d recommend that you check out this list by the Foreign Service Institute. It outlines the easiest and hardest languages to learn for a native English speaker: https://www.atlasandboots.com/foreign-service-institute-la…/ Quick Post from Facebook…Have Fun! Quick language learning tip: make sure you are having fun! It will exponentially increase the speed at which you learn. If you are not engaged while learning, your odds of becoming fluent are slim. Another Takeaway from Gabriel Wyner’s Book, “Fluent Forever” “With 2000 words, you’re at 80% comprehension”. This is a key sentence from the book “Fluent Forever” by Gabriel Wyner. For most people, that is more than you’ll need to know to achieve your goals in a foreign language. This is especially true if you learn words based on how frequently they are used and/or based on your specific needs. In fact, by focusing solely on studying vocabulary that people often use, you’ll rarely struggle to navigate the majority of day-to-day situations & conversations. All of that being said, I am most fascinated about needing 5.5k — 12.5k words to have 90–95% comprehension because that is normally my goal when studying a language. This confuses many because my definition of “speaking a language” is vastly different than most people. For example, when I was in India in Februrary & March many Gujaratis would say, “why are you studying Gujarati?? You already speak it quite well!”. This happened because their definition of fluency was probably centered around knowing 2000 words while mine is centered around knowing considerably more. Facebook Blog Post: The Surface Problem is Rarely the Real Issue This was a conversation I recently had with a follower (please excuse my many spelling & grammar errors in the photos). They initially thought that their main obstacle when it came to learning English was procrastination. However, after digging a little further I learned that they actually practiced daily, meaning that procrastination likely wasn’t a major problem. If you practice every day, you clearly don’t procrastinate too much. Based on the conversation, I think the REAL challenge has more to do with attaining a B2 level (upper intermediate level) before the end of this year. It also seems like this follower has struggled to add extra study time in the mornings, seemingly because of “procrastination”. However, after looking under the hood it appears as if the root issue has more to do with fatigue. In other words, the fatigue CAUSES this follower to not study in the morning. Lastly, the follower believed that they should be studying 3 hours per day. While doing that would be FANTASTIC, it is typically way more than what is needed. Thankfully, you can improve significantly by practicing considerably less. Therefore, the follower was potentially feeling bad about “procrastinating” only because they had an unreasonably high standard of how much they should be studying/practicing daily. As a conclusion, my follower thought that procrastination was her biggest obstacle with learning English when in reality there is so much more going on. This served as a reminder to me that the SURFACE problem(s) is/are rarely the ROOT problem(s) when it comes to language learning. Thanks for reading!

I have had a lot on my plate and I made the decision to shift my attention away from these “Week in Review” blogs. However, I am back for this week! Here are the content highlights from the week. July 17, 2018 on Facebook: I used to think that listening comprehension was all about grammar and vocabulary. In other words, I believed that if you knew enough words and had studied enough grammar, you could understand when native speakers speak. However, as I became more experience with language learning I realized that this isn’t always the case because some individuals don’t focus enough on “ear training”. Let me give you an example. My mother tongue (Gujarati) has three letters that sounded identical to me (ર, ડ, ળ). To my ears, they all sounded like ર. As a result, I sometimes wouldn’t understand native Gujarati speakers because my brain couldn’t process and decipher the sounds that they were making. It wasn’t until I trained my to hear the difference between the three letters that I noticed my listening comprehension improve. Simultaneously, I noticed my own pronunciation improve because I could hear all the words that I used to mispronounce. Therefore, I highly encourage all of you to study the sounds of your target language as well as the grammar and vocabulary. If you don’t have a good understanding of the language’s phonetics and sound systems, listening comprehension will likely be more challenging for you. Thanks for reading!

Sorry for the delay this time around on getting this post out. Here is the content summary for last week. July 3, 2018: Are You Making Enough “Neural Connections”? July 4, 2018: How Effective is 30 Minutes a Day of Studying? July 5, 2018: Good if Often Better Than Great July 6, 2018: Private Lessons vs Group Lessons: Which One is Better? July 7, 2018: The Boring Days Drive the Exciting Days July 8, 2018: A Listening Comprehension Tip for Beginners & Intermediates Earlier today I posted a poll asking people if listening comprehension is easier than speaking a foreign language. The early results have got me thinking…is one inherently harder than the other? On one hand, one could argue that SPEAKING is harder. It is a much more active skill and it can definitely be more nerve-wracking. That being said, I’ve met plenty of individuals who speak well, but who struggle to understand what people are saying. As a result, I am inclined to think that neither is inherently easier/harder. I think it has more to do with: A. How someone has learned the language. For instance, there was a point where I could navigate Beijing speaking Mandarin because I had memorized the phrases I needed to know. However, I often couldn’t understand people’s comments to me because all I had focused on at the time was being able to SPEAK, not understand. B. Learning style & personal preferences I am going to ponder this question some more to see if any other ideas come to mind that I didn’t mention here. I posted a poll today asking if remembering vocabulary was hard for you. So far the early results are close to 50/50. Seeing as many of you find this difficult, here’s something that might help. The two biggest mistakes people make when it comes to remembering new words is that they: 1. Make vocabulary lists based solely on translation. They’ll write the new words in the target language and put the translation right beside it.2. To remember the words on the list, they either read them various times and/or write them over and over. Although the above-mentioned strategies work, they typically don’t create enough neural pathways to remember them long term. Additionally, you find it hard to recall the terms quickly in real-life conversations. So how do you fix this? The answer is simple enough: make the words more memorable. This can be done by: - Using pictures to support the translation (see the photo below for an example).- Engaging multiple senses. FEEL the object in your hands. TASTE it. LOOK at it. Make some NOISE with the object. Etc.- Connect the word to a significant memory in your life. This is especially effective for complex/abstract concepts. For example, if you were trying to remember a Spanish word for “fuel economy”, you might connect that to the gas-guzzler car you owned at the age of 18 that probably shouldn’t have been legal to drive anymore.- Write interesting stories using the new vocab. You’ll also want to review these terms to keep them in your memory. I’d recommend using a Space Repetition flashcard app such as Anki. Use these tools and you’ll find it significantly easier to remember vocabulary in a foreign language. This has been my phone background for a while (made by @drock). When you look at the picture & text, what does it make you think of? How does it make you feel? What comes to mind? I feel like it could mean different things for different people. Personally, it serves a reminder for me to keep my head down and stay in my lane. I only need to focus on my path and not be overly influenced by other people’s thoughts, beliefs, lifestyles, etc. Thanks for reading!

Hope you had a great week :) Here is the content summary for this week. June 25, 2018: Teaching Yourself a Language? Here’s Some Advice June 26, 2018: What to Study First When Learning a Language June 27, 2018: The Only 3 Things You Should Care About June 30, 2018: Intensive Studies, Momentum, Perspective, and More It’s been a while since someone has asked me to do their homework for them, but the answer is still, unequivocally, no. I will NOT do anyone’s homework for them! As many of you know, I’ve been working on being healthier & more active since mid 2016. A small hack that has been allowing me to eat more veggies is leaving a bowl of veggies on the table. Because they are easily accessible, I eat them. I know it has nothing to do with languages, but I thought I would share regardless! Hair isn’t done and I need to shave, BUT the message is still true. Learning a language is all about taking small steps every day to progress in your language.The irony of this post is that it’s the opposite of what I’ve been doing recently. I study Mandarin about 1–2 times per week which is not enough. However, I am doing regular Gujarati practice and am noticing my progress, especially with reading & listening comprehension.I have a small challenge for both you, the reader, and myself: let’s spend at least 5–10 minutes on a language that we’ve been neglecting. For me, that will be Mandarin. If you’ve been diligent with your studies, let’s “up the ante”. Do 5–10 minutes of something CHALLENGING in your target language. A few options: post a video of you talking on Instagram, watch a video on YouTube that is harder to understand than usual, set up a language exchange with someone on italki.com…anything. Do something that makes you think to yourself, “wow, that would be tough…”Good luck! If you want, post what you are going to do and your results in the comments below. FAQ: “How many hours should I study per week?” Answer: It depends. Here is a scale you can use to determine the right answer for you: Under 2hrs/week: not enough2–5hrs/week: bare minimum6–9hrs/week: good10–14hrs/week: great15–19hrs/week: serious language learner20+hrs/week: intensive studies Most of you should likely be aiming for the “bare minimum” or “good” category. That is a manageable amount for anyone with a full time job or who is a full time student. If you need to learn a language quickly for whatever reason, you can start looking at the “great” or above categories. For people with lots of time on their hands (i.e between jobs, on summer break, etc), it’s worth considering the “intensive studies” to make noticeable progress rapidly. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want help structuring your study schedule. Time for a #ThrowbackThursday. It’s fun to look back at older content to see what I said and if my thoughts on the topic have changed. For this one, I still agree with what I said. If you want to achieve a low intermediate (aka a B1) level in 2 years or less, you should be studying 10+ hrs per week. You also need to pick your study topics strategically based on what vocabulary will be frequently required. One thing I’ll add is the following: if you were to study LESS than 10 hours per week on average, it is still possible to achieve a B1 level. For example, if you took an intensive course for 2 months where you practiced for 20+ hours per week, achieving a B1 level seems do-able. Additionally, I think the target language plays a factor because everyone will likely find some languages to be easier than others. Now that I think about it, some people are just faster at learning languages in general which is yet another factor I didn’t originally mention. All of that said, if you aim for an average of 10+ hours of strategic studying per week, you have excellent odds of achieving at least a B1 in 2 years, even if you are a slower learner than the “Average Joe”. Such a common question, so I thought I’d share this snippet of a conversation I had with a follower. Making a study plan is as simple as finding free time on a daily basis & using it to study/practice. In terms of WHAT to practice/study, it will depend on your overall goals & level. However, three things that can give you some direction are: taking classes, following a self-study program, and/or following a textbook. *Note as I am writing this “Weekly Review” post: to see the full conversation between me and the follower, please visit the Instagram post below. It is a series of pictures.* Just shared this on my Instagram story, but here’s the full version of what happened. I was just out for a run and suddenly I kept seeing the 2 bird shadows on the ground circling me. I looked up and there were two crows swooping at me! Apparently I was running close to a nest. I SPRINTED in the other direction, but the crows wouldn’t stop chasing me. I think they wanted to be 100% sure that I wouldn’t come back to the area (mission accomplished).So long story short…my run was more effective & a better workout than I expected :P Thanks for reading/watching!

https://medium.com/@polyglotazren/week-in-review-june-18-24-2018-21501edfb531?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"Hi everyone! Hope you had a great week :) Mine was excellent. Here is the content summary for this week. I ran a free accent reduction workshop last week. This is a short clip where I talk about the first step to learning a difficult sound or letter in a foreign language. It is so hard to improve your pronunciation or accent without doing this first step, so I highly recommend spending time on it. Full video is here: https://youtu.be/bWBkRSPJFIA Answer: Put in the time. Learning a language is just like any other skill. If you don’t practice regularly, you won’t get better. Answer: Ultimately you only have so much time in a day. If you want learn a new language, you need to make it a priority and create space in your schedule. A few ways to do that are: - Be more efficient and/or organized with your time to open up space to study.- Wake up 15–30 minutes earlier every day and use that time to study.- Reduce the time you spend on something else and put it towards your language studies (i.e less social media, Netflix, etc).- Listen to language learning audios (i.e Glossika) while you commute to work/school. Hope this helped! Have a great rest of the day :) Feeling “unmotivated” to study a language often has to do with your environment. Who are you hanging out with? What content are you watching online? How many hours do you spend at work or doing other activities unrelated to language learning? These are all factors to consider. If nothing in your physical or digital life has to do with languages, you will not spend much time on that aspect of your life. It’s a simple question of, “out of sight, out of mind”. That’s why I recommend you are mindful of your environment. A practical strategy that works is to follow accounts online that produce content that teaches your target language. Alternatively, if your level is high enough you can follow shows or personalities online who speak the language you’re studying. That way, you will see content on a daily basis in your target language. An effective “real world” tactic you can try is labelling the things in your house. For example, if you were learning Spanish, stick a paper on your window that says “la ventana”. Do that with various objects in your home. This willl create a physical environment that reminds you to continue moving forward and progressing. There’s SO many ways one can approach learning a language. A “best method” does not exist. As long as you are practicing regularly and adjusting your approach accordingly based on your results, you’ll be sccessful. However, this often brings up the following question: if there isn’t a “best method”, how do I know which pathway to follow? The answer is simple: follow the one that appeals to you most. Do your research by searching through YouTube, Google, Instagram, and other online/offline sources. I promise you there will be a teacher, application, audio program, or some other resource that appeals to you. Use that resource and go all-in on it until it’s not bringing you value anymore. When that happens, adjust your course of action. Full video here: https://youtu.be/2RG_6sGak3k These are screenshots of a conversation I had with someone in the comments of a Facebook post. As you can see, the individual originally felt like they didn’t have enough time to put towards language learning. They were even thinking about finding a new job to open up more space. However, after digging a little deeper this person realized that they spend about 2 hours a day on watching videos/social media. In other words, they actually DO have time to acquire a language. I think the lesson to be learned here is that we generally have more time than we think. It’s simply a matter of analyzing where our time is going on a daily basis and making the necessary adjustments. Let's have some fun & embarrass myself at the same time. I am a weird person. Here are some odd language facts about me: 1. I often mix up ""lions"" and ""tigers"". Unless I stop to think, I consider them as the same animal. 2. I often mix up ""ginger"" and ""garlic"". I can rarely remember which one is which. 3. For years, I said ""mug cup"" instead of saying ""mug"". 4. I only recently discovered that you can't say ""I am lawnmowing"" and that you should say ""I am mowing the lawn"". I also often say ""snow shoveling"" instead of ""shoveling the snow"". 5. I have weird names for some movies & books. For example, I call ""The Jungle Book"" Mogli (or is it Mowgli?) and the Ferocious Beast. I also recently started saying ""Dinosaurs"" instead of ""Jurassic Park"". 6. I speak to my mom with a slight Indian accent...even though she doesn't have an Indian accent. I also sometimes take a slight Indian accent if I speak to someone who has one. 7. I think ""razors"" should be called ""shavers"". 8. Instead of ""nose hair trimmer"", I say ""nose cutter"" 9. I don't know why, but I sometimes use the word ""washing machine"" instead of ""dishwasher"". 10. Until last year, I thought that the expression was ""two peas in a POT"" and not ""two peas in a POD"". 11. Until grade 11, I thought ""LMAO"" stood for ""laughing my arm off"". 12. I feel like ""flip flops"" should be called Flippy-Floppies. 13. As a child, I couldn't pronounce the words ""hospital"" and ""Tylenol""...so I avoided saying them at all costs, even after I spent a week sick in the hospital.

Here is the content summary for this week. 5 Questions I Get Asked Frequently…let’s go! I speak English, French, and Spanish very fluently. I also speak Gujarati (conversational), Mandarin (low intermediate), and Hindi (very basic). - English: this is my native language- Gujarati: I grew up speaking it with my family and have been actively studying it since late 2017.- French: I attended a French immersion school from the age of 5. I also studied & lived abroad in France for 5 months and majored in French at university.- Spanish: I took two classes in high school, spent 3 months abroad in South America, and majored in Spanish at university.- Mandarin: I took two classes at university, studied for 3 months in China, and have taken some lessons online.- Hindi: I’ve done some self-study, but nothing more than that. I teach English, French, and Spanish to both children and adults. I run small group lessons and 1–1 private lessons. Additionally, I work with adults to help them reduce their accent in English, French, and/or Spanish. Honestly, I don’t necessarily think this is true. It has more to do with my lifestyle. I have been surrounded by multiple languages ever since I was a child. Currently my life continues revolves around language learning seeing as I am always learning or teaching different languages. Therefore, I don’t think I am necessarily “super smart”, but rather my lifestyle and interest in languages has been conducive to me being multilingual. I do! First of all, I want to perfect my Gujarati & Mandarin. From there I will move on to Hindi. The final two on the list are Arabic & Russian. I am quite structured with how I live my life. I schedule everything into a calendar and most things I do are deliberately chosen based on my current priorities and/or future goals. Because of this, I typically live by a checklist. As long as I am doing everything on the list while still spending time with the important people in my life, I feel happy and “in-sync”. Unfortunately, the past couple of weeks I have been quite unfocused and more “out-of-sync” than usual. I’ve learned from past experience that I feel this way any time my checklist no longer matches my priorities/goals. Therefore, I spent some time to reconcentrate on what’s really important to me and I revised the contents of my checklist. This picture is the rough draft. I still need to work out a few things and put a final version on the front of my laptop, but I am pleased with what I’ve come up with so far :) :) I’ll keep focused on this list, while of still spending time with the important people in my life. That will get me back on track. First of all: no idea what is going on with my outfit & how I look right now, haha. But in more important news: I had a really abstract thought today after stumbling across Jessie Reyez. Jessie does such a FANTASTIC job of storytelling in her music, and it made me wonder about the role of “storytelling” in language learning. What unconscious stories/messages am I telling when speaking Spanish? Are they the same as when I speak French? How do things change when speaking a language I am less fluent in like Mandarin? How much effort should we be putting into the storytelling aspect of learning/speaking another language? These were all things that I was asking myself. I put together a quick podcast digging into this topic a little more. If you have a spare 10 minutes and are interested, you can listen to the episode here. Curious to hear your thoughts on this as well if you have any :) June 11, 2018: Want to Be Super Fluent? The Answer is Lifestyle. June 12, 2018: Summer is Coming…Don’t Get Complacent!

Here are the main highlights from this week :) I want to share two simple yet effective writing tips. They are based on errors I made in an Instagram post last week that are extremely common (see circled words and phrases in picture). 1. Have someone edit your work. This will eliminate small mistakes such as typos (i.e when I spelled “regularly” as “regularily”) 2. If you use a word in a sentence, avoid using it again in your next sentence. It is not always possible, but do your best. I did this with: - Years - Over the…- Formulas Hope these helped! Send me a message if you ever have questions about improving your writing. I made my to-do list earlier today and I realized something about written language: all of us have our own short-hand. There are things on this sheet that make no sense, unless you already had previous background info about me. For example: 1. Pron = pronunciation. That is always how I write this word if I am trying to save time. 2. “Update prep” = fill out the required tabs in an excel sheet I use to track the back-end of my business. 3. FB = Facebook. I also use this short-hand for the word “feedback”, but it depends on the context. For the word feedback I will sometimes write f/b. 4. Guj = Gujarati 5. Chin = Chinese I am curious: do you guys use a lot of short-hand as well? Or is it just me? Many language learners (myself included) think more about studying than actually studying. This is not a good idea. Therefore, I challenge you to spend an additional 15–30 minutes today working on a language you’re currently working on. Use this post as a reminder to “do” instead of “think”. Happy studying!

This week I attended various wedding events for my aunt’s wedding. Therefore, a good percentage of this week’s summary contains wedding photos and videos. Enjoy! Here’s a random fact about me: I have a bit of an Indian accent when I speak to my mom. This is because when I was growing up, I was expected to speak Gujarati to my family. As a result, if there was a word I didn’t know how to say I would just say it in English with a slight accent haha. The best part is that my mom doesn’t have an accent at all in English xD Someone recently asked me how my Gujarati level has changed since being in India for two months. Here are the major improvements: 1. I can write relatively comfortably2. I can read slowly3. I can understand and speak using a more “standard” dialect. My family has a unique dialect of Gujarati and now I understand the differences between how we speak compared to others.4. My vocabulary has increased5. My knowledge of Gujarati grammar is a lot deeper than before There is lots left for me to study and learn, but those are some of the main improvements I’ve noticed. Clip from an interview with the Instagram account “lang_fest” Before mid 2016, I used to be extremely unhealthy. I worked in a high stress job, slept 5–6 hours a night, ate very few fruits & veggies, consummed lots of carbs, never exercised, and didn’t drink much water every day. In other words, I was making all the unhealthy decisions one could make (apart from drugs and heavy drinking). However, from mid 2016 onwards have been gradually focusing more on being healthy. Currently I: - Have a relatively balanced diet- Sleep 7.5–8 hours per night- Exercise 2x per week- Drink about 6 glasses of water per day- Feel way less stressed There’s lots I still need to do before I am 100% satisfied with how healthy my lifestyle is, but it is a major improvement from before. One thing I have noticed is that my stress has a direct correlation to how much I have taken care of my body. If I make healthy decisions for a few days in a row, I tend to feel more relaxed than if I don’t. This may seem like common sense. That being said, I have to remind myself of it because I often blame my stress on work when the root cause is that I didn’t make healthy choices for a few days. I talked about this a little bit in this vlog, along with other life updates & advice for language learners. If this is too small for you to read, here is what I wrote: “Hi all. I am excited to announce that I will be posting regularly about another aspect of language that I don’t usually discuss: writing. As a child, I found it so hard to put my ideas on paper. Luckily, I had plenty of support at home from my mom. After years of daily lessons, I was finally able to write at a competent level. The main concept that I learned over the years is that there are simple “formulas” you can follow that instantly improve our writing. Over the coming weeks, I will be sharing some of these formulas so that ou can use them yourself. I am excited to see where this new project leads!! Oh man…I forgot that I used to make these “Language Music Videos”. I really think there are some really creative & effective things I can do with them. Maybe it’s time I start making them again #throwbackthursday #throwback Always testing different things, such as this “60 Second Wedding Vlog”. Hope you enjoy!

Another week has gone by and we are just about to start another one. Here is the summary of what I posted this week on my social networks. As per usual, there is a lot of content. There were 5 blog posts, 3 podcasts, and 5 YouTube videos. I would recommend skimming through this post and only consuming what is most relevant/interesting for you. One of the hardest things about learning languages is verb conjugations. Unless you are learning a language like Mandarin where verbs don’t change forms, it can be extremely challenging to accurately express your thoughts in the correct tense. Here are a few tips that I recommend to remedy this. Different strategies will work for different people, so I suggest you try a few to see what is the most effective for you. 1. Do writing drills. For instance, if you wanted to memorize all the present tense forms of the verb “manger” in French, you would write “je mange, tu manges, il/elle/on mange, vous mangez, ils/elles mangent” repeatedly until it is engrained in your brain. It is tedious and can be a painful process, but for many it works. 2. Keep a regular journal and have it corrected by an advanced or native speaker. The daily writing practice will give you many opportunities to practice different verb conjugations and learn to use them properly with a high level of consistency. 3. Read regularly. This will expose you to real life examples to how different verb tenses are used. It woll also familiarize you with various common verbs and the different forms they can take. 4. Talk to yourself and make a specific note to use the tenses that you’re finding challenging. I do this when I have downtime (i.e when I am driving, getting ready in the morning, etc). Doing this allows you to practice speaking even if you don’t have someone to practice with. 6. Watch/listen to content in your target language. If you do this, make sure you are paying special attention to the verb conjugations/tenses that you are wanting to improve. 7. Memorize key phrases only. Sometimes verb tenses and conjugations feel so foreign that the brain simply can’t absorb them. In this scenario, focus on remembering one common phrase at a time that requires the use of that conjugation/tense. For example, in Spanish I used to struggle with remembering how to use the verb “to say” in the past. Despite all my efforts, I couldn’t do it. Therefore, I only memorized how to say, “he/she said” until that phrase came naturally. Only then did I move on to other forms of the verb. Hope this helped!! I don’t often give advice for academic writing, but I thought I would share something today. A few of my students find it hard to correct their own writing and rely on me or their teacher to find their mistakes. In order to make them more self-reliant, I’ll often give a “writing checklist” with a few things the student should edit by themselves BEFORE our lesson. This is a checklist that one of my younger students uses. An important thing to note is that the list should be adapted based on age and overall writing skill. Not connected to language learning, but I made Mapo Tofu today! I can officially add this to the small (but growing) list of things I can make :) In hindsight, this applies to various aspects of language learning, not just writing. It’s all about engaging various senses and learning styles when learning. For example, using this tip where I am “singing” while writing helps me by engaging: 1. The muscles in my hand as I write2. My ears and auditory memory3. My eyes and visual memory as I see the character(s) I wrote Try engaging various senses when learning a language and you’ll find that you’ll remember what you study at a deeper level. Just finished doing my daily Mandarin studying. Here are the main things that are standing out to me: 1. Even though it has only been a week or two of practicing, my stamina is increasing. I can write for longer periods of time without getting tired. Additionally, I am remembering more and more characters by heart. This reminded me that a lot of progress can be made in a short period of time if you practice daily. 2. My printing is still quite messy…but it is improving! Unlike before, most of what I write is at least legible. 3. I wrote a silly story about me being unprepared for the 1st day of school to practice some new vocabulary. Using stories to remember vocabulary is incredibly effective and I highly recommend it. 4. In my story, I rewrote any characters, words, and lines that I couldn’t print by memory. This helped me to engrain them deeper in my brain. I also did not worry about being able to write anything I’ve never written before and simply wrote it in English letters.

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/how-150-freelance-linguists-help-us-train-tens-of-thousands-of-language-professionals-6accea76a668?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"We talk a lot about how technology is transforming the way we teach and learn language. But we don’t talk enough about the transformation in how we create language learning content — and the team that helps us do it. In contrast to many language learning companies, we primarily support government and professional language training programs. As one might expect, the content is very different than for casual learners. Not only do we need highly skilled, reliable content creators, we need experts in less common language with exceptional knowledge of less common topics and terminology. It’s not about ordering in a French restaurant. Our team is typically supporting courses and creating lessons on cybersecurity in Russian, public affairs outreach in Korean, or even more specific topics in more obscure languages. On top of that, the timetable has changed. In addition to language courses, we support professional linguists continuously maintaining or enhancing their language skills on the job. Every week we publish “CL-150 Cohort lessons” in a range of languages and levels. Each lesson has ten or more activities, is aligned with a particular ILR proficiency level, and is based on recently-published authentic content on topics relevant to our professionals — high-impact, custom lesson creation at scale. Creating CL-150 Cohort lessons requires a unique set of skills, as our Content Development Manager, Orsi, explains: Though CL-150 Cohort lessons are self-guided, they are often leveraged by instructors. Even if Cohort authors won’t be teaching themselves, they understand how an online lesson are by virtual or classroom teachers and choose learning activities and supporting materials accordingly. Cohort authors are also highly sensitive to proficiency levels — an ILR 2+ learner won’t reach the 3 required to do their job if they’re learning only on 1+ and 2 materials, and materials that are too difficult are less effective. Authors can’t just choose any level-appropriate materials, either. They need to keep up with world events and the target culture to find highly relevant, timely materials that support government linguists’ missions. The hiring process includes interviews, a qualification test that measures passage rating knowledge and proficiency levels, and approval by trusted native speakers in their given language. Once hired, Cohort authors complete a rigorous month of training, covering everything from the proprietary Transparent tech, to passage rating, communication, project management tools and online collaboration platforms. Because our Cohort authors can work remotely, we’re able to hire team members and freelancers based on skills and passion rather than location and schedule. That flexibility allows us to find the very best. Here’s the thing about working with the best of the best — they’re always looking to get better. In that sense, creating Cohort lessons is the perfect fit. Our linguists offer their expertise in the language, while gaining new expertise in the specialized domains and unique requirements of working with professional language programs. A member of the Spanish Cohort team called this work the “highlight” of her 10+ year teaching career and considers our ever-changing tools, guidelines, and requirements the best kind of challenge — “like continuing professional development.” Even with her years of experience, she still refers back to her reference collection to verify her work. When not working for us, she teaches Spanish classes to government linguists — and she uses them as a barometer for potential Cohort lesson subjects. When a topic or current event is particularly interesting to her classroom students, she makes sure to find recent material to cover it in a Cohort lesson. Another team member who works on Arabic Cohort lessons appreciates how the work prepares her to return to the classroom and embrace the changing role of teachers in the 21stcentury. No longer are teachers just lecturers who regurgitate information from a textbook. Nowadays, instructors often go off book, creating their own materials and facilitating interactive, communicative activities to reinforce the material. CL-150 Cohort lesson creation forced her into that same space of creative thinking, searching for fresh, engaging materials and questioning how learning activities can be best leveraged to reinforce that material. In discussing her experience with Transparent, she says she’s thrilled that her assignments were refreshing and reinforcing what she had learned while earning her MA in Second Language Teaching. Perhaps best of all, she’s able to continue working and honing her skills while staying at home with her newborn baby. Remote assignments — translation, course development, audio review, and beyond — empower her to meet family obligations without sacrificing income or job experience. Continuity can be just as important as flexibility for some of our team members. One Arabic linguist can carry her job around the world, a vital benefit to a military spouse who must relocate every few years. Rather than starting over in a new job each time, she has progressed through our ranks to become our senior-most Arabic instructor, who now helps to recruit and train new team members. The benefits of challenging, flexible remote work are mutual. We get to work with the best of the best people, and they get to do their best work from, well, wherever they want. That flexibility leads to better job performance and more job satisfaction. Finding and retaining the right team is a labor of love. Cohort coaches receive lots of support from their managers at Transparent as they get started, but the return on that investment is high according to our Senior Content Project Manager, Priscilla: And expand it does. Initially started as a pilot program with one ILR level in a handful of languages, the Cohort coaching team now publishes lessons in 42 language and level combinations. In 2018, the team averaged 54 lessons per week, for a total of more than 2,800 lessons. The confluence of the right team, the right training, and the right tech allows us to produce powerful custom lessons at a scale and efficiency previously impossible. The tools can handle the creation, assignment, and tracking of any number of lessons in any number of languages — as long as we have the right people at the helm. Think you might be the right person for our Cohort team? Learn more about Transparent Language and take a look at available openings. We hope to hear from you!

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/history-has-taught-us-the-value-of-foreign-languages-have-we-learned-our-lesson-327825800fa2?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"From the Cold War era to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, we need not look back too far to realize the scale of America’s language gap — and why we must fill it before history repeats itself. History repeatedly reminds us of the complex and critical role of languages, from the post-9/11 need for Arabic skills to the inability in 2014 to distribute Ebola prevention materials to local communities in languages they understand. And today, we are committed to all languages in service of our partner organizations, who regularly add and share their own content in new and surprising languages. They deem these languages critical for their work in disaster relief, intelligence, security, diplomacy, business, and beyond and we believe them. These languages spring up for myriad reasons: international political shifts, military partnerships, natural disasters, and even language preservation efforts. Regardless of the reason, we believe in being prepared for as many situations in as many languages as possible. It is impossible to predict where the next opportunity or obstacle will arise. In a time of political, environmental, or other crisis, there is no time to provide meaningful language training to first responders, diplomats, intelligence analysts, and other critical players. Look no further than recent US history for proof of the desperate need for language preparedness. In 2004, a part of a call for more and better Arabic language training, the New York Times reflected on the curious case of Russian language learning during and after the Cold War: “Less than a year after the Soviet Union launched a satellite named Sputnik in October 1957, America answered with a counterstrike. It was a piece of legislation, the National Defense Education Act, which aimed at harnessing brain power rather than weaponry for the cold war […] a portion provided incentives for universities to develop skilled speakers of strategic languages, especially Russian.” That legislation led to more than 30,000 American students learning Russian — many of whom would become the translators, analysts, diplomats, and policymakers who brought the Cold War to a peaceful resolution many decades later. As one might expect, military linguists were among those learning Russian during the Cold War. To listen in and analyze gathered intelligence, linguists were highly trained to listen and read in Russian at the Defense Language Institute (DLI). But there was one major problem, revealed in a New York Times article (this time from 1990): these linguists had learned to spy in Russian, but not necessarily to speak it. When the Berlin Wall fell, language training programs had to turn on a dime to meet urgent peacetime requirements, which were “more stringent than we ever had in the Cold War” according to the then-chancellor of DLI. One student considered the new training requirements a new job entirely, a change from translating intercepted communications to actually communicating with Russian counterparts about missile disarmament and “making small talk on the plane ride to the missile site.” This rapid shift — and the scramble that followed — prompted the American military to rethink its language courses and prepare for the fact that “young linguists will need better language-speaking skills and a deeper appreciation of foreign cultures.” The Cold War era taught us the importance of committing to well-rounded language skills and cultural knowledge. But the post-9/11 era did not see the same groundswell of support for language learning when Arabic skills were desperately lacking. Legislation modeled after the National Defense Education Act (the same piece of legislation that bolstered Russian language education) failed to make it out of committee, never reaching a vote in Congress. The Modern Language Association’s Language Enrollment Database maintains all higher ed enrollment data since 1958. In the two years following the launch of Sputnik, Russian studies among students enrolled in four-year institutions spiked from about 16,000 to over 31,000. But one year after 9/11, only about 8,700 students attending four-year institutions were enrolled in an Arabic course. That’s a far cry from the Cold War numbers for Russian, and a tiny fraction of other language enrollments in 2002, including 530,000 students were learning Spanish. The lack of support left America effectively mute when it came to communicating in Arabic and other critical languages at the time. Dan E. Davidson, the President of the American Councils for International Education, made the level of need clear: “Compared to the Cold War, we’re not even at the level of zero […] we’re at minus one.” A report in early 2002 by the General Accounting Office confirmed that shortages of linguists had ”hindered U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism and diplomatic efforts” for at least four agencies, including the military, State Department, Foreign Commercial Service, and FBI. The FBI, for example, had thousands of hours of audio and thousands of pages of documents in Arabic and Central Asian languages that needed to be translated. The good news is that more than 30,000 students were studying Arabic by the 2016 academic year. The bad news is that overall foreign language enrollments are down (experiencing the second largest drop since 1958), and all these years later American still faces a foreign language gap that leaves us unprepared for many opportunities and obstacles. Language is entangled in more than the intelligence or military aspects of security, including global health. One of the greatest threats to any population is the rapid emergence and spread of disease — even when it’s happening a world away. Consider the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014 that claimed more than 10,000 lives. Ebola is highly contagious, but we also know how to contain it. Communicating that information to affected populations quickly and clearly is at the heart of containment efforts. That task is made more difficult — 90 times more difficult, perhaps — when the affected countries speak more than 90 local languages. With most materials disseminated in English and French, much of the population was left in “deadly ignorance”. Multilateral government relief efforts, non-profits, and other responders must be prepared to work in the context of the local culture — including the local languages. Aimee Ansari, Executive Director of Translators without Borders highlights language as being equally important as food or water in times of crisis: “Meaningful two-way communication fulfills a vital function in an emergency response, as pivotal as providing food, water, or health services. To keep themselves and their families safe, people need critical information in a language they understand, such as, in the case of Ebola, how to best wash their hands or bury their loved ones. To be effective and accountable, responders need to be able to understand the needs and concerns of affected people.” Language preparedness is also more than an attempt at survival in the face of global political, security, or health challenges. It is a key factor in our ability to thrive on the wings of rising economic opportunities around the world. In 2013, only 1.561 million U.S. college students were taking any foreign language classes (a number that has since dropped another 9.2%). But in 2014, a NAFSA: Association of International Educators study revealed that almost 30% of executives say they’ve “missed out on opportunities over a lack of on-staff language skills.” Upwards of 40% said language barriers prevented them from reaching their “international potential”. This is not a new trend, nor one that will soon wane. The global economy is trending away from the traditional English-speaking powerhouses. Economists predict that China’s economy will surpass America’s during our lifetime, while markets in Brazil, India, and beyond continue to expand. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, exports accounted for half of post-recession U.S. economic growth, and “future U.S. growth will increasingly depend on selling U.S. goods and services to foreign consumers who do not necessarily speak English.” These “goods” range from architecture to insurance to mobile technology, meaning language skills complement nearly every industry, not just the obvious ones. As noted in the Boston Globe, “banks and cellphone providers are hiring employees who can communicate with potential customers in their native tongues. Software firms are seeking out translators and customer service representatives who can help them build their business around the world. And health care providers looking to serve the immigrants in their communities, as well as patients traveling to the United States for medical care, are beefing up their staffs with people who can understand, and convey, their concerns.” Language and cultural competency are in demand not just in large, diverse cities like New York or Miami, either. It seems the entire country is seeking a bilingual workforce; the number of online job listings “targeting bilingual workers more than doubled nationwide between 2010 and 2015, rising 162 percent, according to a new report by New American Economy.” In Colorado alone, job postings seeking bilingual candidates doubled between 2011 and 2014, for example. With all of these examples in front of us, why haven’t we learned our lesson? Past events emphasize the critical role of languages in communicating with foreign populations, collaborating with foreign partners, and containing foreign threats. Yet fewer than 20% of K-12 students are enrolled in a foreign language class (compared to the average rate of 90% across Europe) and higher ed enrollments are down more than 9% since 2013. If we stay on that trajectory, we may risk being left out of the conversation entirely. So, what should we learn from our past failures? The language gap is perpetuating in the wake of the “great recession”. As businesses, non-profits, and policy makers promote STEM subjects, enrollment in the humanities is dangerously low. When introducing the iPad 2 in 2011, Steve Jobs highlighted the companionship between STEM and the humanities: “It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough — it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.” Policy makers must give languages parity with other subjects, rather than replacing them with coding languages, as some states have already done. Communities can also step up and support heritage language learning. Immigrants should be encouraged to pass their language down to their children just as much as they are encouraged to learn English themselves. The more young people learning foreign languages in school or at home, the more prepared our country will be for threats, disasters, economic opportunities, and other needs. Making language learning opportunities available to all learners — and in a wide array of languages large and small — is the first step to closing to language gap. For dominant world languages like Spanish, French, Mandarin, and yes even Russian and Arabic now, public education is capable of producing a large pool of expertise from which to pull. But it’s impossible to know which languages may be of extreme importance down the road. What about Khmer, Tamil, Somali, or Tagalog? Or even smaller, indigenous languages like Quechua or Maori? It’s simply not practical to train a team of experts in every potential language of interest. But when an earthquake strikes Nepal and relief agencies need speakers of Nepali and other regional languages of the Himalayas, it is possible to prepare quicker. While the country at large needs to invest in language education, organizations need to invest in language training. Rapidly creating and deploying specialized training materials is possible now thanks to technology — it’s what we do. Best of all, that expertise can easily be shared among other agencies, organizations, non-profits, or others trying to hurdle the language barrier. When it comes to language skills, we like to think learning from the past and making progress is a shared venture. As we’ve all heard: those who do not learn from their history are doomed to repeat it. Today more than ever, we must seek new ways to promote, teach, and share language expertise so we can be prepared for tomorrow. Originally published at blogs.transparent.com on November 19, 2018. "
https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/language-learning-is-the-educational-imperative-of-our-generation-90b4492c878f?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------,"In response to America’s language deficit, a bipartisan Congressional report has called for the country to “to value language education as a persistent national need similar to education in math or English, and to ensure that a useful level of proficiency is within every student’s reach.” In 2018, CIA Director Gina Haspel included “emphasizing foreign language excellence” as part of the agency’s core strategy. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta recently echoed — and expanded upon — that sentiment in an opinion piece for the San Francisco Chronicle. Panetta has been invested in language skills since the 1970s, when he was a member of the President’s Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies. As he points out, the Commission found that: Four decades later, the language gap has not been bridged, and public officials remain concerned. And they should be; language skills are required to navigate great challenges (and great opportunities) not only in national security, but also business and trade, diplomacy, global health, disaster preparedness and relief, and so on. In 2014, a bipartisan request from Congress to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences prompted a new study of the nation’s language education needs. In the resulting report, America’s Languages: Investing in Language Learning for the 21st Century, the Commission recommends “a national strategy to improve access to as many languages as possible for people of every region, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background — that is, to value language education as a persistent national need similar to education in math or English, and to ensure that a useful level of proficiency is within every student’s reach.” Specific recommendations in the America’s Languages report focus on expanding (and better funding) public language education: increasing the number of language teachers or supplementing through digital technology and blended learning methods; supporting and expanding heritage language programs; increasing support and creating more educational materials for Native American languages; and encouraging and providing federal financial aid for study abroad programs. A number of state and federal initiatives are aiming to meet those needs: Those efforts and others like them are promising, but it’s not enough. In a recent interview, ACTFL Executive Directory Marty Abbott explained that the language gap in the U.S. is actually getting worse and enrollment in language classes is falling. Only about 20% of American K-12 students are enrolled in language courses, compared to 92% in Europe. Abbott believes attitudes have something to do with it: While at the helm of ACTFL, she hopes to create a “new normal” in which students and parents understand that English is not enough, and that there is a link between language skills and future success. To that end, the America’s Languages report agrees. While English is on the rise on a global scale, the report acknowledges “an emerging consensus among leaders in business and politics, teachers, scientists, and community members that proficiency in English is not sufficient to meet the nation’s needs in a shrinking world, nor the needs of individual citizens who interact with other peoples and cultures more than at any other time in human history.” This consensus has a long way to spread, however. Congress is considering a bill allowing computer coding languages to fulfill foreign language requirements. Media outlets frequently report on a supposed cut-off age for language learning (even though the research they cite concludes no such thing) and publish op-eds titled Should Schools Require Foreign Languages? Doubtful. Leaders and figureheads in this country are still sending the wrong message, which, if not changed, will result in even lower enrollment rates among tomorrow’s young people. Raising awareness, which Abbott says is the number one way to improve language education in the U.S., must happen at the local level. Panetta puts the onus on parents, educators, policymakers, and leaders in business in government. Parents can pass down heritage languages, educators and policymakers can strengthen foreign language requirements and expand course offerings, and businesses can provide language training and professional development opportunities. There is another group upon whom we can rely to promote languages and cultures: public libraries. The days of libraries housing little more than books are long gone. Libraries make otherwise expensive resources freely available, preserve and organize cultural collections, and bring people and ideas together. The modern library is a linguistic and cultural community center — providing multilingual collections, programming foreign movie nights and bilingual story times, facilitating conversation groups, offering online language learning materials, and so on. These services make language learning a possibility for individuals of all ages and backgrounds and can fill gaps in a community’s K-12 language education offerings. Foreign language instruction must be a national priority, as well as an individual responsibility. Language learning is our generation’s educational imperative. If we do not instill the value of languages to today’s students and provide the means to learn them to a high degree of proficiency, tomorrow’s leaders will be facing the same language deficit that holds us back as a nation today.

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/why-do-we-still-teach-foreign-languages-as-a-separate-subject-12c27adbefdd?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"Languages aren’t used in isolation, so why do we teach them in isolation? In U.S. schools and training facilities, languages have long been taught as an individual subject — a set of words, grammar rules, and pronunciations to memorize and recall at the right moments. Not by coincidence, the U.S. has also been notoriously ineffective at producing truly multilingual students. How many students take a few years of a language only to forget it all a few years later? How many professionals take an intensive 6-week immersion course, only to memorize enough to survive but never really thrive in a foreign working environment? Of course, some direct language instruction is necessary, but a foreign language is not a subject, it’s a tool. As a recent Forbes post concludes, learners need “the chance to use language the way it was intended, as a tool for communication, not as a complex set of rules to master.” One solution to our language education crisis is cross-curricular lessons, or lessons that use language as a medium for teaching other subjects. As eSchool News notes, “beyond giving educators the chance to teach more than one discipline during a lesson, cross-curricular lessons also help students recognize the real-world application of their learned skills.” Rather than a French lesson focusing on the subjunctive, a cross-curricular lesson might require that learners discuss a current event or an ecological discovery in French, giving context to the language as a communicative tool. This isn’t an imagined concept — K-12 schools and universities around the U.S. are already doing it. In small-town Maryland, Anne Arundel County Public Schools have married languages and STEM subjects, instructing their K-5 STEM classes in Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish. Parents were hesitant at first, but young students have embraced the opportunity: “Even a non-Mandarin speaker can see that children are learning at a high level in Mandy Tang’s first-grade class at West Side. After a lesson in subtraction, the children write and illustrate their own mathematics word problems, many choosing to do so in Chinese.” The Trout Gallery at Dickinson College is tying language together with the arts, an effort that earned them the 2018 James W. Dodge Foreign Language Advocate Award. The award recognizes the gallery’s “innovative approach to language learning through a program that makes art the basis for conversation in students’ target languages.” According to the gallery director, classes use objects on display as the basis for a discussion in the target language. He applauded the program, suggesting “visual art is an effective way of developing skills for language learners.” In the STEM world, the University of Rhode Island’s engineering department offers a 5-year dual degree in engineering and a foreign language, which includes a compulsory year of studying and interning abroad. For students enrolled in the rigorous five-year dual degree in International Engineering and International Business, a term abroad at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France offers the opportunity to “explore the culture and technology environment, and communicate with their budding language skills.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection has long trained agents in Spanish, but the course was typically grammar-based. In 2006, CBP did away with its traditional Spanish course and replaced it with “Task Based Language Teaching” (TBLT) — a curriculum focused on mastering specific, job-related tasks in Spanish. The results were impressive: “Students in the task-based course were able to out-perform students in the previous grammar-based course in terms of oral accuracy, fluency, and complexity, while performing at an equivalent level in grammatical accuracy”. The agents-in-training also agreed that the course was “useful and relevant to their on-the-job Spanish needs”. At Transparent Language, our language training programs are designed to help professionals for whom language success is not optional. Our team of cohort coaches, for example, has been tasked with helping U.S. Government linguists, and translators sustain their language skills between periods of formal training. Using the CL-150, these coaches develop and distribute weekly lessons designed to push the students to their proficiency threshold. As world events dictate, coaches create and assign what we call a “MINE” lesson, or a language lesson focusing on a Major International News Event, as reported on by local news outlets. These events — economic, environmental, political, scientific, or beyond — can relate to the target culture or to a major multicultural event. For example, within 24 hours of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election, for example, MINE lessons were created and assigned to learners of 6 different languages. Using authentic, current materials gives learners the chance to experience “real” language use, while also educating them about the political or cultural climate of the region in which they operate. Cross-curricular teaching would mark a revolutionary shift in education, so it’s natural to expect some resistance. It would require significant collaboration between subject experts and language teachers, as well as sufficient teacher training. But most things worth doing are hard, right? There is one myth about cross-curricular language lessons that needs to be debunked, though. Educators, companies, or parents may fear that since students are learning in a non-native language, they may not fully understand the subject material. Can you actually learn math in Chinese if you’re still learning Chinese? Yes, you can! According to research from the University of Vienna, learners “possess the same amount of content knowledge as their peers who were taught in the [native language].” In fact, some researchers argue that “linguistic problems, rather than leading to task abandonment, often prompt intensified mental construction activity […] and better understanding of curricular concepts can occur.” In other words, learners are rising to the challenge. Simply put, contextual, communicative learning yields better results. The same research by the University of Vienna compiled numerous studies showing positive results of what they call “Content and Language Integrated Learning” (CLIL): “It is often observed that by way of CLIL students can reach significantly higher levels of [target language] than by conventional foreign language classes (Wesche 2002) and that positive effects on communicative competence are visible (e.g. Wode 1994, Klieme 2006)”. Once again, Forbes hits the nail on the head: “By de-emphasizing the focus on language itself, we may actually improve our acquisition of it, because when we stop trying to teach people about what they are saying and just start expecting them to say it, we will see far better results.” Providing language results is at the heart of the Transparent Language mission. Yes, we make language learning technology. But more importantly, we help our customers, including US Government personnel, customize and leverage that technology to create training programs to meet their proficiency needs and domain requirements. We enable a world of affordable, economical customization and swift deployment without compromising on quality or flexibility.

Even Google says so. In the last decade, American education has been increasingly concerned with promoting STEM subjects. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of students enrolled in STEM degree programs increased 36%. Then-President Obama asked Congress for a $4 billion investment in computer science in K-12 schools. States like Michigan now allow high school students to fulfill foreign language credit requirements by learning to code. Government officials in North Carolina and Kentucky have proposed defunding non-technical majors in state universities, on the basis that they “don’t get someone a job”. The Washington Post recently reported on a 2013 Google study of its hiring, firing, and promotion data since 1998. The study, called Project Oxygen, shockingly concluded that “among the eight most important qualities of Google’s top employees, STEM expertise comes in dead last.” So, what came out on top? “The seven top characteristics of success at Google are all soft skills: being a good coach; communicating and listening well; possessing insights into others (including others different values and points of view); having empathy toward and being supportive of one’s colleagues; being a good critical thinker and problem solver; and being able to make connections across complex ideas.” The majority of these soft skills are byproducts of the hard skill that continues to be put on the back burner or brushed aside entirely: learning a foreign language. Of course, the benefits and advantages afforded by foreign language study are not limited to those soft skills valued by Google and other high-tech employers. Parents, educators, and employers have many reasons to emphasize languages with the same intensity as STEM: As a tech company, we do not deny the necessity of STEM skills in the modern world. But offering scholarships or distributing state education funds based on which degrees earn money or guarantee employment (debunked by Google itself, as you now know) only narrows our tunnel vision. CNN host Fareed Zakaria agrees, arguing: “This dismissal of broad-based learning, however, comes from a fundamental misreading of the facts — and puts America on a dangerously narrow path for the future. The United States has led the world in economic dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship thanks to exactly the kind of teaching we are now told to defenestrate. A broad general education helps foster critical thinking and creativity. Exposure to a variety of fields produces synergy and cross fertilization. Yes, science and technology are crucial components of this education, but so are English and philosophy.” Particularly at younger ages — at least through high school — an introduction to the full spectrum of technical and social sciences develops the soft skills that can be harder to learn later on. Languages in particular are best started as early as possible to develop the skills and qualities so highly desired by Google. You can train coders on-the-job, but teaching empathy? Not so much. Lest you think the title of this post is using Google’s name as nothing more than a buzzword, it’s not just the internet behemoth who feels this way. According to NACE’s Job Outlook 2016 survey and the 260 employers it surveyed, important hirable attributes include “written communication skills, problem-solving skills, verbal communication skills, and a strong work ethic”. In fact, “respondents to the current survey gave slightly greater weight to verbal communication skills than was the case last year, and slightly less weight to analytical/quantitative skills.” The increased value placed on STEM degrees, unfortunately, has resulted in a decrease in value for other majors. While they value attributes associated with the social sciences and humanities, survey respondents also indicated that academic major has the most significant influence on hiring decisions. Foreign language abilities and study abroad experiences, on the other hand, wield “not much influence”. This inconsistency is massively important for educators, law makers, parents, and employers to realize. It’s time for employers to see the value of degrees in languages, philosophy, history, the arts, and beyond. Some have already noticed; billionaire investor Mark Cuban predicts “a greater demand in 10 years for liberal arts majors than […] for programming majors and maybe even engineering”. Emphasizing foreign languages and other social sciences is still relevant — critical, even — in the 21st century. As the Washington Post points out, even Steve Jobs infamously insisted STEM wouldn’t be enough. The future will require experts in “the human, cultural, and social as well as the computational.” Originally published at blogs.transparent.com on January 1, 2018. "
https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/can-foreign-languages-keep-us-safe-medically-speaking-yes-ff78ef7871fa?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"When you think about your safety, do you think about your health? There’s been a lot of talk in today’s political climate about “keeping America safe.” But safety can mean many things and be achieved in many ways. Diplomats, aid workers, doctors, scientists, businessmen and beyond all contribute to this country’s security. They don’t do it alone; their work at home and abroad hinges on their ability to communicate and collaborate with foreign counterparts. Let’s take a look at those working in global health and why their language capabilities are critical to America’s safety. One of the greatest threats to the U.S. is the rapid emergence and spread of disease — even abroad. Take the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa that claimed more than 10,000 lives. Knowing that pathogens know no borders, the UN Security Council declared the outbreak a “threat to international peace and security” and unanimously called upon member states to provide assistance and resources. That resolution received a record number of co-sponsors, with 130 countries stepping forward to provide resources and staff. With that many players in the mix, it’s not hard to see the need for better language capabilities — medical staff, aid groups, researchers, and officials all need to communicate with their counterparts from other countries. This is not an isolated event — the last decade has witnessed similar concerns with avian influenza in the U.S., MERS-CoV in the Middle East, SARS in China, and the Zika virus across Latin America, among others. Providing language training or having language professionals readily available to assist the teams researching and fighting these threats is critical to ensuring their safety and ours. Global health collaboration is not limited to disaster relief and crisis response. Scientists and researchers increasingly share their expertise and resources. As of 2008, one fifth of the medical and scientific papers had international coauthors; that number grew to one-third in 2013. This collaboration can result in new treatments, immunizations, and medicines that improve our health care system. For example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease is currently running clinical trials for a Zika virus vaccine, which it is testing with local partners and investigators at sites in Houston, Miami, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama, and Mexico. Without Spanish-speaking researchers, translators, and interpreters, this research would not be feasible. While English may be the dominant language of STEM and international research, that is a crutch on which we should not lean too heavily. We never know where a crisis may arise, or what breakthrough research might fall through the cracks because it isn’t being read by the right people. It’s also precarious to expect non-native speakers to publish complicated studies, for fear of what might be sacrificed in translation: “Chinese scientists discussing the electrical conductivity of copper nanotubes in a 2007 Royal Society of Chemistry paper, for example, chose a rather unfortunate acronym for the subject of their study. (It rhymes with “runt.”) The acronym has stuck: A new study from this year in Science China, an English-language journal, uses the shorthand — innocuous to people who don’t know English slang and amusing for culturally immersed Anglophones, but hardly helpful for scientists wishing to be taken seriously.” Institutions, academics, and experts already understand the need for better language capacity in global health. The National Institute of Health now offers resources for researchers in Spanish and in Asian languages, and major U.S. universities are designing degree programs and courses that emphasize languages in the context of global health. Duke University, for example, offers Voices in Global Health courses in Arabic, French, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish — with more languages to come. The program director highlights the importance of language and cultural competency in global health care: “We actively turn our ear to the populations we study. Instead of talking about them, we are listening to them, which greatly enriches our understanding of the issues.” These issues — outbreaks, drug-resistant illnesses, poor sanitation, and even environmental health concerns — represent a great threat to the global community. America has a vested interest in contributing to global health efforts to keep its citizens healthy and safe. To do so most effectively, local languages and cultural competency must not be an afterthought, but a thought on the tip of our tongues. Tackling these issues is one of the many reasons why Transparent Language is transforming the economics of language training and fighting the government’s language deficit.

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/the-secret-to-learning-languages-or-anything-really-consistency-is-king-c81606ef7a14?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"An object in motion stays in motion. That’s no secret, it’s called momentum. But how do you build momentum in your language studies? Consistency keeps you moving forward. Learning in short bursts every day does two things. It creates the habit — which beats motivation (the lack thereof, really) — and keeps the language fresh in your mind. When you start skipping days, you’re more likely to make excuses and skip even more. It also puts more time between what you’ve studied and what you actually remember, meaning more material to review before you can move on to the new stuff. There is a lot of advice out there about how to be consistent and form good study habits — learn at the same time each day, set up a distraction-free study space, and so on. For most people, those aren’t realistic with work, family, and other obligations beckoning. Here are a few strategies that anyone can implement to become more consistent: 1. Don’t fight your existing routine — build upon it with “if-then” planning. Dozens of studies confirm that “deciding in advance when and where you will take specific actions to reach your goal […] can double or triple your chances for success.” Our brains are wired to encode information in terms of x and y (if X, then Y), so approach your goals this way to make sure you’re fitting in time for a little language every day: 2. Set powerful reminders. An alarm clock or an Outlook meeting reminder that can easily be turned off or ignored is not a good enough reminder when you’re just starting to form a habit. Link your reminder to something you do or experience every day so you can’t get away from it. Switch your phone (or your Facebook profile, to start) into the target language. Each time you check your phone (or your Facebook), you’ll be reminded that you need to put in your 15–20 minutes. 3. Eliminate choice paralysis. Just like setting a specific time/place to study, you should know what you want to study. It’s the same concept as packing a gym bag the night before; have everything you need on hand so there’s never an excuse to skip or change your mind. The less prep work you have to do when the time comes to study, the less likely you will be to gaff it off. 4. Get in the habit of starting over. Being consistent is its own reward — that’s why it’s so hard to start again when we falter. Don’t fall in to the trap of being discouraged when you miss a day. Hold yourself accountable (or ask someone else to do so) and get back to it; pay a fine (or make a donation) when you miss a day, and double it for each consecutive day you fail to get back in line. Announce your progress on social media or find a partner with whom you can learn. All of these sources of external motivation will help you start over again when your internal motivation slips. Consistency is king. Start slow, choose manageable daily goals, and keep these best practices in mind. Most of all, don’t forget that even slow progress is still forward momentum.

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/stop-telling-people-to-learn-a-language-fed8290bbe7c?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"They absolutely should, but let’s encourage them a bit differently. After all, as we language lovers know, wording matters. The advantages of knowing a second language are many: improved tolerance, decreased risk of dementia, better performance in other subject areas, and a slew of other social and cognitive benefits. In these tumultuous times, a recent article even hailed learning another language as “one of the most effective things you can do to take action,” because it helps you better understand your own culture and empathize with others. In fact, this recommendation to learn a language has been pouring in from many sources. We should be careful not to sell these benefits as the benefits of bilingualism. While some of these benefits may require a certain level of proficiency or may have an expiration date — a 75-year-old just dabbling into German for the first time probably won’t be staving off cognitive decline — it’s never too late to be a little more tolerant or to see the world from a new perspective. That’s exactly why everyone should invest time in another language. It’s also exactly why we should stop telling people to simply learn another language. My problem with that imperative is twofold. First, that wording implies that a language is something that can be acquired and mastered like the multiplication tables or the fifty state capitals. When it comes to languages, there’s always more to learn. Second, and more importantly, it can also be a daunting word choice for those starting at zero, for whom having “learned” a language is a long way away. After 15 years of studying 3 different languages to varying degrees of proficiency, I can say with authority that you don’t have to master a language to reap its many benefits. Speaking at the C2 level is admirable, truly, but it’s not necessary to form a relationship with a stranger or see things from their perspective. Often it is in the moments when I’m struggling most with a language that I can feel that increased empathy or improved tolerance that we talk so much about in bilinguals. It’s not until you try to ask if someone is hurt, but accidentally ask if they’re ice cream (“Esta herido?” vs. “Esta helado?” for the Spanish speakers among us), that you realize how hard it is not to be able to express yourself despite your best efforts. Learning a language to any level is hard, but there is value in the attempt. Learning even one word, such as “Insha’Allah” in Arabic, can open a window into a new culture. This ubiquitous Arabic expression means “God willing” and indicates their belief that God’s will supersedes human will and that nothing will happen unless God wills it to be so. Even when making dinner plans, it’s common to be met with an “Insha’Allah” instead of an “I’ll see you there at 7.” That one expression opens your eyes to a whole new way of thinking, doesn’t it? So, I propose we stop telling people they need to “learn a language”, because most of them will write that off before they even try. It’s akin to selling the benefits of running by telling someone to run a marathon. Start with a 5k first. Just because you’re not running 26.2 miles doesn’t mean it’s not good for your health. We should encourage people to start small, to be a student of language. Strive for 15–20 minutes a day. Study just enough to order at a restaurant during your next vacation, or enough to say hello and greet a newcomer in your country. These small accomplishments not only provide immense satisfaction, but also start to unlock the many benefits of speaking another language and experiencing another culture. Those who set realistic goals are more likely to achieve them — and continue past them — than those who set out to simply “learn the language.” Ready to get started, one day at a time?

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/can-borrowing-words-from-other-languages-unlock-new-thoughts-and-feelings-972846f70c7?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"While languages are constantly evolving, they are also reflecting the community and systems they are spoken in. Perhaps one of the most well-known examples of a language expanding in terminology to suit the practical needs of its speakers, is within the various Inuit dialects and their many ways of referencing and categorizing snow. Not every language necessarily can put such a large lexicon of snow references to good use. However, there are plenty of concepts which are universally common and take on deeper, more specific meanings, depending on what language you are using. Just like any language, English lacks words to describe particular thoughts and feelings — lexical gaps that are easy to miss. We’ve all felt emotions that we can’t quite put into a single word, yet there is a good chance another language out there probably can. Expressing love, for example, may seem straightforward in one sense. The ways in which languages verbally interpret love, though, can vary hugely. Take a familiar boy-meets-girl scenario often depicted in teen films: Two people’s eyes meet, they yearn to initiate something but are both afraid of doing so. Rather than keeping this awkward scenario pent up inside them, a speaker of Yágan in Tierra del Fuego could call this ‘mamihlapinatapai’. By the time one of them does (hopefully) make the first move, assuming the pair hit it off, they will begin to experience the sensation of first falling in love which Norwegians handily call ‘forelsket’. As the romance grows, so too does their time spent together, it may even get to the stage where being apart from each other evokes a strong emotional pain that Hindi speakers refer to as ‘viraag’. Once the ‘viraag’ has become all too much to handle, and the lovestruck guy drives over to the girl’s house, an Inuit speaker would call the sense of anticipation in eagerly awaiting someone to arrive at their home ‘iktsuarpok’. Fast forward fifty years after a lifetime together, where neither of the couple can imagine life without the other, a romantic sentiment in itself, but they could go one further by adopting the Arabic term ya’burnee. This translates literally as ‘you bury me’ and expresses the hope of dying before their partner, to avoid the pain of enduring a life without them. The act of gazing vacantly into the distance without any thoughts taking hold has a name in Japanese called ‘boketto’. In Chinese, the sense of perfection or accomplishment after a job well done is known as ‘yuan bei’. Being able to cognitively empathise with someone’s thoughts without even saying a word is called ‘mitdenken’ by German speakers. All of the words mentioned so far have a broadly feel-good sense about them, and research suggests harnessing the power of positive foreign terms in our own everyday language could even improve our personal well-being. However, it isn’t only the positive lexicography that is sometimes missing in our vocabularies. A deep, grief-stricken homesickness for a departed entity is coined in Welsh as ‘hiraeth’. Russian speakers use the term ‘toska’ to describe an aching of the soul over a completely unknown cause. Melancholic longing for something (or someone) that might never return to us is simply called ‘saudade’ in Portuguese. Although expanding your vocabulary in this way is unlikely to take you on a journey of emotional discovery, it does help us appreciate just how nuanced languages can be in their evolution and understanding of human feelings.

https://medium.com/@TransparentLanguage/can-we-bridge-the-digital-language-divide-35188387596b?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------,"Caught in the struggle between globalization and linguistic diversity, speakers of endangered and minority languages are struggling to bridge the digital language divide and reap the benefits of the Internet and all it has to offer. Probably once a week I Google a question that seems so stupid and obvious I’m embarrassed to ask my friends. Gems from my recent search history include “will my radiator start a fire if there’s lots of dust on it”, “how long can you leave cooked chicken in the fridge before it goes bad”, and “how to make an appointment at the Dutch immigration service”. Thankfully, sites like Wikipedia and Quora speak my language, meet me on my own cultural terms, and offer a wealth of material to compensate for my typically Millennial lack of domestic skills or basic life knowledge. But that’s not true for everyone. Where you and I turn to Google for everything from voter registration information to misdiagnosing our cold symptoms for an obscure tropical disease, the hundreds of millions of people around the world who don’t speak digitally dominant languages like English, French, Chinese, or Japanese are still cut off from benefiting from the rest of the world’s knowledge. Since the rise of the Internet throughout the early 2000s, we’ve heard more and more about the ‘digital divide‘, the technological gap between the haves and have-nots that kept people in some of the world’s poorer and more remote regions from reaping the full benefits of the 21st century’s great information democratization. What we tend to hear about less is the language divide that coincides with it, and how we can close that divide. Getting online has been shown time and time again to be one of the best ways to fight poverty across the world: it improves public health, increases educational outcomes, and equips citizens to better hold their governments accountable. That said, you’d think the solution is simple: just wire every school in Burkina Faso with broadband and dump enough laptops over Peru and bam, no more poverty. But it turns out, lack of access to technology isn’t the only or even the biggest obstacle to getting marginalized communities across the world connected. According to a study by GSMA, around 320 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and another 120 million in North Africa who are covered by mobile broadband don’t use it, commonly citing “lack of locally relevant content” as the main reason for their lack of Internet engagement. According to the GSMA report, this is because “content is not catering to the rich variety of cultures and languages across the continent.” In a region of the world where only 40% of people speak languages like English, French, and Portuguese that are popular on the Internet, this leaves the majority in the digital dark. So we find ourselves in a situation in 2016 in which, despite the fact that many of the world’s poor can afford smartphones and live in areas with mobile data coverage, life-saving information is often all Greek to those who need it most. If technology and infrastructure aren’t the solution, then what is? Experts from across the developing world are building a consensus on bridging the divide, and it starts with personal, societal, economic, and technological investment in minority and indigenous languages. The long-term solution to closing the digital language divide is investing in the learning of and literacy in the endangered, indigenous, and minority languages that most people in multicultural, multilingual countries like India, Cameroon, and Bolivia speak at home. In Nigeria, public schools typically use only English as the medium of instruction. Despite a famously successful six-year experiment with mother-tongue instruction in Nigeria in the 1970s, government inertia and a belief that English is the most important language for the global economy have stalled any changes in education in the country whose people speak over 500 different languages in their homes and communities. This is a challenge first and foremost because children learn best in their mother tongue. In Nigeria, this policy not only affects overall educational outcomes, but also further exacerbates the digital language divide, creating “digital ghettos” and isolating linguistic communities that are already on the margin and stand the most to gain from increased availability of information. Instead, Nigerian public officials could look to South Africa for a better model of multilingual education that privileges both the mother tongue and the national language. There, students typically spend their first three years of school learning in their mother tongue, switching to English in the fourth grade, and educational experts are pushing for a full six years of native language education. Coupled with initiatives supporting indigenous-language media, South Africa is making strides towards bridging its own digital language divide. Where smart language policy and innovative technology meet, we’re starting to see some of the sturdiest bridges for crossing the digital language divide. While national governments are sometimes slow in reacting to linguistic needs, partnerships between civil society organizations and private tech companies can often work quickly and innovatively to help promote native language learning and literacy and close the digital language divide. Transparent Language donates its technology via 7000 Languages, contributing to the preservation and promotion of marginalized and under-resourced languages. One such 7000 Languages partnership is with BasaBali, an organization fighting to promote Balinese, a minority language in Indonesia. After a pilot project with 12 middle schools in the area of Den Pasar, the Balinese capital, the Department of Communication recommended that all schools in the area use the same technology to teach Balinese in the classroom and in extracurricular activities. Alongside classroom-based efforts like these, BasaBali is working to ensure that technology provides the Balinese language a “bridge to the future”: together with a team of linguists they’ve produced the BASAbaliWiki, a Balinese-Indonesian-English online dictionary that can be edited by members of the Balinese-speaking community. Projects like these can have great impact, but individual language learners and enthusiasts can also do their part towards bringing marginalized languages into the digital fold. Learners with an interest in development, anthropology, or language policy can also contribute towards closing the digital language divide in a few different ways: The value in learning less commonly taught languages goes far beyond activism and preservation, but it’s an important first step in bridging the digital language divide and helping usher communities across the world into a prosperous 21st century.

https://medium.com/reach-up/this-athlete-s-confidence-is-the-driving-force-behind-her-success-2f82c6233a99?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------,"It’s an hour before Caelyn Griffith is scheduled to compete and the petite 20-year-old stands quietly among the bustle that surrounds her. Coaches and volunteers make last-minute makeup and wardrobe fixes and wrangle excited athletes into lines for their grand entrance into UCLA’s John Wooden Center. An enthusiastic crowd awaits. Wearing a sparkling turquoise-and-black leotard with a large pink flower design splashed across the center, Caelyn looks down for a moment. Her cheeks are adorned with stick-on rhinestones and her light brown hair is pulled back with a glittery scrunchy. She pushes her glasses back into place as she looks around the room. Still maintaining her reserve, Caelyn follows the other competitors into the gymnasium. As she looks up into packed bleachers, Caelyn smiles brightly. She begins waving eagerly once she sees the dozens of friends and family members among the crowd, who are standing and calling her name. One of her coaches, Jennifer Hitt, describes Caelyn’s athleticism in one word: showmanship. “She’s got the personality,” Hitt says. “She has a pure joy for her routines.” Even before she joined the Special Olympics 10 years ago, the Los Angeles-area resident loved doing gymnastics. But her participation in the worldwide sports organization has also boosted Caelyn’s confidence, says her mother, Clausine Griffith-Honda. Caelyn’s self-assuredness in gymnastics has carried over into other areas of her life, too. She has graduated high school and is preparing to apply to Taft College, a community college near Bakersfield that has a “Transition to Independent Living Program” for adults with intellectual disabilities. Caelyn is fairly self-sufficient, her mom says. She goes to the mall with friends, hangs out with her boyfriend and has held a few different jobs. She also likes to dance and listen to music. “I like pop and country,” Caelyn says. “I like Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus.” When she prepares for competition, Caelyn remembers to keep a good attitude. Her cheerful focus is on display during her competitions at the World Games. Participating in the artistic gymnastics category, Caelyn has four events: uneven bars, balance beam, vault and floor routine. During her balance beam routine, the hushed crowd watches as Caelyn carefully high-steps along the padded stretch of wood, just a few inches off the ground. When the gymnast briefly pauses, the voices of her local teammates pierce the silence. “Come on Caelyn, you can do this!” they yell. “Concentrate!” After her dismount, Caelyn’s serious expression turns to elation as she throws her hands up in the customary “Reach Up” celebratory pose. Excitedly, she waves to the crowd and high-fives her coach. At an awards ceremony held later in the day at UCLA’s Wilson Plaza, Caelyn is presented with a bronze medal for her balance beam performance. She then goes on to nail her uneven bar routine, which includes holding a pose for a few seconds — her arms tight at her side, her chin in the air, her legs pointing back — before doing a spin and dismounting. Caelyn also makes solid landings during her vault jumps and entertains the crowd for her floor performance dance, which is set to Joan Jett’s “I Love Rock and Roll.” Between events, Caelyn chats animatedly with the coaches and other athletes. When the competition is over, she steals a quick hug from her mom and poses for photos with friends and fans. Then, she is ushered away to do an interview with ESPN. “She’s very social,” her mom says. The floor routine was her favorite event. “It allows me to show my personality, pizzazz and sassiness!” Caelyn says. Caelyn earns a fifth-place medal for the routine, and when it’s placed around her neck, she beams as if she’s won the gold. She showed similar pride when given an eighth-place medal for her vault performance. She takes center stage when medals are given out in her division for the uneven bars, and the crowd cheers as her name is called and the gold is placed around her neck. Caelyn and the other medal winners raise their hands to the sky to the sound of applause. Before the competition, Caelyn’s mom said it doesn’t matter to her daughter where she places. The affirmation and support of others gives Caelyn what she needs. “All these people are screaming and calling her name,” her mom says.” “Everything she came for has already happened.” "

Kirk Wint lines up on the starting line in his Jamaica track uniform, taking a moment to wave to the crowd in the stands. We all cheer as Kirk’s physical presence releases incredible anticipation and exuberant joy. He is fueling himself, and us, for the incredible feat we are about to experience. A few minutes earlier, Kirk was pushed to the starting line in a wheelchair. He was lifted from it and placed slowly on the ground. When the shotgun goes off, unable to use his legs, Kirk runs the 50-meter race using his hands. Running alongside three other athletes, Kirk tucks his legs under his torso and propels himself forward with his arms. He finishes the race a few moments behind the others. The crowd cheers, and the race is over. What happens after Kirk crosses the finish line quietly opposes his entrance. His coaches help him back into his wheelchair, and he is calmly ushered away. The moment has no fanfare. There is no explanation or extra attention given to Kirk’s extraordinary achievement. He, like every other athlete participating in the World Games, is simply using his passion and courage to compete to the best of his abilities. Kirk is one of countless Special Olympics athletes who are challenging how spectators understand this one word: ability. Their performances ask us to consider: I want to personally thank Kirk Wint for his stunning portrayal of ability. For challenging my own imagination of what is possible. For his commitment to compete and do his best no matter the circumstances and no matter the results. I want to thank Kirk for showing up with a contagious happiness and an unwavering spirit. I do not know more of Kirk’s story. I only know that he is an athlete from Jamaica who runs using his hands. But I do know that after watching him compete, I will never be the same.

https://medium.com/reach-up/athletic-equality-for-all-199265cd95e6?source=collection_home---6------2-----------------------,"Not many people can say they wake up to the sound of a blaring alarm at 3 a.m., seven days a week. But then again, not many people have the determination of Noah Dellas. On July 26, 2015, the Special Olympics World Games hosted the first official triathlon event in Long Beach, California. Its winner was 17-year-old Noah Dellas, who finished the race in one hour and twelve minutes. He was the first out of the water and held a pace faster than seven minutes per mile for the entire run. Leading up to this competition, he was training tirelessly every single day to make that happen. As a New Jersey native, Noah has had prime training opportunities. His coach, Lisa Rumer, is also the coach to three other World Games triathlon participants: Benjamin Heitmeyer, Amy Noctor and Courtney Dreyfus, who all medaled in their respective divisions as well. They’re no strangers to the competition, too, since it premiered as a demonstration race at the 2014 U.S.A. Games in their home state of New Jersey. In those same Games, the New Jersey athletes took home 305 medals, and 136 of those were gold. What followed those Games was a huge step for people with intellectual disabilities. On June 19, 2014, using the National Games as a driving force, New Jersey State Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Governor Chris Christie helped pass a law saying that all schools in the state must make an effort to include Unified Sports. New Jersey is setting an example. It’s one of inclusion, support, and acknowledging ability in all. And it’s a message that needs to be spread. A recent study of National Special Olympics programs says that 67 percent of athletes initially get involved through school-based programs. It also says that when asked why they stopped being a part of Special Olympics, most athletes admit that it was because the program was no longer supported or present at their school or that they couldn’t get enough information. Even more crucial, only 30 percent of those involved say that they did any organized sports before joining a Special Olympics program. By ensuring that schools have Unified Sports, we assure that athletes are getting a chance to be truly included. Furthermore, the report says that the typical Special Olympics athlete participates for 11 years or more, which is the same average participation length as an athlete without an intellectual disability. Special Olympics athletes are just as committed, determined, and passionate as any other athlete. They are competitive, supportive teammates and they are ready to work for every bit of their success. The only thing that ever holds them back is the opportunity for involvement. Noah Dellas has dreams of being the best triathlete, not just the best triathlete with an intellectual disability. He’s got the will, the resources, and the training to make that happen. And he will certainly be someone to watch as he continues competing. Stories like Noah’s don’t have to be an exception. They should be the rule. Unified Sports can help make that happen. This publication is curated by Special Olympics World Games Los Angeles 2015.

https://medium.com/reach-up/going-with-the-wind-while-striving-for-the-gold-b6cf59c8f89b?source=collection_home---6------4-----------------------,"When Michael Crofton and John Kirkland compete in the Special Olympics World Games on July 30, there will be plenty of challenges on the horizon. This will be their first World Games as a team, and their first time to Los Angeles. While they have sailed in the ocean, they’ve never sailed in the Pacific. And although they usually steer a catamaran on a lake in their home state of Georgia, the World Games requires the use of a boat with a single hull. But they probably have a joke for all of that. “We always want to do our best, but we don’t want to let the tension build up to where it’s overwhelming,” Kirkland said. Kirkland, 28, and Crofton, 33, share an easygoing attitude that works well with the unpredictability of the wind. When they meet with about a dozen other athletes and Unified partners on Lake Tobesofkee in Macon for practice, there are times when the wind is on their side. In those cases, Crofton is at the front of the boat controlling the jib sail as Kirkland steers and helms the main sail. Both men listen attentively to the other in order to coordinate their speed and direction. When the air is still, and there are no ripples on the water, that’s when the mood changes from serious to lighthearted. “If there’s a lot of wind, you get to have a blast and sail — sail fast, and sail well. If there’s not that much wind, then you get to hang out and talk,” Kirkland said. Discussion can vary from motorcycles and cars to punch lines with animal sounds. There are also the many times they’ve jokingly recreated the famous Titanic scene by yelling out, “I’m flying!” with their arms outstretched. According to their assistant coach, Debbie Parrish, it’s this type of brotherly friendship that makes their teamwork so effective. “John is a really nice guy, he’s really awesome. He learned sailing from me,” Crofton said, laughing. Crofton has been involved with Special Olympics since he was three years old, and he’s competed as an athlete in events ranging from swimming and boxing to bowling and tennis. He learned how to sail five years ago, and considers this sport to be his favorite. His Unified partner (a teammate without intellectual disability) became a volunteer in 2013, after he and some friends saw the sailboats on Lake Tobesofkee and he was curious enough to ask about them. So, maybe Crofton’s joke about teaching Kirkland isn’t too far off. When they speak about the upcoming World Games, Kirkland and Crofton list their goals in relation to the other person’s happiness. Crofton is excited to make new friends, but he also wants his teammate to have fun. Kirkland said that he’s working hard to make sure that Crofton has a lifelong memory. Both joke about what it would be like to win. “We do it together. That’s what a team is all about,” Crofton said. This story originally appeared in Ability Magazine.

https://medium.com/reach-up/a-valuable-lesson-we-all-need-to-learn-ac741834ad?source=collection_home---6------5-----------------------,"“You can do this Brittany. You can do it.” That’s what Special Olympics powerlifter Brittany Tregarthen wants her friends and family to say when they watch her compete at the Special Olympics World Games. And while she says that the support might make her nervous, it also makes her incredibly excited and proud. Brittany is an impressive powerlifter who can squat 150 pounds, and she has competed in many different Special Olympics sports. But she has more than just athletic feats to boast. She is a 2007 graduate of the Vision Program at Delta High School in Colorado. She is a powerful public speaker. She helped co-write a book alongside her mother, and furthermore, she is an incredible lyricist. There is no doubt that Brittany’s talents and work ethic are exceptional. When I spoke to her mom, Suzanne, she told me that one of Brittany’s biggest struggles is choosing one goal to work on at a time. Even in my brief conversation with Brittany, I instantly detected her desire to do remarkable things, specifically in powerlifting and music. Brittany teaches us how we should see those with intellectual disabilities. Why would we ever underestimate someone with intellectual disabilities when people like Brittany constantly prove their determination for greatness? When we asked Suzanne to tell us the most joyful part about raising Brittany, she sighed a bit before saying “all of it.” She went on to describe how proud she is of the woman that Brittany has become, but she was quick to add that she feels that way about all of her children. As a loving mother, it does not make a difference if a child has an intellectual disability or does not. Suzanne knows that all children are equal. It’s a lesson we all should believe in: people are capable whether or not they have intellectual disabilities. People with intellectual disabilities deserve this, and it is our responsibility to take on a mindset that gives it to them. All Brittany Tregarthen wants to hear her family and friends say during the World Games is “You can do it.” And then, judging by her record of success, she will.

https://medium.com/reach-up/the-true-meaning-of-team-on-display-at-the-special-olympics-world-games-7d86186d3868?source=collection_home---6------6-----------------------,"Camaraderie. Abel Mehari and his teammates on USA Minnesota rely on camaraderie to succeed on the basketball court. To successfully execute a play, score a basket, and win a game, the trust and kinship between teammates are vital. But Mehari knows that the camaraderie goes much farther than just the bond he shares with his teammates and coaches. It exists between all the athletes participating in the Special Olympics World Games. “It’s been a pretty humbling experience playing with other athletes around the world who have been dealing with the same personal problems I went through. Being in that Opening Ceremony and watching [everyone] giving us their support, really was a heart-warming experience not just for the United States, but also for all the other countries around the world.” The camaraderie Mehari experiences through competing in the Special Olympics, however, have not been a consistent experience throughout his life. Mehari’s parents immigrated to the United States from Eritrea in 1989, and he was born in America in 1992. Between the ages of two and four, his parents found out he had an intellectual disability. In school, kids would bully him during class and recess. It wasn’t until he started playing basketball and joined his Special Olympics team that Mehari felt the spirit of inclusion and became motivated to be the best person he could be. Team USA Minnesota Coach James Parrish says he has watched Mehari develop into a strong competitor and man. “Coaching Abel has been awesome. It’s been great to watch him grow from just four years ago- his abilities, his maturity level and growing up, and having him and my son [Unified Partner Averazse Parrish] be able to play on the same team has been fantastic.” Mehari’s journey with Special Olympics has brought him many opportunities. This year, Mehari participated in the NBA All-Star weekend NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Game in New York City, where he played with current and past NBA and WNBA greats, including Steph Curry, Tamika Catchings, and “Dream Team” Olympian Chris Mullin. Mehari said he learned a great deal about the game of basketball from his star-studded teammates, and even received memorable advice from Mullin. “He told me to be confident within yourself and don’t be afraid to fail, and that’s what I’ve learned. I still will get on him for calling me borderline cocky in the ESPN interview, but he is a great guy, a Hall of Famer and somebody to look up to.” While Mehari and his USA Minnesota teammates have their sights set on the gold, he said the most important part of participating in the Special Olympics World Games is to relax and have fun. “When we’re having fun everyone is cheering for each other and we’re doing all the little things. If we’re not having fun, then we don’t do well. The most important thing is to get out there and have fun.” To cheer for Mehari and the other 6,5000 athletes at the this week’s World Games in Los Angeles, visit LA2015.org/schedule. "

Now she was in the stands at the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, grooving to music courtesy of Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys. For her mom, Shelly Hall, the best moment of the Special Olympics Opening Ceremony was at the end, when the flaming torch made its way up the ceremonial red carpet to the Special Olympics cauldron. Her daughter, who plays basketball, wasn’t competing in the World Games, but the family made the trip to witness the nine-day event, which celebrates the achievements of people with intellectual disabilities. “I liked the torch,” Hall said. “It involved so many people and groups and communities in every state. That moment felt empowering. It was the unifying end to it. Special Olympic athlete Hannah Hall, 16, surrounded by family and friends at the July 25 World Games Opening Ceremony. There was something for everybody at the star-studded Opening Ceremony on July 25, which drew more than 60,000 fans who gave an exuberant welcome to the 6,500 participating athletes and their coaches that descended on the City of Angels from 165 countries for the world’s largest sporting and humanitarian event this year. Luminaries celebrating the commencement of the World Games included First Lady Michelle Obama, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver, comedian Jimmy Kimmel, Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts and actresses Lauren Potter and Eva Longoria. The list of entertainers was equally impressive: Stevie Wonder, Cody Simpson and Avril Lavigne headlined the three-hour event, which also featured pop singer Nicole Scherzinger, rock band O.A.R., Latin superstar J Balvin, country singer Cassadee Pope, and Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett, who wrote the Games “Reach Up LA” theme song. Special Olympics athlete Justin King, who is competing with Canada’s soccer team, said he loved the high-energy event. “It was fun,” King said. Produced by FiveCurrents, the creative team behind the opening ceremonies of the Sochi 2014 and London 2012 Olympic Games, the sold-out Opening Ceremony was directed by Emmy Award-winner Debbie Allen. Los Angeles resident Adrienne Thompson said the evening’s closing dance performance, featuring dozens of young people waving colorful flags as they moved, was a memorable moment. “It created such an environment of harmony,” Thompson said. “I think it brought everyone together in that moment.” Her son, Roman Thompson, said the speeches made an impact on him, particularly Mayor Garcetti, who spoke about the diversity of Los Angeles and the way the Games’ unifying spirit helped people to “know what it feels like to be one single human family.” “He just dropped quote after quote,” Roman Thompson said. Fellow Los Angeles resident Stacy Hundleys liked hearing from Maria Shriver, the daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics. “[My mom] was so proud of you and wanted more than anything for you to be respected, valued, appreciated for who you are,” Shriver said to the athletes. Olympic legends Greg Louganis, Michael Phelps and Michelle Kwan helped fete their Special Olympic peers by carrying in the Special Olympics flag. The evening ended with an explosion of fireworks filling the night sky. After the event, Slava Sidorenko, 27, from Kazakhstan, waited with teammates for a bus back to their hotel. This is the gymnast’s first World Games — and his only time on an airplane. He spoke through an interpreter but his lingering excitement needed no translation. “He likes the fireworks and also the concert,” the interpreter said. “He says it was very beautiful.” Lalfakzuala Thanghmingliana, 21, a soccer player from India, was similarly delighted. “The ceremony was great,” he said, smiling as he paused. “This is the best day.” To find out more about attending the Special Olympic World Games, visit LA2015.org/schedule.

https://medium.com/reach-up/a-fair-and-fighting-chance-152499d15fcf?source=collection_home---6------8-----------------------,"Hien spent eight years of his life chained to a pole on a street in the middle of town. He wasn’t spoken to, and he didn’t speak. His crime was noted as “turbulence,” or having an intellectual disability. His jailer was centuries-old misunderstandings of intellectual disabilities. Upon hearing of Hien’s condition from a politician who had visited the area, a Special Olympics staffer traveled for 24 hours to investigate, and hopefully, to help. When the staffer arrived and spoke to his mother, she found what she often finds at the root of situations like Hien’s: fear, and perhaps more essentially, misunderstanding. This fear and misunderstanding was so powerful and so palpable that it led to a little boy being publicly manacled for simply being different. Stories like Hien’s are shocking. It’s easy to be angry with his mother and with his village, but that is an unproductive anger, one that does not cast fair blame or target this ancient problem at the source. In Greek and Roman antiquity, the status quo was both ruthless in its reverence to logic and entirely irrational in its fear of any deviation from the norm. The pre-Modern world often saw persons born with intellectual disabilities as not “human” enough to save. While this apathy was cold and cruel towards such individuals, it was far preferable to the superstition which took over with the advent of the Middle Ages. As Mojdeh Bayat, an associate professor at DePaul University and author of the academic article “Understanding View of Disability in the Cote d’Ivoire,” says, “the views of disability in the West have ranged from individuals with disabilities being considered evil in the middle ages, idiots and objects of pity in the late nineteenth century, and, finally, as being an equal part of a diverse global human society in more recent years.” However, Bayat’s final assertion that we have achieved an egalitarian society has barely been realized in certain global spaces. Even in the most progressive regions, inclusion is often merely tolerated instead of wholeheartedly embraced. In areas with immense access to science and diverse stories, some individuals still regard people with intellectual disabilities as second-class citizens. Yet even in regions where the stigma of intellectual disabilities is far more prevalent due to that fear and misunderstanding, we can still rely on extraordinary individuals to step up for what is right. Eighteen years ago, a Senegalese woman noticed that one little girl would come play with her grandchildren every day, only to wander off with no one to care for her. Despite being a toddler who had an intellectual disability, the little girl returned alone to play with the woman’s grandchildren day after day. On the sixth day of her observation, the woman followed the little girl, Awa, back to her home. She was surprised to find that Awa had a mother. Even more surprising, however, was her mother’s response to the woman’s concerns that the two-year-old was walking around the streets unsupervised. “Why do you care for her? She’s not normal,” said the mother to the inquiring woman. Struck with sorrow for young Awa, the woman adopted the girl, whose father refused to recognize his daughter because of her intellectual disability. In school, which Awa’s adopted mother paid for although it was not compulsory, Awa was introduced to Special Olympics. Because Awa was able to socialize through her education, as well as in her inclusion into the Special Olympics, she gained new friends and new hobbies. Today at age 20, Awa Giakhate will attend the Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles, representing Senegal in table tennis. Awa was lucky to find a family and a calling through school. But so many children with intellectual disabilities can never receive an education, let alone participate in socialization, because of a lack of governmental funding. While the UNESCO Salamanca Statement, passed in 1994, calls upon all governments to prioritize inclusive education for students with special educational needs, not all governments do so. For instance, in Hien’s home country of Cote d’Ivoire education for people with intellectual disabilities is largely funded by NGOs and charities instead of the government. When free education is not a right, or when governments fail to fund or legally assist individuals with disabilities to attend school, society loses a vital aspect toward the normalization and acceptance of these differences. But even in legal situations where individuals with intellectual disabilities are granted access into a school system, there are still obstacles to face: societal persecution that can halt their ability to gain a true education at all. For example, Ankush Saha has a disorder that causes seizures as well as intellectual disabilities, and he recalls severe social ostracization in school that included teachers who slapped him on occasion. Today he is a golfer, and he is also planning to attend the Special Olympics World Games this summer on behalf of India. Through Special Olympics, Awa and Ankush have been able to find hope amid cultural adversity. Eventually, Hien had the same opportunity. When the Special Olympics staffer sat down with Hien’s mother, she explained that a child like Hien deserved extra love and attention, not shame and isolation. At first, his mother didn’t understand why anyone would care for her child. In her words, he was “not human.” Over time, as conversations with Hien’s mother continued, the Special Olympics staffer was able to convince the village to remove Hien from his shackles. Slowly the hearts and minds of the people of Hien’s village began to change. Today, in that same village, children with and without intellectual disabilities play together on a Special Olympics football team. There needs to be more stories that end like this one, but if we are to make any progress at all, we must be willing to stare at the source of the stigma that has defined the lives of too many. We need to understand the reality of what life is like for the millions of people around the world with intellectual disabilities. And then, we need to change it for the better. We owe it to Ankush, to Awa, to Hien and to every other person with a disability who has ever suffered under a culture of oppression. Otherwise, we are bystanders and equally complicit in the grievances against people with disabilities.

https://medium.com/reach-up/the-kornhauser-clan-c4f6adf4eb7f?source=collection_home---6------9-----------------------,"More than intelligence, ability, luck or good looks, nothing determines success and achievement more than a single quality known as grit. Defined by psychologist Angela Duckworth as having “passion and perseverance for very long-term goals,” grit involves “living life like it’s a marathon, not a sprint.” In the face of a medical prognosis proclaiming that she would likely never even walk, no one has demonstrated grit like Special Olympics athlete Lin Kornhauser and her tenacious family. Born in Israel, Lin had extremely weak muscles that rendered her unable to hold up her own head. Her parents struggled with the doctors’ fatalist declaration of Lin’s destiny. A friend suggested that they bring Lin to Special Olympics Israel events. The Kornhauser clan lives in the small city of Ra’anana, located in the heart of the biblically significant Sharon plain of Israel. Ra’anana has a population of 80,000, 10 percent of that of Jerusalem. In order for Lin to attend Special Olympics practices, the Kornhausers must drive her to much larger cities. Yet they have found the 2,000 miles of driving per month more than worth it. Even though Lin began her journey with Special Olympics unable to hold up her own head, her tenacity with athletics slowly but surely gave her more strength, balance, dexterity and a sense of independence. Finding her niche and her passion, Lin’s growth was exponential. Against all odds, she took on not one, but four sports in Special Olympics, including table tennis, tennis, swimming and bowling. Seeing Lin thrive under the spirit of competition and inclusion of Special Olympics, the entire Kornhauser family began to participate in the organization. Lin’s older brother Tom has worked on graphic design for Special Olympics. Her sister Or gives speeches on behalf of people with intellectual disabilities, while her younger brother Omer volunteers at competitions. Lin’s father, an orthodontist, works for patients with intellectual disabilities pro bono through the Healthy Athletes program offered to all athletes at Special Olympics events. Most notable, however, is Lin’s mother Tali, who found as much a sense of passion and purpose in her life through Special Olympics as Lin did. Tali joined the Board of Directors of Special Olympics Israel, leading a number of progressive causes for people with intellectual disabilities. She successfully lobbied the Israeli government to replace the usage of “people with retardation” in government texts to “people with intellectual disabilities,” marking a groundbreaking achievement of the r-word campaign in the Middle East. Today Tali is the Family Coordinator of Special Olympics Israel while also providing pro bono consulting work. She has achieved her own degree of prestige within the international Special Olympics community for her drive and benevolence, yet she asserts that Lin is the maker of her own success. “She is the leader,” Tali said of Lin. “I am the driver, the encourager for her, her supporter. Many say that she succeeds because of us. We say no.” Lin asks her mother to let her train for swimming even when it’s raining. She trains five times a week for multiple sports each day. Despite the fact that she was still crawling while her peers were running, Lin never gave up, exemplifying the pure endurance that defines a star. Lin has charmed everyone, from the President and Prime Minister of Israel to the C.E.O. of Coca-Cola. Yet she is characterized not just by her enigmatic personality and (literally award winning) smile. She is a master of her own destiny, a commander of her own success. “She has endless power,” Tali continued, lauding her daughter. “She has 99 medals from 14 years of competition. She hopes to get to 100 in Los Angeles.” Cheer on Lin as she competes in Bowling at the Special Olympics World Games Los Angeles 2015 beginning July 25th and tune in nightly on ESPN to celebrate the abilities of over 6,000 Special Olympics athletes from 165 countries!

While some view leaning on AI as “cheating” or producing “soulless” content, a nuanced examination reveals valid reasons for writers to utilize these tools responsibly.” AI can help writers overcome creative blocks and idea gaps. Even skilled writers sometimes struggle starting a new article or fleshing out an outline. ChatGPT and similar programs excel at brainstorming ideas, identifying knowledge gaps, and prompting writers towards new directions. Used judiciously during the drafting process, they enable writers to gain momentum and expand their perspective. Additionally, AI tools can catch writing mistakes that people overlook. The human brain often autocorrects small errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation and facts. But AI reviews content impartially, catching inconsistencies and mistakes that can undermine quality. When facing tight deadlines, writers can use AI systems to polish drafts faster and more thoroughly than reading repeatedly themselves. The key is approaching AI as an assistant, not as a replacement for original writing. The unique value writers provide is their authentic perspective, narrative voice, opinions and ideas. AI cannot replicate human creativity and emotional resonance. But a writer who conceptualizes ideas and expresses their core message, supported by AI refinement, produces high-quality content infused with their signature style. Some argue writers using AI are “cheating” and devaluing content quality. But this black-and-white stance ignores how writing inherently involves using tools, references and feedback. Even manually typing an article relies on technologies like computers, search engines and spelling/grammar checkers. Are these also “cheating”?

That’s when I discovered arbitrage and matched betting — techniques that take advantage of incentives from bookmakers to generate predictable profits with minimal risk.” Over the last two years, I’ve turned exploiting bookie bonuses into a $5,000 per year side hustle using an almost foolproof system. This article will explain how arbitrage and matched betting work, the process I use, and why virtually anyone can do it. Arbitrage betting capitalizes on different odds at various bookmakers for the same event. When the odds are misaligned enough between two sites, it creates an arbitrage opportunity — a situation where you can place bets that guarantee profit regardless of the outcome. This exploits the conflicting odds without any risk, since you cover both outcomes. The key is spotting those opportunities where odds between bookies differ enough. Matched betting utilizes bookmaker incentives like sign up bonuses and free bets to also generate risk-free profit. It works by “matching” a qualifying bet to activate the bonus with a lay bet on an exchange like Betfair that cancels out the risk. You get to keep the bonus payout regardless. Here is the step-by-step process I use to earn around $5,000 per year from arbitrage and matched betting: "

Recent advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have brought this concept closer to reality, making neural signals a viable option for secure user identification and authentication. In this article, we will explore the feasibility of using neural signals as passwords, the benefits this could provide, the current state of technology, and what future advancements are needed to fully realize this goal.” Most existing authentication mechanisms like passwords, PINs, and biometric scans have significant drawbacks when it comes to usability, security, and privacy. Passwords can be stolen, forgotten, or hacked while biometrics like fingerprints can be spoofed and raise concerns over privacy. Neural signals avoid many of these pitfalls while providing a method of identification intrinsically tied to the individual. Intercepting your thoughts or stealing your neural activity patterns is much more difficult than stealing a password you typed or a fingerprint left behind. Neural signals also have the potential for much greater security by having an incredibly large number of possible combinations. Research has found the human brain likely has a capacity to generate over a million different thought patterns. Compare this to the typical 8 character password with upper/lowercase letters and numbers which provides only 218 trillion different combinations. This increased security could allow neural passwords to replace or supplement existing solutions. A major factor enabling neural signals as passwords is the advancement of electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI technology over the past decade. EEG records the electrical activity of neurons firing in the brain using an array of non-invasive sensors placed on the scalp. Initially limited to research and medical settings, consumer-grade EEG devices have emerged which provide sufficient signal quality for authenticating users. These devices measure neural activity across different brain regions, recording the… "

It conjures up images of middle aged men splurging on sports cars, ditching their families for a new trophy wife, or dramatically quitting their jobs. Supposedly it’s a period of intense turmoil and reevaluation of one’s life. But emerging research suggests this dramatic crisis may be a myth. Midlife is an opportunity for growth, not necessarily a period of chaos. The concept of a midlife crisis first gained traction in the 1960s and 70s. Up to that point, middle age was viewed more positively — as a time of maturity, responsibility and purpose. But a 1965 article entitled “Death and the Midlife Crisis” planted a seed that there was a dark side. Psychologist Elliott Jaques argued that realizing one’s mortality in your 30s and 40s could lead to significant anxiety and upheaval. In the 1978 book The Seasons of a Man’s Life, author Daniel Levinson expanded on this theory of a “midlife transition”. Based on interviews with 40 men, Levinson argued middle age was a time of significant turmoil and reevaluation. The concept took off from there, becoming a permanent fixture in pop culture. It provided an explanation for why some people burn out and make dramatic changes in midlife. However, there was little quality research to back up this “crisis” theory. It may have been grounded more in social biases than science. While the idea of a midlife crisis took hold in mainstream thinking, researchers have started questioning the evidence behind it.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing.

But one announcement went swiftly past most of the media while being the one with the highest immediate impact on the AI market, as this new feature alone threatens an entire start-up ecosystem and billions of invested capital. Even OpenAI couldn’t have predicted it. Not even they saw ChatGPT coming. Over the last few months, we have seen multiple accounts from the top management on OpenAI like Ilya Sutskever, Mina Murati, and Sam Altman claim that when they released the open beta for ChatGPT back in November 2022 they didn’t expect it to have that huge access. In two months, it had already reached 100 million first-time users, and was already officially the fastest-growing… "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems. The signs started pretty soon after they celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary. "

Because it’s fun, entertaining, and can bring a sort of catharsis to the player, just like a good book or a film. Despite the bear market, the web3 gaming industry is holding up quite well. Some tokens are growing, and there are more and more new game premieres. Projects are focused on building. The traditional “gaming” industry is massive, and the numbers speak for themselves: there are 3.09 billion active video game players, and it’s estimated to be worth $217.06 billion in 2022. On the other hand, we have web3 gaming (with around 7 billion MCAP according to Coingecko) which many believe will slowly merge into traditional gaming with giants like Ubisoft or SEGA joining crypto. The crypto in the gaming component will bring not only lots of fun to the players, but also wealth in the form of amazing items (or tokens) in the web3 games that will prevail over this bear market.

Let me take you on a journey through my own financial escapade — one where the allure of a burgeoning trend collided with the rollercoaster of emotions. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, the allure of quick profits became almost irresistible. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) gripped me as friends and colleagues shared stories of astronomical gains. The promise of financial independence danced in my mind like digital coins on a blockchain. As I dove headfirst into the crypto world, emotions played a leading role. Excitement, fear, and impatience took turns steering the ship. The market’s wild swings became a daily emotional workout, with every dip and surge triggering a rush of adrenaline. My initial investment showed promise as the value soared, validating my decision. However, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market soon revealed itself. A sudden crash left me staring at red numbers and a sinking feeling in my gut. The societal hype that had fueled my entry into the market now seemed like a double-edged sword. To avoid being swept away by emotions, try this exercise. Before making a financial decision, ask yourself: — **What emotions am I feeling?** — **Am I making this decision based on fear, greed, or careful analysis?** — **How will this decision align with my long-term financial goals?** Did you know that in 2021, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined exceeded $2 trillion? This marked a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of digital assets. While the crypto journey was tumultuous, it taught me valuable lessons about the intersection of emotions and finance. Striking a balance between staying informed about societal trends and managing emotional responses is key. Financial decisions should be driven by a clear understanding of personal goals rather than the allure of short-term trends. Navigating the financial landscape is like surfing the waves of change; it requires skill, balance, and the ability to stay afloat when the waters get rough. So, before you ride the next financial wave, make sure your emotions are securely tethered to the fundamentals of your financial plan. 🏄‍♂️💰 "
https://medium.com/rand-corporation/why-are-u-s-military-families-experiencing-food-insecurity-2f8bad03e13b?source=author_recirc-----648a9505b2ab----0---------------------4fdebb68_25d8_4d87_a4d1_de6b14066b4e-------,"Suzy Malloy stood in her kitchen and wondered how this was possible: How, after so many years, she still could not afford to put enough food on the table. Her husband, after all, was a Navy SEAL. But the constant moves, the loss of her jobs, the housing expenses piling up — she knew she was going to have to go back to the food bank. Around a quarter of active-duty service members qualify as “food insecure,” a recent RAND study found. But what’s causing that, how to fix it — even what it means — is not at all clear. The lead author of the study, senior economist Beth Asch, summed up the findings as “just a whole slew of conundrums.” But they outline a major concern for the U.S. military: potentially tens of thousands of service members and their families struggling to get enough healthy food. Malloy and her family are now settled in Tampa, Florida. She works as the director of the local chapter of Blue Star Families, the largest chapter-based organization serving military and veteran families. Her husband, now a captain with the SEALs, expressed shock recently when he heard her say their family had once relied on food banks. That couldn’t be true … was it? “No, sweetheart, you never went to a food bank,” she told him. “We definitely, as a family, went to a food bank, regularly, and that’s how we ended up making ends meet. Food banks for us were a blessing. I’m forever grateful for them.” Food insecurity is not a new problem for the military. Sen. John McCain railed against having “soldiers on food stamps” during his presidential campaign — in 2000. More recently, Congress ordered the Pentagon to study how prevalent food insecurity is in the military, and to report back with solutions. The Pentagon turned to RAND. Researchers interviewed experts nationally and at local military installations, and reviewed administrative pay and personnel data. They also analyzed results from annual surveys given to active-duty members of the military service branches and the Coast Guard. The surveys included a series of six questions that the U.S. Department of Agriculture uses to assess food insecurity. They asked, for example, whether service members had cut or skipped meals in the past 12 months, and whether they had been hungry but did not eat. The USDA considers anyone who endorses two or more of those six questions to be food insecure. Around 25.8 percent of the service members met that definition. In fact, 10 percent of them endorsed five or six of the questions, which means they have very low food security under the USDA guidelines. RAND’s main findings come from surveys completed in 2018. But researchers also looked back at an earlier survey, from 2016. It gave service members another option for their answers: “almost never.” Based on the results of that survey, the researchers estimated that as many as 40 percent of the service members who qualify as food insecure might “almost never” experience food difficulties. Then came the conundrums. Service members generally make more in total compensation than similar civilians — yet they were nearly three times more likely to be food insecure. Service members who live on-post have access to military dining facilities, but those who reported food difficulties were less likely to use them. And more than two-thirds of the service members who said they were struggling to afford food also said they have emergency savings they could fall back on. The Army had the largest share of food-insecure members. But Army retention rates have been, according to the Army Times, “sky-high” this year. “We can’t tell from the data what’s really going on, or how people interpreted the survey questions,” Asch said. “My father often talked about growing up in the Depression and having empty cupboards. Is it that kind of food insecurity? Is it that, at the end of the month, you’re eating ramen all week? Before we can get to effective solutions, we need to better understand what this really looks like.” For Marla Bautista, it looked like a massive housing bill and some limp pork chops. Her family couldn’t find a home right away when the Army transferred her husband, a geospatial engineer, to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa a few years ago. They had to stay in an extended-stay hotel for several months — long after their Army-issued hotel vouchers ran out. She started visiting food pantries and cutting corners at the grocery store as her family sank deeper and deeper into debt. Her husband came home one night as she was cooking dinner. “What kind of meat is that?” he asked. “These are pork chops,” she informed him. “Those are the thinnest pork chops I have ever seen.” “I was like, look, this is what we can afford,” she says now. “We could not make ends meet. We were juggling bills, we were getting food from food pantries, we were doing whatever we could to be okay.” Bautista had to leave her job in New York when the Army told her husband he was moving to Tampa. In interviews with the researchers, family advocates pointed to frequent moves and the loss of spousal income as major factors in military food insecurity. The survey data backed them up. Service members who reported food difficulties were 10 percentage points less likely than others to have a spouse’s second income coming in. The military provides service members who live off-post with basic allowances for food and housing. But the food allowance only covers their meals, not meals for their families. And the housing allowance does not cover some expenses, such as traffic tolls, that come with living off-post. And, in an expensive city like Tampa, they don’t always reflect the true cost of housing. The last time Suzy Malloy stood in her kitchen, wondering how she would make ends meet, it was because her family was paying much more than its allowance to live in a decent school district. The researchers found a few other puzzle pieces as they reviewed the survey data and interviews. Nearly a quarter of food-insecure service members said they had recently provided unplanned financial support to a family member. People who work with military families said child care expenses — or the lack of child care — could also strain family budgets. So could big, unexpected expenses like a car repair bill. Military officials said predatory lenders might target young service members with little experience managing money. “Food insecurity is a multifaceted problem, which means it needs multifaceted solutions,” Asch said. “There’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all way to fix this. The worst thing is if we roll out a policy, spend millions of dollars — and then it doesn’t help the people who are really in crisis.” She is now studying whether paycheck volatility — “all of these special and incentive pays getting turned on and off” — might worsen the problem by making it hard for families to plan their budgets. Other researchers are convening focus groups with families to better understand their experiences with food insecurity. Asch and other researchers are also merging survey data with pay and personnel data to analyze the relationship between military compensation, financial literacy, and food insecurity to see if that clears up any of the conundrums. The Pentagon issued a plan last year to strengthen food security in the military, saying RAND’s findings would inform its efforts. It pledged to increase access to healthy food on-post, to review pay and benefits, and to start collecting more data. It also committed to helping more military spouses stay in the workforce. It is working, for example, on interstate agreements that would allow those in some professions — such as teachers or dental hygienists — to transfer their licenses when they move. Marla Bautista and her husband can laugh about those sad pork chops now. “We’re making ends meet,” she said. “We don’t have savings, but at this point, our bills are paid.” She runs a nonprofit, the Bautista Project, that provides services and support to people experiencing homelessness in Tampa. It also runs a food pantry for service members at MacDill Air Force Base. Most months, it serves at least 100 families. Suzy Malloy also helps distribute food to families at MacDill. “I’m so grateful,” she said. “I’m grateful for food, for having access to food banks — and now, being on the other side, I am so grateful that I can give back to those who are walking in the same steps I did. It just makes me sad that we haven’t figured this out.” She and Bautista have plenty of ideas for how the military could make life easier for military families. Improve access to federal food benefits. Review housing allowances to make sure they cover the actual costs of living off-post. Make sure service members — especially those in the junior ranks — make enough money to live a healthy life. And one more, from Malloy: “It should be mandatory,” she said, “for every military installation to have space for a food bank.” Around 1.4 million U.S. military veterans struggle to get the food they need to live an active, healthy life. Yet more than a third of them are not covered by the government’s main food-assistance program, RAND researchers found. In fact, food-insecure veterans are much less likely than nonveterans to get help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides monthly funds to help low-income families, elderly people, and people with disabilities afford food. But researchers found that some of the most vulnerable veterans are falling through the cracks. The oldest veterans, those 70 years old or older, were 10 percentage points less likely than similar nonveterans to get SNAP benefits. Veterans who can’t work because of a physical or mental illness were also much less likely to have accessed SNAP. The researchers found a possible clue when they looked at other benefits those veterans receive. Those who were not in the SNAP program received disability payments and other benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at higher rates than those who were in the program. Those benefits count as income and may push some veterans just over the eligibility line for SNAP. Most states — but not all of them — consider low-income households that qualify for other kinds of government assistance to automatically be eligible for SNAP. That, in effect, raises the income limit. Veterans in those states were more likely to be enrolled in the program. RAND’s findings point to a “critical need” to reduce barriers to SNAP assistance, researchers wrote. Federal policymakers should reconsider income eligibility rules, especially for older and disabled veterans. States should consider policies that encourage more low-income veteran households to sign up. Some veterans might not know that they qualify for SNAP. Others might stay away because of the stigma of receiving government assistance. Because of that, health care providers in and out of the VA should also screen all patients for signs of food insecurity. — Doug Irving Funding for this research was made possible by a generous gift from Daniel J.

It calls itself the black-eyed pea capital of the world. It claims the hamburger was born in a little café on its courthouse square. And its school district proudly proclaims itself the “Home of the 4-Day Instructional Week.” That last one resonates across rural America. In recent years, hundreds of small school districts like Athens have cut one day a week from their school calendars. Teachers love it. Parents tend to love it, too. Yet lawmakers in several states have started to question whether it’s really in the best interests of students. Researchers at RAND provided one of the most comprehensive looks at the costs and benefits of a four-day school week. They reviewed test scores, surveyed families, and traveled through three states interviewing students, parents, teachers, and principals. They found that a shorter school week can help small districts like Athens compete for teachers and cut some costs. But it also comes with small delays in student achievement. “The driving force, for us, was to find a way to make us unique so that we could offer some benefit to the teachers that they might not have elsewhere,” said Janie Sims, the superintendent in Athens, which was the first pre-K–12 district in Texas to switch to a four-day week. “It’s beautiful here. Our hope was that, if we could attract some high-quality teachers, they would stay with us once they got here.” “At this point,” she added, “we might have a mutiny if we decided to move away from it. Everyone loves it.” A four-day school week is exactly what it sounds like. Students typically start their school days a little earlier, and finish classes a little later — but in return, they get a three-day weekend every week. In rural areas, especially, kids often use that extra day off for chores, work, or family time. The shorter schedule also allows student athletes in far-flung districts a day to travel to games without missing class time. The idea has taken off in recent years. Small districts used it to cut costs in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Even more have turned to it in the stress-filled COVID era as a way to attract and retain teachers. By one estimate, only around 250 schools were operating on a four-day schedule in 1999. By 2019, the number was more than 1,600. Yet research on the pros and cons of a four-day school week had not kept up. Some small studies showed drop-offs in student achievement. Others showed small improvements. To provide some guidance to state and school leaders, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation asked RAND to investigate what exactly a four-day week means for students, teachers, and schools. Researchers interviewed nearly 500 students, parents, teachers, and principals across Idaho, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. They also surveyed more than 1,300 parents and 6,500 middle- and high-schoolers. Perhaps not surprisingly, 85 percent of the students in four-day schools said they liked the shorter week “a lot.” But 89 percent of the elementary-school parents in four-day districts also said they were mostly or very satisfied with the shorter schedule. Teachers were also mostly supportive of the idea, although a majority described it as little more than a perk. In focus groups and interviews, some did say they were willing to drive long distances just to teach at a four-day school. Others said they would retire if their district switched back to a five-day schedule. The researchers found that student attendance may have improved slightly at the four-day schools, but the difference was not statistically meaningful. They found that younger students reported getting more sleep, but not students in middle or high school. Districts were able to cut some costs by not operating on Fridays (or, less often, on Mondays), but the savings amounted to only a few percentage points from the annual budget. “A lot of the benefits that districts think they’ll enjoy, we couldn’t really find in the quantitative evidence,” said Christopher Doss, a policy researcher at RAND and former high school teacher, who helped lead the study. “Students definitely spend more time with their families, definitely have more time for hobbies. It’s just one of those things where communities need to make a decision about what trade-offs they’re comfortable with.” The big trade-off, RAND found, was in student achievement. Math and English test scores didn’t fall when schools switched to a four-day week. But they didn’t grow as fast as they did in similar districts in the same states that kept a five-day schedule. That meant students in the four-day districts fell behind a little more every year. After eight years, the gap was roughly equivalent to the achievement losses that schools saw during the pandemic. “The teachers and parents and administrators that we talked to were quick to say, ‘Year over year, we see our rank in the state the same or improving; we see our test scores improving,’” said policy researcher Andrea Phillips, a former middle school teacher, who co-led the study. “And that was true. They were improving. It’s just that their rate of improvement would have been higher if they had stayed at five days.” RAND published its study in late 2021. Other research since then has largely bolstered its findings and filled in more details. One study found that the four-day week may hurt reading scores more than math scores. A large study released last year found that the shorter schedule held back student achievement in small-town and suburban districts but had little or no effect in rural districts. In Warren County, Missouri, superintendent Gregg Klinginsmith had been fighting to stop an exodus of his best teachers. His small district lies about 15 miles from the suburban fringe of St. Louis, where teachers can make thousands of dollars more than he can offer. He switched to a four-day schedule a few years ago and said he hadn’t seen any drop-off in student test scores, although he was still waiting for more data to know for sure. But as a way to retain teachers, he said, the four-day week has been a game changer. “We just could not keep up,” he said. “The most important thing in a classroom is the teacher, and we wanted to have the best teachers in front of our children. I wish we could use money to do that and pay people what they’re worth. Unfortunately, we just don’t have the money to do that. Our retention tool is time.” The growing interest in a four-day school week in some ways parallels a shift toward four-day workweeks in the corporate world. A large survey of business leaders by Ernst & Young found that 40 percent were planning to implement a four-day week, or already had. Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House have twice introduced a bill to shorten the standard workweek to 32 hours instead of 40. Golden, Colorado, is experimenting with a 32-hour week for its police. But in some states that helped pioneer the four-day school week, lawmakers are starting to push back — often citing RAND’s findings. Oklahoma added accountability standards and required special waivers for schools operating on a four-day schedule. Missouri considered, but did not pass, legislation to block schools from shortening their schedules. So did Texas. Athens superintendent Janie Sims went to Austin to lobby against the Texas bill. Every one of her campuses earned distinction from the state last year in recognition of their academic achievement, she said. That had never happened before. Big employers in her town have shifted their own schedules so that parents can have a three-day weekend with their kids. “All of this is for naught if our students don’t achieve,” Sims said. “We believed, and still believe, that having the strongest teachers in the classroom makes that happen. That was the whole goal of this, to recruit them.” She used to go to job fairs, where she would sit in her booth, flanked by bigger districts who put their starting salaries in lights. She hasn’t been to one of those in years now. Teachers have a way of finding Athens through word of mouth, she said — and often, they come asking about the four-day school week. — Doug Irving This originally appeared on The RAND Blog on August 31, 2023.

A new focus on societal resilience could improve response and mitigation efforts when future disasters strike. To build the societal resilience required to respond effectively to everything from climate-related emergencies to pandemics, to intentional state-on-state attacks, and disinformation, a joined-up approach is needed, not only across government, but across wider society. In the UK, responses to such immediate crises have often involved calling in the military — for example to build London’s Nightingale Hospital during the COVID pandemic, or to fill sandbags and perform other tasks during floods. But asking the military to fix immediate problems isn’t enough. Recent government policy such as the Integrated Review in Defence has made it clear that government at least nominally recognises the importance of societal resilience. Yet there is a lack of clear lines of responsibility and designated stakeholders. Organisations like the National Protective Security Agency (NPSA) can address certain areas of resilience, such as protection of national infrastructure and intellectual property; but they may be ill-equipped to handle other tasks. The NPSA and Defence are national-level organisations, but when crises hit local government (such as the Local Resilience Forums) are often the first line of defence. However, local authorities may not be linked to the resources, or communications, available at a national level. Resilience is not a one-time, quick fix. Previous RAND work has made clear the importance of addressing all three phases of resilience: There’s been much study of international systems for doing this, with Nordic and Baltic countries drawing a lot of attention for their Total Defence models. While there are certainly lessons to be learned from these countries, the UK faces differing challenges. Most obviously, the countries closest to the UK are primarily NATO allies or other partners — and that makes it harder to build the public awareness of threat that can help build societal cohesion. The UK has other characteristics, though, that might offer unique strengths, including a long history of responding to disasters. Recent experience has also shown that the UK’s volunteer spirit is alive and well: take volunteering during the COVID pandemic as one example. There are already a number of organisations such as the National Consortium for Societal Resilience, the National Preparedness Commission and others working to try to draw attention to this issue. Rather than focusing on where the UK doesn’t measure up, there are three steps to that could help focus minds in the short term: clearly defining societal resilience across UK government and society, promoting public discussions within government and with broader society to engage stakeholders, and working to create consensus around the importance of dedicating resources (be that financial, personnel, equipment, time, etc.) towards this effort.

Levine, a freelance writer in Connecticut, describes her existence on the days that follow as “death on wheels.” Yet from the doctor’s office to the corner office, good sleep is often overlooked as a key part of well-being. We pay for that. Researchers at RAND and RAND Europe estimate that chronic insomnia pulls down the U.S. economy by more than $200 billion every year. Other major economies also forgo tens of billions of dollars in lost productivity. The condition is so debilitating, researchers found, that sufferers would pay 14 percent of their income to get better sleep. “We encourage this as a society,” said Levine, who documented her life with insomnia in a 2017 article for Prevention magazine. “Someone is always emailing, and then you respond and you get sucked down the rabbit hole, and then it’s 11 o’clock at night. We normalize it. There’s this idea that it’s good to be sleep-deprived, that you’re up and you’re busy.” Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the world. It blurs thinking, dulls concentration, and drives up the risk of workplace accidents. Some evidence suggests its prevalence has been on the rise since COVID scrambled routines and gave people something new to worry about at 2 a.m. One 2021 Canadian study found a fourfold increase in new case rates of insomnia during the early months of the pandemic. For years now, researchers at RAND and RAND Europe have documented the staggering toll that insufficient sleep takes on personal and economic well-being. One report, for example, estimated that Americans miss the equivalent of 1.2 million days of work because they don’t get enough sleep. Another showed how later school start times could boost student performance — and with it, state economies. Researchers have also pegged the cost of frequent nighttime visits to the bathroom at around $44 billion a year in lost productivity in the United States alone. But insomnia is different. It’s a disorder of sleep quality, not just sleep quantity. The researchers defined it as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or not getting enough restful sleep. People who have those symptoms three or more times a week — enough that they interfere with daily activities — have what qualifies as clinical insomnia. If those symptoms last for at least three months, it’s chronic insomnia. Workers who experience any symptoms of insomnia miss 14 days of work every year and spend another 30 days at work but not being fully productive, the researchers estimated. Chronic sufferers are absent for up to 18 days and present but not productive for up to 54 days. Using those numbers, the researchers calculated that the United States loses more than 1 percent of its total economic output to chronic insomnia every year. That adds up to around $207.5 billion. The United Kingdom loses 1.3 percent of its output every year, or $41.4 billion. France forgoes around $36.3 billion, and Australia and Canada both lose more than $19 billion. “What really makes people suffer is that it’s just so hard to get through the next day,” said Wendy Troxel, a senior behavioral and social scientist at RAND and an internationally recognized sleep expert. “I work with patients, so I see how widespread and debilitating insomnia is. But when you multiply all of these individuals across major nations, major economies, it really forces you to think about how the consequences affect societies as a whole.” The researchers estimated that one-third of the adults in the countries they studied experience at least some symptoms of insomnia. That’s 172 million people. Around 8 percent suffer from chronic insomnia — 42 million people fighting to get through the next day. Using survey data from the UK, the researchers then calculated what insomnia does to a person’s “life satisfaction.” They found that someone with insomnia would trade 14 percent of their income to attain the same life satisfaction as someone without insomnia. In the United States, that works out to $7,675. That’s more than what people would pay to not have asthma or arthritis. “And yet, nobody ever seems to ask you how you sleep,” said Marco Hafner, a senior economist and research leader at RAND Europe, who coauthored the study. “You go to a doctor, and they might ask about what you eat, whether you exercise — but they almost never ask, ‘How do you sleep?’” That should change, the researchers wrote. Primary care doctors should screen for sleep problems the same way they screen for diabetes or depression. Governments and health care systems should provide access to affordable, effective treatment for sleep disorders, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. That’s especially important for lower-income, Black, or American Indian and Alaska Native people. Research shows that minoritized racial/ethnic groups have higher rates of certain sleep disorders and sleep disturbances, yet remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Employers should also foster a sleep-friendly culture. That means no more emails at 11 p.m. But it also could mean providing offices with windows or special lighting to preserve the circadian rhythms that promote healthy sleep/wake cycles. Public health campaigns could drive home the message that sleep is foundational for health and wellness — and that putting away the screens before bed can be downright therapeutic. It’s not always easy. As a working parent, Hallie Levine said the quiet hours before bed are often the only uninterrupted time she has to write or answer emails. But she’s more careful now about limiting distractions when she gets into bed, and her insomnia has eased some. She doesn’t have as many “death on wheels” mornings as she used to. “I definitely still have nights when I wake up at 3 in the morning and can’t get back to sleep,” she said. She joked that on those nights, she might consider paying half her salary for a few more hours of good sleep — “but the irony is, you don’t need to spend that much money. It doesn’t cost anything to meditate or listen to relaxing music or read a book. It’s just so hard for us to de-stress and decompress.” Insomnia may cost the world tens of billions of dollars every year, RAND researchers noted — but there’s another way to look at it. Help is often available. Effective treatments do exist. Doing more to recognize and address insomnia could be an opportunity to save the world tens of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity. — Doug Irving Funding for this research was provided by Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

This unexpected decision comes on the heels of a series of developments that have left experts questioning the future of the intersection between artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Quantum computers, the next frontier in computational technology, operate on the mind-bending principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers using bits as zeros or ones, quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. It’s a cosmic leap in computing power with the potential to revolutionize various fields. NASA’s quantum computer project, in collaboration with Google, had been making strides in exploring the possibilities of this cutting-edge technology. However, recent events have thrown a wrench into their cosmic aspirations. The U.S. government, expressing concerns over the rapid developments in quantum computing, made an unprecedented move by requesting NASA and Google to shut down their quantum computer projects. This decision has left the scientific community in a state of bewilderment, especially considering the potential benefits that quantum computers could bring to space exploration, cryptography, and other advanced technological fields. Prominent figures in the scientific community, including luminaries like Michio Kaku and Elon Musk, have long warned about the potential dangers of unchecked developments in both AI and quantum computing. Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has gone on record stating that the danger of AI surpasses even that of nuclear warheads. His concerns revolve around the rapid progress of AI, which he claims is capable of far more than most people realize, with exponential rates of improvement. "

As most cases require the GenAI model to have “long-term memory” almost every enterprise solution requires a vector database the model can query at run time to retrieve the context required to answer the user inquiry. But, according to researchers from Cornell University, the now once-thought as highly secure solution hides a troublesome truth that could cause huge privacy concerns. Also, this discovery gives us tremendous insights into one of the most unknown components of frontier AI models today. If there’s a ubiquitous element in today’s frontier AI, that is embeddings. Embeddings sit at the core of models like ChatGPT, and almost all progress made over the last years in AI can be traced down one way or another to these elements. When working with non-numerical data, for decades, AI researchers found themselves with an insurmountable problem. Classical computers — the computers still used to this day — only understand ‘1s’ and ‘0s’. Not letters, or audio waves. Only those two numbers. Therefore, how do we express information from the world so that machines can understand it? "

She loved Coach bags, high-end clothing, and weekend trips with the girls. Her kids lacked for nothing and she got a new kitchen remodel and brand new deck. She had very high expectations and requirements to keep up with her friends. But her husband’s income didn’t match up with her champagne tastes on a beer budget. Her husband Gabe was not on board with trying to keep up with others. He had grown up frugally and liked living in a smaller home, that they could manage financially. But his high-maintenance wife wanted a bigger and splashier home and lifestyle. The only problem was she did not work and did not even try to get a job. She just figured her husband would cover everything and debt would fill in the cracks. Her husband would constantly get compliments that “he was a lucky man” and that his wife was hot. Little did they know, Mandy’s pampering budget was sky-high every month. Mani/pedi, massage, facials, new clothing, makeup, a gym trainer, and Whole Foods were Mandy’s key to staying attractive. Even though she was 39, she didn’t really need Botox yet but still got it done once in awhile. As anyone knows from Tiktok reveals, makeup and filters can drastically change a Plain Jane (what Mandy really was) into a “hot” woman. Conventionally, she was plain but all the makeup and filters made her look like a Real Housewife. And she lived for the attention. Gabe relished being envied by his friends and family for his “hot” wife. Even though she was a pain in the ass financially, he loved being admired and envied. It was kind of sad he got his self-esteem from what others thought of his wife. But that’s the kind of person Gabe is. But all this pampering and preening led to big financial problems.

As my Silent Generation (the generation older than the Baby Boomers; there are about 20 million of them in America) mother is still alive, I used to get a good chuckle at those stories as I thought, “Pretty wishful thinking, there, everyone, I’m pretty sure most of the Baby Boomers are still going to be alive twenty (if not thirty) years from now.” And the retirement and long-term care years of the Baby Boomers? Those are going to be long and expensive years. This subject has slipped my mind of late, but recently I heard a story on the radio program Marketplace that covered this very truth. In the story, the reporter talked about her spouse’s grandmother Sue, whose spouse died when she was in her late 80s. As a consequence, her grandson (the reporter’s spouse) had to take over doing her finances and helping her. In return, the grandmother pledged that he would inherit everything when she died. When the grandmother did die, more than a decade later, she only had two thousand dollars left to leave to the grandson. Not many people would do a job (and often a worrying and stressful job like helping an older person figure out finances and costs and long-term care) for a solid decade if they thought they would net two thousand dollars. The hourly pay rate would be measured in pennies. The journalist further pointed that their family was lucky — the grandmother was a fiscally responsible person who had saved a lot of money for her retirement and nursing needs, so the grandson and his family were not responsible for paying for her care out of pocket. (Which is a very real possibility for some families.) All of this is not to say that the only reason we ever take care of people is because we are paid to do so. But with families increasingly stretched by the distances between family members— both literally, as when… "

Despite popular opinion, it is one of the safest and lowest carbon forms of energy. It is also one of the few on-demand forms of low-carbon energy. As such, it will be a crucial technology as we transition to net-zero. However, the nuclear industry faces a massive problem: it costs too much. New nuclear power plants cost tens of billions of dollars and take well over a decade to build, and once built, the energy they produce is some of the most expensive on the market. This has led many governments and energy providers to distance themselves from this planet-saving technology. But a new type of reactor called an SMR promises to solve all of these issues and kick-start a nuclear renaissance, saving the nuclear industry. However, a pioneering SMR project has just been cancelled because costs are ballooning out of control. So, the question has to be asked: is the future of nuclear energy doomed? Possibly not. Let’s start at the beginning: what is an SMR? SMR stands for Small Modular Reactor. Typical nuclear power plants have several enormous custom-built reactors. These are incredibly complex and must be carefully and accurately assembled on-site. This skyrockets the construction cost and deployment time. SMRs solve this by using reactors small enough to be fully assembled off-site in a controlled factory and then shipped to the location. These reactors produce less power, so you need more of them, generally over 10, to make a power plant. However, the overall cost of these reactors per MW of power should be far cheaper than regular reactors, as the factory can use economies of scale to lower prices. Deployment should also be far quicker, as reactors can be built ahead of time, and their small nature and controlled production facility make construction far quicker. There is even a flexibility advantage, as an SMR plant can add or remove reactors quickly to better meet demand. Ordinary reactors take decades and billions of dollars to expand their output. ** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky** Several companies are pioneering SMR technology. But, the company spearheading the SMR movement is… "

I’m also doing an afternoon session for middle-schoolers at the Stratford Public Library. Politics always requires coalitions. In parliamentary democracies, the coalitions are visible, when they come together to form the government. In a dictatorship, the coalitions are hidden to everyone except infighting princelings and courtiers (until a general or minister is executed, exiled or thrown in prison.) In a two-party system, the coalitions are inside the parties — not quite as explicit as the coalition governments in a multiparty parliament, but not so opaque as the factions in a dictatorship. Sometimes, there are even explicit structures to formalize the coalition, like the Biden Administration’s Unity Task Force, which parceled out key appointments among two important blocs within the party (the finance wing and the Sanders/Warren wing). Conservative politics are also a coalition, of course. As an outsider, I confess that I am much less conversant with the internal power-struggles in the GOP and the conservative movement, though I’m trying to remedy that. Books like Nathan J Robinson’s Responding to the Right present a great overview of various conservative belief-systems: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/14/nathan-robinson/#arguendo And the Know Your Enemy podcast does an amazing job of diving deep into right-wing beliefs, especially when it comes to identifying fracture lines in the conservative establishment. A recent episode on the roots of contemporary right-wing antisemitism in the paleocon/neocon split was hugely informative and fascinating: https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/know-your-enemy-in-search-of-anti-semitism-with-john-ganz/ Political parties are weak institutions, liable to capture and hospitable to corruption. General elections aren’t foolproof or impervious to fraud, but they’re miles more robust than parties, whose own leadership selection processes and other key decisions can be made in the shadows, according to rules that can be changed on a whim: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/30/weak-institutions/ Which means that parties are brittle, weak vessels that we rely on to contain the volatile mixture of factions who might actually hate each other, sometimes even more than they hate the other party. Remember the defenestration of GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy? That: https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-327e294a39f8de079ef5e4abfb1fa555 Even outsiders like me know that there’s a deep fracture in the Republican Party, with Trumpists on one side and the “establishment” on the other side. Reading accounts of the 2016 GOP leadership race, I get the distinct impression that Trump’s win was even more shocking to party insiders than it was to the rest of us. Which makes sense. They thought they had the party under control, knew where its levers were and how to pull them. For us, Trump’s win was a terrible mystery. For GOP power-brokers, it was a different kind of a nightmare, the kind where you discover that controls to the the car you’re driving in high-speed traffic aren’t connected to anything and you’re not really the driver. But as Trump’s backers — another coalition — fall out among each other, it’s becoming easier for the rest of us to understand what happened. Take FBI informant Peter Thiel’s defection from the Trump camp: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel was the judas goat who led tech’s reactionary billionaires into Trump’s tent, blazing a trail and raising a fortune on the way. Thiel’s support for Trump was superficially surprising. After all, Thiel is gay, and Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, openly swore war on queers of all kinds. Today, Thiel has rebuffed Trump’s fundraising efforts and is reportedly on Trump’s shit-list. But as a Washington Post report — drawing heavily on gossiping anonymous insiders — explains. Thiel has never let homophobia blind him to the money and power he stands to gain by backing bigots: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/12/silicon-valley-billionaire-donors-presidential-candidates/ Thiel bankrolled Blake Masterson’s Senate race, despite Masterson’s promise to roll back marriage equality — and despite the fact that Masterton attended Thiel’s wedding to another man. According to the post, the Thiel faction’s abandonment of Trump wasn’t driven by culture war issues. Rather, they were fed up with Trump’s chaotic, undisciplined governance strategy, which scuttled many opportunities to increase the wealth and power of America’s oligarchs. Thiel insiders complained that Trump’s “character traits sabotaged the policy changes” and decried Trump’s habit of causing “turmoil and chaos…that would interfere with his agenda” rather than “executing relentlessly.” For Trump’s base, the cruelty might be the point. But for his backers, the cruelty was the tactic, and the point was money, and the power it brings. When Trump seemed like he might use cruel tactics to achieve power, his backers went along for the ride. But when Trump made it clear that he would trade opportunities for power solely to indulge his cruelty, they bailed. That’s an important fracture line in the modern American conservative coalition, but it’s not the only one. Writing in the BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller and Lee Hepner describes the emerging conservative split over antitrust and monopoly: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/is-there-an-establishment-plan-to Antitrust has been the centerpiece of the Biden Administration’s most progressive political project. For the left wing of the Dems, blunting corporate power is seen as the necessary condition for rolling back the entire conservative program, which depends on oligarch-provided cash infusions, media campaigns, and thinktank respectability. But elements of the right have also latched onto antitrust, for reasons of their own. Take the Catholic traditionalists who see weakening corporate power as a path to restoring a “traditional” household where a single breadwinner can support a family: https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-capitalism-becomes-tyranny-with-sohrab-ahmari There’s another reason to support antitrust, of course — it’s popular. There are large, bipartisan majorities opposed to monopoly and in favor of antitrust action: https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Antitrust_Policy_poll_results.pdf Two-thirds of Americans support anti-monopoly laws. 70% of Americans say monopolies are bad for the economy. The Biden administration is doing more on antitrust than any presidency since the Carter years, but 52% of Americans haven’t heard about it: https://www.ft.com/content/c17c35a3-e030-4e3b-9f49-c6bdf7d3da7f There’s a big opportunity latent in the facts of antitrust’s popularity, and the Biden antitrust agenda’s obscurity. So far, the Biden administration hasn’t figured out how to seize that opportunity, but some Dems are trying to grab it. Take Montana Senator John Tester, a Democrat in a Trump-voting state, whose campaign has taken aim at the meat-packing monopolies that are screwing the state’s ranchers. The right wants in on this. At a Federalist Society black-tie event last week during the National Lawyer’s Convention, Biden’s top antitrust enforcers got a warm welcome. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s top antitrust cop, was praised onstage by Todd Zywicki, whom Stoller and Hepner call “a highly influential law professors,” from George Mason Univeristy, a fortress of pro-corporate law and economics. Zywicki praised the DoJ and FTC’s new antitrust guidelines — which have been endlessly damned in the WSJ and other conservative outlets — as a reasonable and necessary compromise: https://fedsoc.org/events/national-press-club-event Even Lina Khan — the bogeywoman of the WSJ editorial page — got a warm reception at her fireside chat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwdAxOSznE And the convention’s hot Saturday ticket was “a debate between two conservatives over whether social media platforms had sufficient monopoly power that the state could regulate them as common carriers”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwoO7bZajXk This is pretty amazing. And yet…lawmakers haven’t gotten the memo. During markup for last week’s appropriations bill, lawmakers inserted a flurry of anti-antitrust amendments into the must-pass legislation: https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/fsgg-approps-bill-must-support-enforcers-not-kneecap-them/# These amendments were just wild. Rep Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) introduced an amendment that would give companies carte blanche to stick you with unlimited junk fees, and allow corporations to take away their workers’ rights to change jobs through noncompetes: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/269 Another amendment would block the FTC from enforcing against “unfair methods of competition.” Translation: the FTC couldn’t punish companies like Amazon for using algorithms to hike prices, or for conspiring to raise insulin prices, or its predatory pricing aimed at killing small- and medium-sized grocers. An amendment from Rep Kat Cammack (R-FL) would kill the FTC’s “click to cancel” rule, which will force companies to let you cancel your subscriptions the same way you sign up for them — instead of making you wait on hold to beg a customer service rep to let you cancel. Another one: “a provision to let auto dealers cheat customers with undisclosed added fees”: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr4664rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr4664rh.pdf Dems got in on the action, too. A bipartisan pair, Rep Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep Lou Correa (D-FL), unsuccessfully attempted to strip the Department of Transport of its powers to block mergers, which were most recently used to block the merger of Jetblue and Spirit: https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/640 And 206 Republicans voted to block the DoT from investigating airline price-gouging. As Stoller and Hepner point out, these reps serve constituents from low-population states that are especially vulnerable to this kind of extraction. This morning, Jim Jordan hosted a Judiciary Committee meeting where he raked DOJ antitrust boss Jonathan Kanter over the coals, condemning the same merger guidelines that Zywicki praised to the Federalist Society: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jxc8dp8erhe1q3wpndre/GOP-oversight-hearing-memo-11.13.23.pdf?rlkey=d54ur91ry3mc69bta5vhgg13z&amp;dl=0 Jordan’s prep memo reveals his plan to accuse Kanter of being an incompetent who keeps failing in his expensive bids to hold corporate power to account, and being an all-powerful government goon who’s got a boot on the chest of American industry. Stoller and Hepner invoke the old Yiddish joke: “The food at this restaurant is terrible, and the portions are too small!” Stoller and Hepner close by wondering what to make of this factional split in the American right. Is it that these members of the GOP Congressional caucus just haven’t gotten the memo? Or is this a peek at what corporate lobbyists home to accomplish after the 2024 elections? They suggest that both Democrats and Republican primary contesters in that race could do well by embracing antitrust, “Establishment Republicans want you to pay more for groceries, healthcare, and travel, and are perfectly fine letting monopoly corporations make decisions about your daily life.” I don’t know if Republicans will take them up on it. The party’s most important donors are pathologically loss-averse and unwilling to budge on even the smallest compromise. Even a faint whiff of state action against unlimited corporate power can provoke a blitz of frenzied scare-ads. In New York state, a proposal to ban noncompetes has triggered a seven-figure ad-buy from the state’s Business Council: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/noncompete-campaign-raises-state-lobbying-18442769.php It’s hard to overstate how unhinged these ads are. Writing for The American Prospect, Terri Gerstein describes one: “a hammer smashes first an alarm clock, then a light bulb, with shards of glass flying everywhere. An ominous voice predicts imminent doom. Then, for good measure, a second alarm clock is shattered”: https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-10-business-groups-reflexive-anti-worker-demagogy/ Banning noncompetes is good for workers, but it’s also unambiguously good for business and the economy. They “reduce new firm entry, innovation by startups, and the ability of new firms to grow.” 44% of small business owners report having been blocked from starting a new company because of a noncompete; 35% have been blocked from hiring the right person for a vacancy due to a noncompete. : https://eig.org/noncompetes-research-brief/ As Gerstein writes, it’s not unusual for the business lobby to lobby against things that are good for business — and lobby hard. The Chamber of Commerce has gone Hulk-mode on simple proposals to adapt workplaces for rising temperatures, acting as though permitting “rest, shade, water, and gradual acclimatization” on the jobsite will bring business to a halt. But actual businesses who’ve implemented these measures describe them as an easy lift that increases productivity. The Chamber lobbies against things its members support — like paid sick days. The Chamber complains endlessly about the “patchwork” of state sick leave rules — but scuttles any attempt to harmonize these rules nationally, even though members who’ve implemented them call them “no big deal”: https://cepr.net/report/no-big-deal-the-impact-of-new-york-city-s-paid-sick-days-law-on-employers/ The Chamber’s fight against American businesses is another one of those fracture lines in the conservative coalition. Working with far right dark money groups, they’ve worked in statehouses nationwide to roll back child labor laws: https://www.epi.org/blog/florida-legislature-proposes-dangerous-roll-back-of-child-labor-protections-at-least-16-states-have-introduced-bills-putting-children-at-risk/ They also fight tooth-and-nail against minimum wage rises, despite 80% of their members supporting them: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/04/leaked-documents-show-strong-business-support-for-raising-the-minimum-wage/ The spectacle of Republicans in disarray is fascinating to watch and even a little exciting, giving me hope for real progressive gains.

https://medium.com/@SpecialOlympics/the-walls-we-cannot-see-4d790df4374a?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Dear fellow Uniters, Last week, I was blessed to be a part of the spirit and joy of the Special Olympics World Games in Berlin, Germany. Some 7000 athletes with intellectual and developmental challenges from 185 countries and territories were the stars. Like any Special Olympics event near you, volunteers served, law enforcement leaders carried the flame of hope, health care practitioners checked and treated athletes, coaches shouted and cheered and cried, athlete leaders shared their vision and experiences, and fans, friends, and families were blown away. But unlike your local Special Olympics games, these games were in Berlin. The opening ceremony was in the Olympiastadion where no Olympic event had occurred since 1936 when Adolf Hitler was the head of Nazi Germany and spread his violent creed of Aryan Supremacy. At those games, Jesse Owens embarrassed the Nazi hate machine with his skill and bravery, winning four gold medals. “I let my feet spend as little time on the ground as possible,” he explained. His gravestone is inscribed with these words: Jesse Owens: “A master of the spirit…of sports.” This year, the spirit of Jesse Owens burst forth in that same stadium, shining from the souls of the athletes of Special Olympics. They came in humility and simplicity — some having been locked away, others excluded from schools and teams; all familiar with the stares and scorn of a world that still devalues them. I stood with 50,000 cheering fans in the stands where Hitler stood as the athletes marched in, overpowering and outshining his legacy of hatred. We watched every color and culture in the world march onto the track where Owens himself ran. Tears poured out and every fan stood to cheer when the delegation from Ukraine entered the stadium with arms raised high. For the first time in nearly 90 years, an Olympic torch entered that stadium — this time carried by brave athletes like Sana, a 12-year-old girl from rural Pakistan who was chained only 2 years ago and whose smile as she sprinted around the track was brighter than anyone could describe or understand. The games anthem, “Are you ready?” blared as the crowd rocked and danced and cheered. In the days that followed, Berlin was the most welcoming city on earth. I wish I had words to capture what I saw — at the track, on the basketball and tennis and volleyball courts, in the pool — all over the city. “Let me win,” the athletes all repeat, “but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.” Bravery was E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E! For anyone searching for a reason to believe that humanity can change, look at the videos and stories of the athletes of Berlin and their brave work of tearing down walls. For anyone wondering if we can overcome the division in the world, look to the champion athletes of Berlin who showed themselves to be the world’s experts at transforming division into healing. For anyone feeling lonely and anxious, look to the welcoming athletes of Berlin and their tireless invitation: “Come join us. We welcome everyone. We are leading an inclusion revolution. No judgement. Just dignity for all.” Berlin is of course famous for its wall — a wall that was raised in 1962 to divide people. My uncle, President Kennedy, visited Berlin in 1963 and spoke of the shared human hunger for freedom in his immortal words, “Ich Bin Ein Berliner.” Why did he say that? He was from Boston after all. And just 18 years earlier, he had fought in a war against the very people who stood in front of him that day. I believe he said it to take us beyond sympathy to solidarity. I think he knew that to identify with someone — literally to say, “I am you” — is as profound a gesture of love and connection as anyone can make. His words awakened the world and awakened us all as we commemorated the 60th anniversary of his speech last week. As we know, the Berlin wall fell in 1989 — overnight. Of course it fell. Division is not sustainable. It never has been and it never will be. There’s nothing more inhuman that hating your fellow humans and nothing more destructive than the fear that comes from division. The Special Olympics movement exists to prove that point over and over again. And that’s exactly what the athletes did as they cycled and ran and paddled and lifted and embraced the spirit of competition all week long. They seized their moment, exerting a power that makes intolerance crumble — a joyful force against which the heaviest and highest walls don’t stand a chance. This is the challenge of our time: how to heal the fear of difference and treat everyone with dignity. For Special Olympics athletes, their struggle to tear down the walls of fear and contempt does not end in Berlin. Over many decades, they have worked to shutter the doors of institutions that incarcerated them and claim their rightful place in the community. That struggle continues. Over many decades, they have worked to make schools place of inclusion. That struggle continues. Over many decades, they have worked to hold a job, to see a doctor, to play sports, to have families. All those struggles for dignity continue. So many people still see a person with an intellectual challenge and think they need to be fixed. They don’t need to be fixed. There’s nothing broken. All they need is what everyone needs: to be treated with dignity. To be seen as possessing a wild and transcendent beauty. Nothing less. Nothing more. At the closing ceremonies, my friend Jimmy Demers sang, “Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me.” Some 25,000 people milled around the Brandenburg Gate in downtown Berlin as he sang. Sana was there, beaming with her medals and taking selfies. Nyasha Derere from Zimbabwe who was homeless a few years ago, was there is his jacket and tie, trading pins and thanking everyone he met. People were embracing spontaneously as if it were natural to embrace strangers. Nobody’s feet were on the ground. Lightness was everywhere. I know we live in divided times. I know so many of us are lonely and feel like giving up. I get it. But there’s another world out there for us all. I don’t say that because of my faith. I say it because of my experience. I was in it. And I know we can create it for each other if only we try. As the song of the games asks, “Are you ready?” From the depth of our souls, I hope we can all answer “yes!”  In unity Tim "
https://medium.com/@SpecialOlympics/depoliticizing-the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-effort-lets-turn-to-youth-with-intellectual-cc673b675579?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------,"Dr. Jacqueline Jodl, Chief, Global Youth & Education, Special Olympics Despite the general buzz around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), progress has been slow, and its advocates are falling well short of their goal of creating more inclusive and cohesive communities. One of the world’s most marginalized populations — young people with intellectual disabilities (ID) — has been left out of the conversation. Teaching and fostering inclusion from the perspective of this community (unlike many approaches to DEI) places high emphasis on reducing fear and shame among those who are in the position to be “includers.” By doing so, the message of inclusion from young people with ID places a premium on affirming the central importance of healing and supportive relationships. The message of young people with ID is not the weaponized versions of the divisive and extreme political left and right, but the apolitical, non-polarizing, and door-opening message of inclusion and acceptance of differences for the more than 240 million children with disabilities around the world. Special Olympics’ history dates back fifty years to the civil rights movement in the United States. The organization’s current footprint extends to nearly 200 countries around the world. Grounded in decades of research and practical knowledge,[1] our movement has fostered inclusion in ways that have avoided the pitfalls of greater division and tribalism. Our approach is simple: by teaching children to play together, they can learn, grow, and ultimately thrive together. The emerging evidence on these shared experiences reveals that they are transformative to young people’s development because they contribute to what is called an “inclusive mindset.” The research indicates that the core elements of such a mindset are universal and teachable. An inclusive mindset motivates people to reach out to others because it equips them with the skills, beliefs, and behaviors that make being inclusive achievable and rewarding. Most importantly, an inclusive mindset goes beyond how one thinks and feels to empowering the individual to risk their own social standing to be an upstander for others, even when such behavior might lead to stigma or social ridicule. To understand a young person’s choice to include, Special Olympics partnered with the EASEL Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education to develop an explicit, evidence-based framework for inclusive mindsets and behaviors. The framework is designed to address the renewed — and deserving — interest in barriers to DEI from the unique perspective of the experiences and hopes of people with ID. The framework also offers concrete solutions for meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by clearly defining and operationalizing the teaching and scaling of inclusion in schools, sports, and other learning settings. The partnership between Special Olympics and the EASEL Lab has uncovered that weaving the fabric of inclusion is a process for both the head and the heart. Despite all the noise in the world around what inclusion really means, it turns out that most young people, regardless of their identities, experiences, or intellectual differences, describe inclusion in remarkably similar ways — being treated with dignity, respected for their differences, and valued for their contributions to their school or community. Young people with ID are important and necessary voices who deserve a seat at the table. These voices foster inclusion through the celebration of differences. And the approach they bring is one that is evidenced-based and apolitical — that stands as an antidote to loud and divisive voices, that bridges rather than divides. An approach we can all embrace and emulate. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — [1] Yin, M., Deeza-Mae, S., Hussey, M., Bernacki, H., & Smith, A. (2021).

Welcome to Gothenburg. In our Lord´s garden there are many flowers. Some grow on trees, others on the ground. Some grow on top of others, smothering them and taking their air, making it difficult for them to live and grow. And then there are human flowers with all sorts of colours. You — Special Olympics athletes are the human flowers of this world. You have a special ability to transmit happiness, spread joy, show genuine care for each other and give love without a hidden purpose. There are not many human flowers like you. How wonderful it is to be amongst you in this arena to mark the Opening Ceremony of the Special Olympics Sweden National Games 2016. I invite you to stand up and show Sweden the wonderful human flowers that you are in all your glory. Hug each other and wish your fellow athletes good luck. You have come from all over Sweden to show the nation what you can do. You have trained hard and you understand and enjoy sport in ways that many have forgotten how to. You want to win, and while trying you help others to win also. You spread joy, happiness and sunshine. You melt hard hearts and you know how to express genuine feelings of love. I want those who did not travel to Gothenburg this time to be here next time to witness what Special Olympics really means. Your joy is contagious. Your talent and skills are to be admired and your determination to be copied by all. Next year I hope many of you will go to Austria to fly the Swedish flag brightly at the World Winter Games 2017 as you did at the Los Angeles World Summer Games in 2015. I want you — the most fantastic human flowers to continue blowing the winds of change all over the world, shining with your sunny smiles reaching every corner of the globe where your precious, special brothers and sisters are mistreated. They need your joy and solidarity. The world needs more than ever the love, joy and happiness that you are so wonderfully skilled at spreading. The Sports revolution has started. We are standing up to those who try to put you down. Thank you and I now declare the Swedish Special Olympics National Games 2016 Open. "
https://medium.com/specialolympics/what-playing-unified-has-taught-me-232297625c7a?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------,"The following post is written by Brad Gardner, a student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Three years ago I was asked to organize a unified flag football team at the University of Alabama. Without any prior experience or knowledge of Special Olympics Unified Sports, I was unsure of what to expect. All I knew was that in a few weeks, our unified flag football team would take on Louisiana State University for the first time. I began to piece together a team of 10 college students and 10 Special Olympics athletes from Tuscaloosa. For everyone, it was their first time participating in Unified Sports. In fact, most of the Special Olympics athletes and Unified Partners had never met each other prior to the first practice. However, over the course of 10 weeks our team practiced and grew together. Friendships were formed that lasted on and off field. With the support of ESPN, the game garnered the attention of the numerous fans from both teams, the Governor of Alabama, the Million Dollar Band, and other notable VIPs. What started as only a team of 10 Unified Partners and 10 Special Olympics athletes has now turned into a team of nearly 400 college students and 50 Special Olympics athletes from Tuscaloosa. Now a senior at The University of Alabama, I can honestly say that Unified Sports has provided some of the best memories in college. My teammates and I have been fortunate enough to travel all across the United States ranging from Los Angeles for the 2015 Special Olympics World Games, to Ohio for the NIRSA National Championship Series in Unified Basketball, to Auburn and Baton Rouge for the Special Olympics Unified Sports Rivalry Series. The friendships and memories that have been formed through Unified Sports will certainly last a lifetime. Through my participation I began to learn: #1: Breaking down barriers is a hands-on job There are things you cannot learn in the classroom or through lectures. Once you participate in Unified Sports, and the playing field is leveled, you gain a better understanding of individuals with intellectual disabilities. You begin to realize that they too deserve to have a valued spot on our teams, in our communities, and in our lives. #2: Abilities > Limitations Rather than comparing limitations, it is time to start celebrating everyone’s different abilities. Everyone has a unique gift to offer and it is okay to be different. Abilities differ, and this is what helps shape who we are as people and as a community. #3: Anything is possible through teamwork One of the most powerful tools on this planet is a team. A team can be a force for innovation that can help bring individuals with and without intellectual disabilities together. When you are unified towards a common goal, barriers are broken and labels of “abled” and “disabled” fade away. When you have a cohesive team of friends working together, things that once seemed impossible become possible. The #PlayUnified movement is empowering individuals with and without intellectual disabilities to be tomorrow’s leaders of change on and off the field. By playing unified, we can bring down intolerance and help make communities accepting and respectful for all. Although we are celebrating reaching 1.2 million unified teammates worldwide, there is always room on this team! Sign up to #PlayUnified today: www.playunified.org.

https://medium.com/specialolympics/the-un-global-day-of-parents-reminds-us-of-the-other-side-of-sport-d9c207e0aa95?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------,"EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a guest post by David Evangelista, Acting President & Managing Director of the Special Olympics Europe-Eurasia Region. Early morning practices. Evening team meetings. Coach counseling. Relentless training. Long travel to tournaments. Competition after competition. Incessant logistics. Athlete training and competition brings with it a myriad of additional tasks, duties and responsibilities that one may not see on the medal podium but without them, there simply can be no participation. Behind each Special Olympics athlete there are parents and caregivers that make all of it possible. In so many ways, big and small, present and invisible, it is they that make so much of the Special Olympics Movement real. The European Union and United Nations asks us to position sport not as a marketing right, but as a human right. Perhaps more than anything, the most marginalized groups across the world consistently reiterate that sport is so much more than kicking a ball, running a race, or scoring a basket. Within a global context defined more and more by fear and division, the athletes of Special Olympics offer a stark contrast to the prevailing messages of the day: instead of cynicism, they play with hope. Instead of greediness, they play with a love of the game. Instead of nationalistic rivalries, they celebrate excellence in effort and bravery among all. Their victory is not only the result of the same hard work that all athletes put in, but also of the courage to overcome extraordinary obstacles and redefine what is possible. What most distinguishes a Special Olympics athlete is that when they play they never compete with anyone but themselves. Their only aim is to do one thing: their best. They invite others to discover the best within themselves. And it is the parents and caregivers that understand the depth, simplicity and power of this proposition more than anything. Today on 1 June the global community is being asked to mark The Global Day of Parents proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 2012 to celebrate parents across the world. In the world of Special Olympics every day is Parents Day. Research shows that active involvement from parents have a strong positive effect on the academic and life skills of children with intellectual disabilities, as well as on their adult lives. But they cannot do it on their own. EU-wide platforms such as the European Alliance for Families and COFACE — the Confederation of Family Organizations in the European Union — of which Special Olympics is a member, work on supporting parents of children with disabilities. Such meaningful collaboration extends the reach of family support networks, allowing parents to connect and share with one another. In numbers comes strength. The positive attitudes passed from one parent to another can reach across the borders of member states and enable more learning, advocacy, change and hope. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recognizes the role of families in the lives of people with disabilities and serves as a milestone for the promotion and achievement of equality and human rights across Europe. Various obligations under the CRPD commit policymakers to ensure families can fully and equally realize the rights enshrined in the text. In Special Olympics, there are thousands of parents with powerful stories to tell. Giuseppe Montemurri is the father of Filippo, a Special Olympics athlete with Down syndrome. He remembers that shortly after Filippo was born, another parent of a child with Down syndrome encouraged him by saying, “Your kid will be terrific if you help him in the right way.” This thought never left his mind. As part of his commitment, Giuseppe created a Special Olympics Family Support Network across Italy to involve parents in activities such as family camps and social camaraderie. There was no shortage of community-based engagement available to empower parents. As a Global Family Leader for Europe, Giuseppe is striving to bring more families into the Special Olympics network. Anna Kozak-Zapala is a coordinator for the Special Olympics Poland Early Childhood Development program. Seven years ago she gave birth to her son Filip who was born with intellectual disabilities. She discovered the Special Olympics Young Athletes Program which has transformed both of their lives. Young Athletes is about sport and play, but more importantly about creating the critical bonds between parent and child. Having worked as a physiotherapist, Anna knew this program would help her son’s development and her own. She took the initiative and started a Young Athletes Club in her son’s kindergarten. Special Olympics, together with key partners like UNICEF, Lions Clubs International, and many more, take the play of sport very seriously. For children and young people with disabilities, it is the electrical current that has the power to shed light on what is otherwise a life shadowed in darkness. It is, for many Special Olympics athletes, the single opportunity to shed their labels and simply serve as a teammate, a position, an accepted part of the whole. It is this electricity of sorts that has brought over 5,000,000 Special Olympics athletes with intellectual disabilities to the field, to the court, and to the sports complex. Who creates this electrical current that brings so much energy, positivity and progress to the world? It is the parents and caregivers of Special Olympics athletes. That is truly something at which to marvel. NOTE: This guest blog is cross-posted on BlogActiv.eu. "
https://medium.com/specialolympics/why-the-crc-is-important-to-special-olympics-bd94d7020c80?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------,"EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a guest blog by Mark Engman, Director of Public Policy & Advocacy for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. You may have seen the tweet recently from Dr. Timothy Shriver, Chairman of Special Olympics, regarding the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the “CRC”. Here at the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, we really appreciated his willingness to speak up for the rights of children. Of course, Special Olympics has been a huge supporter of the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD), and my organization is proud to join them in that cause. The CRC and the CRPD are two sides of the same coin. The CRPD focuses on the rights of all people with disabilities, and mentions children; the CRC focuses on the rights of all children, and mentions disabilities. In order for organizations like Special Olympics and UNICEF to fight for the rights and well-being of all children, and make sure they participate in societies as agents of change and not just recipients of charity, nations need to support both the CRC and the CRPD. Sadly, the United States has not ratified either human rights treaty. However, there is one difference between the two treaties: President Obama sent the CRPD to the Senate for its consideration; but, though it was signed 21 years ago, the CRC has never been sent to the Senate. Unbelievably, the United States stand alone: we are the only nation in the world that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. A nation with nearly 74 million children[1], including at least 3 million children with a disability,[2] has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The purpose of the Twitter campaign #SendTheCRC was to send the President a message that Americans care about child rights, and want him to take action on the CRC before he leaves office in January 2017. Many different nonprofit organizations that care about children, including Special Olympics, banded together to share this message. We must keep reminding our political leaders, and our fellow Americans, that rights matter. Our sincere thanks to Dr. Timothy Shriver, Special Olympics, and most of all the athletes of the Special Olympics Movement, for standing up for the rights of all people with disabilities and all children. I know that, working together, we will see a day soon, when the United States joins the rest of the world in ratifying both treaties.

https://medium.com/specialolympics/reviewing-the-state-of-health-care-on-world-health-day-2016-178b2a863277?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"Editor’s Note: This is a guest blog by Dr. Matthew Holder, MD, MBA. In addition to his roles as Global Medical Advisor for Special Olympics and Global Clinical Advisor for the MedFest discipline of Special Olympics Healthy Athletes®, Dr. Holder is the CEO of the Lee Specialty Clinic and President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry. Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt. As the Global Medical Advisor for Special Olympics I have heard this, the Athlete Oath, more times than I can remember. Yet every time I hear it, I become more inspired. Not only by the meaning of the words, but by the symbolism of our athletes taking that oath. It is a reminder that on the path to success, there are no excuses. There is no acknowledgement of the limitations that others may place on you. In these words there is only a relentless pursuit of giving your all and achieving your best. As I write these words today, there is a young mother who is living the spirit of the athlete oath on behalf of her daughter. Her daughter, Lily, is only a few months old and is in desperate need of a transplant. Under different circumstances Lily would already be on the transplant list. But Lily is different. The doctors believe that Lily will have an intellectual or developmental disability when she grows up and because of this, she is not on the transplant list. In essence, the medical community has deemed her life to be less than equal to the lives of other children. On a ventilator and struggling to stay alive, Lily is unaware of what she symbolizes and the difference that her existence in this world may make. Lily’s mother is refusing to give up and she is challenging the medical system to give her daughter a chance. The fight going on around Lily is emblematic of the struggle that people with intellectual disabilities face around the world every day. The fight for Lily’s life goes far beyond the abilities of medical science. It goes beyond the availability of scarce resources. The fight for Lily’s life is a fight against prejudice, inequality, and injustice. It is a fight that in no ambiguous terms shows how we treat those who are deemed, with the permission of society, to be of lesser value. In the United States today, it would be hard to fathom the public outcry if doctors refused to give a transplant to somebody because of their gender or their skin color. It would be hard to imagine the public outcry if people were denied organ transplants because they didn’t score high enough on an IQ test. And yet here we are. Lily is too young to have an IQ test, but just the fear alone that she might one day have an intellectual or developmental disability is enough for the medical community to not allow her to be a candidate to receive a transplanted organ. In a country that prides itself on equal protection under the law, Lily is fighting for her life, because she and millions of people like her are not seen as equals. I have seen scores of different healthcare systems in the United States and around the world. I have seen health systems in highly developed countries and in still developing nations. I have seen socialized and non-socialized systems. I have viewed these systems not through the lens of some World Health Organization survey or a newspaper article or a politician’s speech, but through the eyes of our Special Olympics athletes. Though I have seen the results of all manner of healthcare systems, I have only one commonality to report: there is no healthcare system in the world that provides adequate care to people with intellectual disabilities, and this is precisely because in almost every society around the world, people with intellectual disabilities are not held as equals. In order to address this problem, we have to address other factors like time, education, and attention. This is why I am so proud of the work that is being done through the Special Olympics Health program, made possible by the Golisano Foundation, and specifically the focus on Healthy Communities. The Healthy Communities program is seeking to change the way that people with ID are integrated into their health systems around the world, one community at a time. By bringing attention and visibility to the health needs of people with ID, the Healthy Communities program is developing a large network of organizations and individuals who will include people with intellectual disabilities in their daily work. This might mean better access to potable water in Africa, a more inclusive medical school curriculum in Southeast Asia, a stronger healthcare referral network in the United States, better health promotion activities in Europe, or better insurance coverage in Latin America. But most importantly, each Healthy Community is identifying the biggest barriers to health equity for people with ID and attempting to address them. On this World Health Day, as each of these systems’ changes takes hold, we slowly but steadily march forward toward the goal of health equity for people with ID. We continually strive to make these advancements knowing that we may not ever be satisfied with what we have accomplished, but knowing that by striving, we can change the world and make it a better place for people with ID and, truly, for all people. We do this for the sake of our athletes and for children like baby Lily, who we hope one day will know a world that, instead of turning away from her because of her possible limitations, will embrace her because of her limitless possibilities.

https://medium.com/specialolympics/spread-the-word-leaders-wanted-882c9afc9fc5?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------,"Editor’s Note: This post is adapted from a memo sent on March 2, 2016 to Dr. Ben Carson, Sec. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Ted Cruz, Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Mr. Donald Trump from Dr. Timothy Shriver, Chairman, and Loretta Claiborne, Vice Chair, Special Olympics International. Politics today are reviving a culture of name-calling and bullying. To some, it seems to be working. Mock, taunt, and humiliate someone and you win. The behaviors of the vicious and the cruel are being offered as models of leadership for the country. There is, however, another way to lead. For the last eight years, athletes and partners in Special Olympics and Best Buddies International have challenged their friends and leaders to ask this question: “How can we lead the world to be more welcoming?” The question isn’t theoretical to them. For most of recorded history, leaders have failed to include or even humanize people with intellectual disabilities. When the world bullies and excludes, our athletes and buddies know what happens: vicious and mean labels like “moron,” “idiot,” “imbecile,” and “retard” are translated into social cruelty, injustice, and routine suffering. Words matter. Today is Spread the Word to End the Word® day. At a basic level, the athletes and buddies of our movement are asking people to stop using the word “retard” as a taunt or a joke. It hurts and humiliates. Please stop. But at a larger level, what they ask today is deeper: become a leader of unity. Don’t just change your language; change your heart. Challenge yourself to be open to difference, unafraid of being welcoming to someone who is different, willing to take a chance on a person who just might be the teammate or a friend you never expected to find. We’re all afraid of people we don’t understand or know. But we can heal that fear. Join a team. Volunteer. Be a friend. Play unified and live unified, too. Kathleen Shriver, a longtime Special Olympics unified partner, coined a new way of expressing the mission: “difference is dope!” These words are not just fun and refreshing. They are words to live by. They are also an invitation to Spread the Word to End the Word® “retard.” So let’s start now. Dr. Carson: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Secretary Clinton: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Senator Cruz: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Governor Kasich: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Senator Rubio: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Senator Sanders: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Mr. Trump: Will you pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use of the R-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities? Our country deserves leaders who are role models of unity. Today is the day for our candidates to commit to being such leaders. If they do, they will be following great leaders like Eddie Barbanell, who has Down syndrome and who knows how important it is to unify a nation. “It’s insulting, it’s painful and it hurts people, get that word out! End the word! Bury it!” The next President needs to follow Eddie in burying the word “retards” and in burying bullying, intolerance, and injustice. We need a leader who will take a stand and support respect for people of all abilities. Will you join us and take the pledge today at r-word.org? "
https://medium.com/specialolympics/the-magic-of-faces-ea0a6a1e2cca?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------,"EDITOR’S NOTE: The following post is a guest post by renowned Dutch sports photographer Robbert Wijtman whose image from the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles entitled ‘I just won’ was awarded 1st Prize in the category Photograph Emotion at the inaugural Sport Media Pearl Awards in Abu Dhabi in December 2015. Below Wijtman explains the vision and significance of his shot of Special Olympics Norway athlete Katarina Norberg. Photography is an art. You know it when you see it. Much photograph is snapshots, then you see photographywhere the photographer has taken the time to capture what he wants. My image ‘I just won,’ of a Special Olympian judoka saviours a victorious moment. The image was shot with a 70–200 f2.8 in a room that was not well-lit. The athlete had just won a hard fought semi-final battle with a nice throw, earning an ippon or one total point. She was still on course to win the gold medal. I had just come from the Pan American Games in Toronto and I was very tired coming to Los Angeles. I went to the judo and saw Katarina. She was across the room and it was a difficult shot. She was developing her face and I waited and waited. Faces intrigue me. I always look for how people move, how they walk, how their faces are. I could see her face changing as she realized she had won. There were ten other photographers but they were focusing elsewhere. A lot of photography is luck, but then having the vision of what you are trying to say — her sudden understanding of her position. Before she had a confused look. Her face comes out, the innocence of it. The photo represents the essence of sports — human nature in its most naked form. I had a deep connection with the athletes at the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles and I intend to return to capture magical moments at many more Special Olympics events in the future. The effort and the training they put in — it’s a night and day difference with professional athletes. They do it for the love, that overcoming of obstacles is a reflection of life. "

Today, as on every 10 December, our global society recognizes and celebrates the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Day. A day in which we, as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says, “Recommit to guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms protecting the human rights of all.” Make no mistake, a guarantee of that magnitude is a large undertaking. It is a goal that by the very nature of being human each of us simply must be invested in actively working toward. At Special Olympics we use the power of sports to help people with intellectual disabilities discover new strengths and abilities, skills and successes. Our athletes find joy, confidence and fulfillment — on the playing field and in life. Yet our athletes often find roadblock after roadblock in their everyday lives that prevent them from finding that joy, from discovering those abilities. What’s the biggest roadblock? The stigma and intolerance of being perceived as different. I hear stories everyday from all corners of the world — both developed and non — about a lack of access to health care, education and social services. All things that millions, if not billions, of people around the world take for granted as accessible. More often than not the reasons I hear for this lack of access involve a lack of understanding or willingness to include people perceived as different. This stigma and intolerance is persistent everywhere. On 8 December BBC News reported that in 2011 a man named Andrew Waters was wrongly assigned a “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) order while he was a patient at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent in England. Among the reasons listed for Andrew’s DNR according to the BBC’s report were his “learning difficulties and Down syndrome.” The BBC went on to report that no one in the Waters’ family was consulted or made aware of the DNR during Andrew’s stay in 2011. The family only found out because they found a note about it in Andrew’s belongings after he was discharged. Sadly, Andrew passed away this past May at age 53 from causes separate from the issuing of the 2011 DNR. Only recently has the hospital taken responsibility by admitting they breached Andrew’s human rights and apologized to the family. It’s worth noting that Andrew’s story took place in a highly developed nation, in a town with a tourist visitation website that boasts about “artistic charm” “traditional holiday-town charm” “world class art galleries” “sandy beaches” and a “cool café culture.” According to the site, “Margate is in the midst of a cultural renaissance. It’s exciting, it’s energising and you’re invited to take part.” The harsh reality for many people with intellectual disabilities is the invitation to take part simply isn’t extended to them. This is where it is up to us to make a difference. The violation of Andrew Waters’ human rights should be a wake-up call to the persistent absence of value afforded to people with intellectual disabilities. It is imperative that individuals, communities and governments act at all times to ensure people with intellectual disabilities enjoy the same rights and protections as everyone else. We need your help to fight the stigma and intolerance facing people with intellectual disabilities around the world. So on this UN Human Rights Day, help stand up for Andrew and the nearly 200 million people around the world with intellectual disabilities that he represents. You can start making a difference right now. Share this post on your social media platforms with the hashtag #HumanRightsDay to help raise awareness about our urgent work. Join us in your local community by visiting www.specialolympics.org. Most importantly, know that it’s the little gestures that will end the stigma and intolerance. So the next time you get to interact with a person with an intellectual disability be sure that whatever you are doing, you invite them to take part. "
https://medium.com/@OlympicSailing/leme-lapa-2604bb112478?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------,"Our second full day in Rio was a free day, meaning we had no yours planned for the day. We decided to tackle two items that I hadn’t been able to check off when I was here earlier this month- visiting the historic Lapa neighborhood and the Morro do Leme park. Leme is just a few blocks from our hotel in Copacabana so we went there first. The park is inside an army compound- it seemed to me like an officer school or something. The Morro do Leme is a hill with an old military fort at the top. What makes this place special, though, are the monkeys that call the park home! After we visited the monkeys and completed the climb, we took a taxi to Lapa to see the aqueducts and the Selaron Steps. After a quick lunch we climbed the steps. They were built by a Chilean artist named Jorge Selaron, who began repairing the steps outside his home with scavenged, brightly-colored tiles. Soon, it turned into an art project and visitors began donating tiles of their own. The steps are now a major tourist attraction in southern rio. After the steps we bid Sarah goodbye as she flew out that night. Meg and I had another layday the next day, enjoying Copacabana and Ipanema beach before heading to the airport ourselves for our flights to the states! "

The falls straddle the border between Brazil and Argentina, and Paraguay is just a few hundred yards up river. Both countries have national parks surrounding the water falls. The Argentinian side has about 75% of the falls, and the Brazilian side has a larger park area with fewer falls. However, you can see the entirety of the Argentinian side from Brazil. We arrived late at night so had dinner and went to bed. The next day was a full day tour of the Argentinian side. Then, the following day was a half day tour in Brazil, and then we were off to the airport for our flight to Rio! "

This was when we learned that, despite the title “Four-Day Trek,” we would only actually hike for two days. Interesting…! On our way to the trailhead we drove up and down mountains and valleys, through farms and flatlands. The pitch of the hillsides and sharp turns made for a wild ride. We arrived in Cancha and met up with our cook and horseman. Rather than porters, our company, ITC, uses horses to carry equipment. Sarah and I carried day packs with water, extra layers and snacks while the horses carried our tents and other gear. The day started with a steep climb of nearly 1,500 feet to the top of a mountain, over about three hours. The elevation at the top was around 14,500 feet- the highest I’ve been as the Grand Teton, in Wyoming, which was my previous highest peak, is 13,776 ft. We made our way down into a valley for lunch beside a lake. Along the way we met a few friendly llamas and skittish chinchillas. We ate lunch and had a short siesta before hiking another 1.5 hours to our campground in Quishaurani. Here we made camp, had dinner and went to bed early as I had a splitting headache from the thin air, and Sarah was feeling awful. My altitude sickness worsened through the night, but luckily we both felt a bit better by morning. The next days’ schedule included an ascent above 15,000 ft which we decided to skip, and headed down and around instead to avoid more altitude issues. We made our way down the Lares Valley to the village of Lares and the Lares hot springs, where we enjoyed the natural baths and lower, warmer climate. In the morning we took public busses from Lares to Calca (Where we would have ended up if we finished the second ascent) and from there to Otitambo and Ollantaytambo. We then boarded a train from Ollantaytambo to Auguas Calientes, another town with a hot spring that is a 20 minute bus ride outside of Machu Pichu. The train was the “Vista Train” from Peru Rail. The Windows extended into the ceiling of the cars to better see the surrounding mountains and changing landscape. We travelled from steep, rocky mountains, brown in the midst of winter, to a milder climate, green and lush, dotted with Orchids. (Still mountainous!) After arrival, we checked into our hotel and crashed- a shower! A bed! It was a lovely change. Today, we will take a bus at 9 am to Machu Picchu, explore the ruins and meet up with our third travel companion, Meaghan before boarding a train back to Cusco for our final night in Peru. Details and photos from Machu Picchu soon! Here are some more photos from our trek: "
https://medium.com/@OlympicSailing/clear-across-the-continent-635b5d7fd4fd?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------,"Rio-Sao Paulo-Lima-Cusco When we reach Peru, at first the landscape isn’t a startling difference to the Rockies or Appalachian mountains I’ve flown above at home. The earth looks like a piece of paper someone crumpled in their fist and then tried to smooth away. There’s nothing drastic about this landscape. As we continue further west and a little north, the valleys grow deeper, the rivers wider and the peaks taller. When we’re just south of La Paz, the first snow capped mountains start to dot the horizon. It’s winter here. As we fly over the bigger ranges, the turbulence increases and we move in and out of clouds. When we emerge from a particularly large one, the ground has turned blue. Lake Titicaca. My new Swiss photographer friend in Rio told me a joke about this lake- it’s a little inappropriate but imagine him saying it in a thick Swiss accent, on the back deck of in a hole in the wall restaurant on top of a hill in Santa Theresa, Rio. “The locals say that Lake Titicaca is shaped like a Jaguar. There are two villages on Titicaca, one on the belly of the jaguar and one near the rear. That’s where Titicaca gets its name.” Maybe it was the Caprihinas, but it was hilarious to me! We fly back over more mountains, back to a a gentler landscape, and the it all disappears over the horizon with the approach of the Pacific Ocean. Atlantic to Pacific in five hours. "

(I join my friend Sarah in Peru tomorrow, and my friend Meaghan will join us a few days after that for Argentina and a return to Rio for more sightseeing.) I went on a jeep and hiking tour in Tijuca Forest- one of the largest urban forests in the world, taking up more than 15 square miles inside of Rio de Janeiro. It was raining like crazy when I woke up this morning but by the time we reached the forest entrance in the hills just outside of Ipanema, the rain had petered off to a light drizzle and then stopped all together. It made the rainforest even more green and it smelled SO good and fresh! About Tijuca: In the late eighteenth century, much of it was cleared for coffee and sugar plantations, but the removal of the trees caused so much flooding (there’s a lesson here!!) in the city below that in the 1860s the emperor Dom Pedro commissioned a reforestation project. Since 1961, Tijuca has been a protected national park, a true oasis inside the city limits- like stepping into the Amazon for a few hours! Here are some photos from the half-day jaunt. We were supposed to have a full tour of six people, but three others backed out due to the weather. Their loss! We headed back to Copacababa, where the meeting point for the tour was. Our little gang of three had such a fun time that we decided to have lunch together at a restaurant on Leme beach- it was SO good! Endless seafood and meat. I couldn’t eat dinner after that meal! That’s all for now as in 6 hours (2 am) my car arrives to take me to the airport for my 5 am flight to Cusco (via Sao Paulo and Lima). More from Peru, soon! "

Tricky, variable, challenging; these words were used over and over again in press conferences and interviews by the sailors who competed on Guanabara Bay. With seven racecourse areas placed around the bay, World Sailing and the IOC put together one of the challenging regatta venues in recent Olympic memory. The Pao de Acucar course, where all medal races were contested, was one of the trickiest, situated in the shadow of Sugarloaf Mountain, causing the wind to move in unpredictable patterns at times as it swirled off the mountains and buildings nearby. The weather in Rio lived up to its reputation, delivering a handful of light and puffy days interspersed between days with 20+ knots of breeze and 4–6 meter swell. Sailors who excelled in Rio had to be comfortable taking on any weather challenge, in addition to taking on the rest of their fleets for a chance at an Olympic medal. The difficultly of the venue was reflected in the overall score lines of even the best sailors, as was the high level of competition in the fleets. A number of top finishers, including some medalists, had UFD or DSQs on their scorecards. Most were ultimately throw outs in the end, but these penalties prevented them from tossing any higher race finishes off of their docket.

Photo finish. Any of these are excellent descriptors for the 49erFX medal race, in which the Brazilians Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze battled to the last for the gold — and the only medal that the host country would win in sailing at the Rio Olympic games. It almost didn’t happen for the Brazilians, who were in a three way tie going into the medal race with and Denmark’s Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen and Spain’sTamara Echegoyen Dominguez and Berta Betanzos Moro. New Zealand’s Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie were just a point outside.
